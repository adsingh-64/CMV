    This directory contains pairs of argumentative threads made in reply to the same original post, one successful and one not (more details in Section 4 of the paper). Both files have the same format and store data for training and heldout testing respectively. Each line is a json object for a pair. A pair has the following fields:
        op_author, op_text, op_name, op_title, positive, negative.
    "positive" is a list of replies in a rooted path-unit that won a delta from OP, while "negative" is a matching rooted path-unit that did not win a delta. "op_author", "op_text", and "op_title" give information for the original post. "op_name" is an identifier that can be used to find more submission-related information in the corresponding file in all/.

op_task/
    train_op_data.jsonlist.bz2
    heldout_op_data.jsonlist.bz2

    This directory contains the selected original post (OP) data used to investigate malleability (more details in Section 5 of the paper). Both files have the same format and store data for training and heldout testing respectively. Each line is a json object for an original post. An original post has the following fields:
        selftext, name, title, delta_label.
    "delta_label" shows whether the OP changed her opinion (True if she changed her mind, False if not). "selftext" and "title" provide textual information. "name" is an identifier that can be used to find more submission-related information in the corresponding file in all/.
