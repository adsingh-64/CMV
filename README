Trial project on Winning Arguments (Tan et al 2016) that replicates pair prediction task using the GPT-4o API.

}

Winning_Arguments.pdf is the write-up of the experiment.

GPTAPI.py can run the "basic" and "explain-then-predict" set-ups (see pdf), and GPTAPI2.py runs the "explain-then-predit-2" set-up.

Model responses from 500 "explain-then-predict" runs are stored in explain_then_predict_together.jsonl,
and model responses from 500 "explain-then-predict-2" runs are stored in explain_then_predict_separate.jsonl.
