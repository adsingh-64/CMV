I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat. Just the sound of her voice made all hairs on my body rise like a cat. Everyday, physically and mentally, she'd wale on me. I *knew* if I wanted, if I *truly* wanted to, I could easily defend myself. I was defiantly in a situation where if we replaced my mom with literally any other human on Earth I would have broke their jaw. She'd pin me against a wall and call me a fag and hit me and hurt me, and I'd take it. Every. Last. Hit. The only thing that every stopped me was knowing I wasn't allowed to. I never knew why, but I knew I couldn't. Because of some fucked up child memories, to this day I still can't take a photo of myself without breaking down or look myself in the eyes or even say i'm \"happy.\" She would call me a sadist and a pessimist, and as years came on I slowly developed these personas. My entire life revolves around the time I spent with her. I cant even count how many times I've wanted to kill myself. I dont say this to attention-whore my way into your web browser, but to use my story as a example. Child abuse fucks people up, badly. I believe the best way to avoid this is to allow a child to hit his parents back, strictly in self defense alone \n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;Child abuse fucks people up, badly. I believe the best way to avoid this is to allow a child to hit his parents back, strictly in self defense alone\n\nI grew up in a similar situation to the one you described, with an alcoholic, physically and verbally abusive father between the ages of 10 and 18. It wasn't until I got a little bigger around 16 that I started hitting back, eventually leading to more serious physical altercations between him and I when I was 18, with our last big fight being the last time I've spoken to him (I'm 26 now).\n\nThat said, there are two things in particular I took from that experience which I believe are contrary to \"this should be customary\";\n\n1. Hitting the man back back didn't make him any less likely to pick fights with me as the years went on, i.e., it did nothing to reduce the level of abuse going on at the time.\n\n2. At the time, being able to hurt him the way he had hurt me over the years *did* bring a (very short-lived) sense of satisfaction, this feeling that he was \"getting what he deserved\". However, that satisfaction never translated into long-term resiliency against the *psychological* effects of his abuse; eight years later, I'm still dealing with avoidant personality disorder and other PTSD-related issues directly related to it. While hitting him back may have helped reduce the number of hits I took during any given altercation, it did nothing to \"defend\" against the long-term psychological repercussions of his actions.\n\nWhile I agree that defending oneself from a physical aggressor, be they muggers or their own parents, should not be looked down upon (and believe you'd be hard-pressed finding someone who disagrees), based on my own experience with a physically abusive parent, fighting your parents shouldn't be seen as a customary way of avoiding future emotional/psychological distress from said abuse.\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI don't want to even claim to tell you what to do. You're an adult and in charge of yourself. That being said, you might want to try to talk with someone who is trained to help people in your situation. There might be services out there that can help you out in your current life. \n\nKids in situations like yours come up with coping strategies to make their situation better. It seems like that's what you did. Even if looking back you made choices you're not proud off it wasn't your fault. You mom was in teh wrong and you were dealing with it. \n\n For some hitting back would be an excellent coping strat. For others it would just escalate the problem\n\njust a question, Are you pretty good at judging other people's mood? Can you tell how someone is feeling just by looking at them?\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the first response's blending of personal experience with a thoughtful, structured critique of the original poster's argument.

Bush years (2000-2008) will be perceived by future generations as a dark age in world history.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIf any of you frequent /r/badhistory, there is a rather infamous [chart](http://i.imgur.com/zbue8vU.jpg) that captures a popular perception of the Middle Ages as a \"dark age\" that retarded scientific progress by over 1,000 years. This perception is incorrect but is still commonplace. I believe that the Bush years will be viewed similarly by future generations for the following reasons:\n\nThe much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.\n\nBush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.\n\nClimate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.\n\nImperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.\n\nEconomic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been [reversed](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/timworstall/files/2015/01/oxfam1.jpg) by this fucking crisis. Global equity markets are now [as US-centric](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12) as they've ever been since at least the Eighties, meaning that \"the rise of the rest\" has been an utter illusion.\n\nErosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony \"development\" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.\n\nTL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W.

Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.\n\nDifferent methods of counting ballots led to different results.  The methods originally used by the state of Florida, the one proposed by Al Gore's campaign in his lawsuit, and the one used by the Supreme Court all tallied GWB as victor.  The one proposed by the Florida State Supreme Court had Al Gore winning.  I think a newspaper-sponsored recount after the fact (with another, different set of standards) also found that Al Gore got more votes.\n\nBasically, it was a tie, and it turns out in that case the Supreme Court is the tiebreaker.\n\n&gt; Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.\n\nHow?  When has something like that ever happened?  In reality, there was a large body of international opinion that the US should not even go into Afghanistan after Al Queda.  Many foreign governments were on board with it, but their peoples weren't.  If we'd never gone into Iraq all the same people would still hate us.\n\n&gt; Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.\n\nDo you seriously think Obama has made any serious progress on global climate change? How about Clinton?  If the US quit using coal tomorrow it would have no practical effect on climate change.  You need an international consensus and, obviously, electing Obama had no effect on that.\n\n&gt; Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) \n\nCorrelation is not causation.  And if our espionage had been better we would never have gone to war in Iraq in the first place.\n\n&gt; and led to the installation of **treasonous quisling governments** around Europe.\n\n... What in the world are you talking about?\n\n&gt; Economic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. \n\nGuess who forced mortgage giants to start using subprime mortgages in the first place?  Guess who kept Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from being audited in 2005?  Guess who's decided to still keep them alive today?  In all three cases, it was democrats, not GWB.\n\n&gt; The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been reversed by this fucking crisis.\n\nI don't understand how \"share of global wealth\" is a good way to look at well-being.  A better measure is how many people worldwide are actually living in poverty, and [there are fewer and fewer of them](http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/).\n\nSecond Response: \nFirst, let me say that I believe Bush was a horrible president, and the country is considerably the worse due to his \"leadership\".  But, I think you are way overstating his influence.\n\n**Bush v. Gore**\nYes, I think the Supremes blew it.  But it was in some ways a testament to our democracy that everyone accepted the process.  The peaceful transition of power, particularly in an unsatisfying way (and whichever way it went, half the country was going to be unsatisfied) is still relatively rare in the world.  I'm far more concerned about Citizens United or gutting the Voting Rights Act, which I think we have a much greater impact on elections and the governance than the Bush v. Gore where I can at least understand the votes.\n\n**Squandered Opportunity for peace**  Agreed, we dropped the ball on this one.  But it wouldn't have stopped Russia's love of imperialism.  It wouldn't have stopped Muslim extremism in the Middle East.  Maybe an FDR could have forged something out of it - but Gore wasn't talented enough of a politician to create a coalition of nations dedicated to wiping out the poverty and ignorance that leads to extremism.  And it was early enough in his term that he wouldn't have the skills, relationships or staff capable of helping him accomplish this.\n\n**Climate change** Congress was not going to pass legislation that would hobble the US economy for the sake of the future.  The threat isn't immediate enough (or perceived as certain enough by most people) for people to support the sort of extreme action that would be required.  Yes, Gore would have worked to reduce our speed in that direction, but he alone couldn't have made a significant enough difference.  He wasn't charismatic enough.  Plus, post 9/11, people would have had other priorities.\n\n**Imperialism**.  Americans were scared shitless after 9/11.  Gore would have been forced to respond.  Likely, as a democrat, he's be under huge pressure to not \"be soft\" on terrorism.  I don't think he would have invaded Iraq, but probably would have done so in Afghanistan.  He would have also taken similar steps on domestic spying.  Remember, this is a guy whose wife lead the \"parental advisory warning on CD's\" movement - not a huge civil libertarian.\n\n**Economic Instability** This can't all be pinned on Bush by a long shot.  [NPR did a great series](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money) on how the global economic boom created this unprecedented pile of money that needed to be invested somewhere, which lead to the popularity of \"mortgage-backed securities\", which lead to stupid loans, which lead to the global economic collapse.\n\nThere's no question that the amount of [disposable income in countries like China](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/26/news/economy/china-middle-class/) has increased dramatically, and poverty has decreased.\n\nYes, the distribution of wealth is still screwed, but there is vastly more wealth, which is benefiting many poorer countries.\n\n**TL;DR: it was a time of missed opportunities, and some screw ups, but I don't think it was a tipping point as you suggest, and that even had Gore been elected, things wouldn't have been dramatically different.**\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses provided to the original post discussing the perception of the George W. Bush years in history, we need to consider their tone, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, readability, and engagement with the original poster's argument.\n\n### Comparison of Responses:\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- **First Response:** The tone here is somewhat confrontational and skeptical. It implies criticism of the original poster's assertions without fully acknowledging the emotion behind them. The phrases \"What in the world are you talking about?\" and \"Guess who forced mortgage giants...\" indicate a dismissive stance towards the original poster's arguments.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is more measured and respectful. The responder begins by acknowledging the original poster's view and agreeing that Bush was a \"horrible president.\" This approach creates a more collegial atmosphere and invites a constructive dialogue.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- **First Response:** Utilizes a point-by-point rebuttal strategy, attempting to dismantle the original poster's claims systematically. However, its aggressive questioning may alienate the original poster rather than persuade them.\n- **Second Response:** Combines agreement with the original poster on some points with thoughtful counterarguments. It presents a more nuanced view, effectively recognizing the complexity of the Bush presidency while introducing alternative explanations.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- **First Response:** The structure is fragmented with abrupt statements and questions. This could hinder readability and create confusion, making it hard for the reader to follow the logic of the argument.\n- **Second Response:** The response is structured more cohesively and reads like a reflective piece, making it easier for the original poster to digest. Each section flows logically into the next, contributing to overall comprehension.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- **First Response:** While it engages directly with each point made by the original poster, it lacks an empathetic understanding of why the original poster feels strongly about these issues. This may come off as combative, potentially leading the original poster to double down on their viewpoint.\n- **Second Response:** Engages by acknowledging the original poster's emotional investment in their argument, even while challenging their conclusions. By emphasizing that both missed opportunities and the complexities of political leadership matter, it positions itself as a more thoughtful critique.\n\n### Prediction:\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Prediction:\nThe key factor in predicting the successful change of the original poster's view lies in the tone and engagement style of the second response. It presents a balanced critique that respects the original poster's perspective while still introducing counterarguments in a respectful and collegial manner. The acknowledgment of shared beliefs (that Bush was a poor president) ingrains a sense of collaboration rather than hostility, potentially fostering openness to reconsidering the original view. The first response, while factually rigorous, lacks emotional engagement and addresses the original poster's assertions in an aggressive manner that is less likely to lead to a changed perspective.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 2, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:I believe US should spend more money on military.\n\nOriginal Post: \n1. Military industry keeps some of the very few manufacturing jobs in US, this industry's survival critically depends on US's defence policies and government orders, without US spending sizeable chunk of its budget on military, millions of jobs will be lost.\n\n2. US has the money. Yes, US is in some serious debt right now, however USD is the most indestructible currency ever existed in human history, with US's economy size, gold reserve and military power at its back, it is impossible for USD to collapse in the foreseeable future. US can always borrow more money from its own citizen or foreign countries without worrying about crisis like Greece happen. Further more, even if USD value drops as a consequence of US printing more cash to pay back debts, all other countries will follow to de-value their currencies to compete with US, just like we have seen in the past few years.\n\n3. US spending more on military doesn't necessary mean a safer world, but at least it will make its NATO allies safer. As a Canadian I know we don't have to worry about fighting off an invasion alone. US spending more on defence means we will spend less, this will benefit our economy and allow us to put more money into our welfare system.\n \n4. No matter how much US government sets its 'defence' budget,  US's armed force is built to be an offence force. Considering how the military complex works and US politician/public thinks, US will never stop bombing/invading smaller countries to defend its 'freedom'. Spending more money developing and ensuring US's technological advantage on military means less casualties from those inevitable wars.\n\n5. Military technologies benefits civilian life in the long run. We wouldn't get internet, GPS, jumble jets and spacecraft if US haven't thrown so much money into military. I want to see human land on Mars before I am 50, so come on US congress, make it happen!\n\nEdit:\n\nTo answer some of the most frequent questions:\n\n**Why not spend the money on infrastructure/medical research/education/NASA?**\n\nWell, when US was cutting military spending in the 90s, the federal spending on education/infrastructure/NASA/higher education research also went down. I fundamentally disagree the argument that 'we are not spending enough on such/such/such because we spend too much on military!' The fact is the amount we spend on military and other programs is not a zero sum game. Spending less on military dose not bring US better infrastructure/education/research. \n\n**US is already spending too much on military, it's by far the most powerful force in the world, why more?**\n\nIn % per GDP sense, US ranked No.21 in the world(3.5%), behind Saudi Arabia (10.8%), Israel (5.2%) and Russia (4.5%), this is not that much. Comparing to those countries and the collapsed USSR, US is in a much better financial state (see my point 2).\n\nAlso, US government and public have set their military force to be the keeper of freedom/world police ever since the end of WWII. Yes the current size of US military is too big for a defensive force. However, for what US public and government want it to be? I think the current spending is well justified if not insufficient. \n\nFirst Response: \nSo I feel like this is a joke but I can't really tell. Here goes\n\nFirst, pretty much everything you're saying cal already be accomplished by maintaining our extremely high military funding. Here's a point by point response:\n\n1. Sure, but it also creates the military industrial complex. It  creates an incentive to go to war because it's profitable. Killing your own people and other people because you can make money is kinda a bad thing. The US can create jobs plenty of other ways: build infrastructure, invest in green energy, etc. and all of those are pretty harm-free\n\n2. Okay? But we already have a [noticeably stronger military](http://pgpf.org/Chart-Archive/0053_defense-comparison) than anyone else. Just because we *can* spend the money doesn't mean we *should* when it can be spent on [much better things](http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21605932-country-where-everyone-drives-america-has-shoddy-roads-bridging-gap)\n\n3. No, it means we go to war more. Which means we draw NATO allies into war. And we already have a military strong enough to protect our allies. Who in NATO is under any sort of threat right now?\n\n4. How about we just don't go to war in those cases? Increased spending at least makes it more likely that we go to useless wars\n\n5. So fund research, not military research.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou have some arguments for why the US should spend more money in general, and other ones why spending on the military is better.  \n\n1. I think there better ways to support manufacturing jobs than just military spending.  Instead of building a 12th aircraft carrier, the US could spend that money manufacturing more buses or trains to improve US infrastructure.  This also could improve the economy and the quality of life of many Americans by making transportation better and easier.\n\n2. This is an argument for spending money in general, not necessarily on military spending.  The US is concerned about long term debt, and is actively cutting funding from plenty of other programs.  To some extent, there is a limit to what is spent total by the government, and so more military spending inevitably will mean less spending on other programs.  \n\n3. Most Americans will not be terribly motivated to think that their additional military spending will lead to Canadians having richer social programs, especially if it comes with cuts to American social programs.  Additionally, the US military is already overwhelming strong, and more or less spending probably wouldn't impact strength in any meaningful way.  The US spends approximately as much on its military as the rest of the world.  Most of the other top spending countries are allies of the US.  \n4. There are ways to continue high R&amp;D budgets in the military without spending as much.  About $300 billion/~$700 billion of the annually spent military budget is on pay and benefits for soldiers. That means that the US Militiary will spend more in wages and benefits in 2015 than the Canadian government will spend **in total** in 2015.  One of the big reasons for this is that the US military has hundred of thousands of soldiers stationed overseas, including about 60,000 in Germany and 30,000 in Japan, where troops have been stationed since the end of WWII.  \n5. The military isn't the only program the US can spend money on.  They can support NASA, scientific grants, etc, many of which would provide a much better bang for the buck in terms of scientific achievement.  \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$ \n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include the Second Response\u2019s more engaging tone and its reliance on constructive arguing.

{"index": 3, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:I feel uncomfortable with my hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are far from north american culture. You're expected to not reveal too much when dressing. I completely understand that everyone has the right to dress how they want to but I just don't feel like if you are giving yourself to your SO then you shouldn't let others see your body.\n\n To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. Too much cleavage or wearing no bras with thin shirts that let you clearly see the nipple and then she hugs other people makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would love to change my view, as I stand by the right that anyone can wear whatever they want, but this idea is just so integrated in my head after all my life living in it that I can't seem to shut it off\n\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has.\n\nIs this really your motivation, though? The moments you share with yourselves are that much more special if your significant other doesn't wear revealing clothing? Or is this simply what you say to rationalize your uncomfortable feelings to avoid acknowledging that your feelings are your own problem? \n\nIn my experience when talking about this issue and similar ones with others, I find this actually isn't what they mean. What they really mean is they do not want other people looking at their significant other -- not that the time they spend together is actually more special. Really the emotion you are feeling here is one of two things: selfishness or jealousy. \n\nYou are either being selfish in not wanting other people to see your significant other in that light, or you are jealous that other people are able to see her in that way while you are not (at least in those moments). \n\nSo the underlying motivation here is not that you want to preserve some special connection, but rather you want to avoid uncomfortable feelings caused by your selfishness and jealousy. You will still have a special connection, once you get over these feelings, because the special connection you share is not based on something so superficial. \n\nSecond Response: \nOkay OP, I might have an answer for you. If you truly want to change your view it's going to take a while and even then it might still not be fully changed.   \nSo you say you believe that people should be able to wear what they want. That's good, as all people should have that right. Now the biggest issue that you have with it is that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Now I can't make you not feel uncomfortable seeing your hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors, only you can.  \n  \nBeing uncomfortable with what your SO wears I think stems from jealousy. You feel that only you should have the right to see that part of your SO. But that's not how the world works these days. You need to invest some trust into your hypothetical SO and realize that you're the only man she wants to be with. Now why would a person with a SO wear revealing clothing? Because it could just be there style, or it makes the feel good about themselves. But you need to try and not be so possessive of your hypothetical SO, they are a person too and they are going to do what they want. And if you're dating someone you should have enough respect for them to let them wear what they want, because when it comes down to it you don't control their actions.   \n  \n  \nNow to change your feelings, the only solution that I have for you is honestly, to buck up. Changing an opinion that is ingrained into you culture is incredibly hard, but it is possible. I had to change how I felt uncomfortable with wearing certain things or discussing certain topics. And though it felt wrong when I did it, the more I kept at it the less wrong it felt. And about after 4 months I found that my feeling on the matter had changed. So if you want to change how you feel, you have to let your SO wear what they want. And if you don't want to change that's fine, but I personally would find an overly jealous SO to be undesirable.    \n    \nHope that helps!\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response is likely to have had a greater impact on the original poster's view due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Empathy and Personal Experience**: The second response acknowledges the difficulty of changing ingrained feelings and provides a personal anecdote about overcoming similar discomforts. This personal touch creates a sense of solidarity, suggesting that change is possible and relatable.\n\n2. **Constructive Advice**: The second respondent offers specific suggestions for moving forward through the process of change, such as trusting the partner and accepting their autonomy. This direct engagement with the OP's feelings and providing actionable steps is likely to resonate more deeply.\n\n3. **Balanced Tone**: While both responses challenge the OP's views, the second response maintains a more balanced tone. It validates the OP's feelings while gently guiding them toward self-reflection and growth without coming off as accusatory, which can foster openness to change.\n\n4. **Respect for Autonomy**: The focus on the girlfriend's right to wear what she wants encourages a broader perspective on relationships that may encourage the OP to reconsider and evolve their viewpoint over time.\n\nIn contrast, the first response's more confrontational tone and emphasis on selfishness may alienate the OP or elicit defensiveness rather than inspire reflection.

{"index": 4, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: McDonald's was not responsible for the injuries of the lady who spilled coffee over herself\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've seen a few posts lately that refer to the lady who spilled coffee on herself and then sued McDonald's for medical expenses, and I am completely bemused by the support for the lady. \n\nThe jury found McDonald's to be 80% responsible and awarded several million dollars compensation, which was later reduced to about 600 000 dollars, and then later settled.\n\nAcording to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants) and another [website](http://www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm) here are the abridged facts of the incident as I understand them.\n\n* coffee was ordered at a drive through window\n* coffee was handed to Liebeck\n* Liebeck's son drove off\n* they stopped so Liebeck could add sugar\n* Liebeck spilled the entire cup over her lap, hence severely injuring her\n\nMy argument that it is not McDonald's responsibility is that she had been safely handed the coffee. The transaction was complete and she had control. If the coffee had been spilled during the handover I would view it the other way around.\n\nThere are two arguments that I reject. I reject that the severity of the injury affects the responsibility. Comments such as \"have you seen those injuries, they're horrific, she had to be reconstructed\" are common. This is true, they were appalling injuries. But I think this is a strawman argument because my point is that it was not McDonald's responsibility after the handover, not that the injuries were minor. \n\nI reject that the coffee was too hot. These are hot drinks. It's obvious to me, and I would hope anyone who intends to drink such a drink that it would be hot and care should be given. Perhaps my culture views it differently. I grew up in England, and here 9 and ten year olds make tea for themselves; kettles boil water and then that water is poured into a teapot / cup. We know from a young age that this is dangerous and extreme care must be taken when handling such hot water. Indeed, in a similar UK case against McDonald's regarding hot coffee, the judge ruled that McDonald's was not responsible, one of the reasons being that people expect hot drinks to be hot and should make reasonable safety measures themselves. I do not believe Americans don't realise hot water is dangerous.\n\n If anyone would like to comment, I'd be happy to elaborate further. I look forward to having interesting discussion.\n\n**EDIT:** *Thank you for your replies so far, I'm working my way through replying to them.*\n\n**EDIT:** *Thank you for your comments and discussion. I have awarded deltas to comments that highlighted arguments that I had not considered. My view is still that McDonald's were not liable for any costs. I have come to the conclusion that the discrepancy is due to a difference in cultural expectations of temperature of served hot drinks. I was brought up in a culture where water is regularly boiled at home and hence all children learn how to be careful around just-boiled water. As mentioned above, that is part of the reason why an almost identical case was thrown out in the UK.* \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This principle isn't applied in all jurisdictions, but it *is* used in the jurisdiction wherein the incident and the lawsuit took place.   \nAccording to this doctrine the plaintiff can be awarded damages even if they themselves contributed to the damage.    \n    \nSo taking all of the evidence that McDonald's was *to some extent* responsible, they were also to some extent liable.    \n   \nGiven the over-heated coffee they carried some liability; but I think more importantly they intentionally down-played the warning on the coffee cup. That was probably done to make the cup more aesthetically pleasing, but it nonetheless seats them with some responsibility.   \nThey took their own warning to their customers and made it negligible so that the cup would be attractive.    \n   \nI don't think it can be argued that McDonald's carried zero responsibility for the incident and the law in that state makes it clear that they are therefore liable *to some extent*.  \n\nSecond Response: \nAs I see it, you're arguing from the wrong stand point. \n\nYour view is mostly based around the notion that customers should expect a hot drink to be hot, and therefore handle it carefully. This is logical and thus at a first glance seems like an argument in the context of this lawsuit.\n\nHowever, it is irrelevant because it is not mutually exclusive with the notion of serving (easily tippable, might I add) hot drinks that will not cause severe (3rd degree) burns in the event of the cup tipping over. Something we can very easily observe when you look at just about any other establishment that sells coffee.\n\nThe loose thread in your reasoning is as follows: should customers handle hot drinks carefully? Yes. However, should establishments sell hot drinks in handheld, plastic cups that will cause you 3rd degree burns if spilled? No. And the thing is that there is a very extensive middle ground in here, to which all establishments selling this sort of items adhere to.\n\nFor this reason, McDonald's was found liable.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To predict which of the two responses was more effective at changing the original poster's view, we can analyze the tone, rhetorical techniques, and engagement strategies utilized in each response.\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is informative and somewhat accommodating. It seeks to clarify the nuances of the case without dismissing the original poster's perspective outright.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** The response uses legal jargon (e.g., \"Comparative Negligence\") and references specific legal principles that were applied in the case. This adds credibility to the argument but could also alienate readers unfamiliar with legal terms.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The sentences are clear and straightforward, making the response easy to follow despite the complexity of the subject matter.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** It acknowledges the original poster\u2019s points but also counters them with detailed analysis, attempting to address the OP\u2019s understanding of the legal verdict.\n\n**Second Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is somewhat more confrontational, implying that the original poster's argument is fundamentally flawed. It may come off as dismissive rather than engaging.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** This response emphasizes the responsibility of establishments to sell safe products, providing a counterpoint to the original poster\u2019s contention about customer responsibility.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The sentences are longer and contain more complex ideas that can make it slightly harder to parse. However, the argument is laid out logically.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** While it challenges the OP\u2019s reasoning directly, it lacks the tactful acknowledgment found in the first response and does not provide as much room for a constructive conversation.\n\n**Prediction:**\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the first response's balanced approach. It manages to respect the original poster's viewpoint while effectively introducing legal principles that counter the OP's claims. By presenting facts and legal context in an informative manner, it creates a platform for reconsideration of the argument. In contrast, the second response, while valid, adopts a more aggressive stance that could lead to defensive reactions rather than open-mindedness.

{"index": 5, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The only way to change the ignorant is with violence.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.\n\n\nAs I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.\n\n\nI can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. \n\n\nHowever, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.\n\n\nI sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.\n\n\nIgnorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).\n\n\nSo to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV\n\n\nEdit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?\n\nFirst Response: \nLets start with ignorance, because I believe you're not representing it properly, and aren't fully thinking through the implications of what your suggesting.\n\nIgnorance does not stem from closed mindedness, but rather, lack of knowledge. You, and every other human on earth are ignorant about many things in the world. Being ignorant has no effect on your openness to new ideas, in fact, people who are ignorant could be considered a blank slate. Perhaps a better word for this would be inconsiderate or insensitive?\n\n\nBeing closed minded is essentially being resistant to change, and that's not always a bad thing. Skepticism is a healthy thing, and in certain circumstances, it makes sense to adjust your willingness to be persuaded. It is in some ways necessary to our survival, and has been a factor in allowing us to survive this long.\n\n\nAs for punishing ignorance, that's not a proportional response. People's brains are not capable of comprehending everything that's happening in the world, and ignorance is necessary. The weight of all of the suffering, sadness, and tragedy in the world is not something people are equipped to actually all comprehend at once.\n\n\npeoples instincts and emotions do strongly influence them. You're desire to use violence is a perfect example of that. I agree that in our current society, mistreatment of homosexuals is a serious issue, and we should be educating the ignorant, and attempting to persuade the insensitive, but that doesn't mean we should expect ignorance to away completely.\n\nSecond Response: \nSo from what I gather from your story, you wanted these people to be physically punished because they....hurt your feelings? I understand fighting (in a literal sense) for rights and equality under the law, but you aren't entitled to live in a world where people don't judge you. \n\nWhat you consider \"ignorance\" might be completely different from what someone else considers ignorant. A vegan might see meat eaters as being ignorant for causing pain and suffering to animals. But a meat eater may see a vegan as being closed-minded by judging people for the manner in which they obtain a basic human necessity. You can't label a certain opinion (and a group that holds that opinion) as \"ignorant\" and deserving of violence because you simply don't hold the authority to decide which opinions qualify as ignorant. And what about the people who are quietly ignorant? They may not openly laugh at you on the street but they still think of you as scum and spread their agenda. Do they deserve violence too? Even though they've done nothing but have an opinion?\n\nAgain, you do not have the right to live in a world where people don't judge you. But people do have the right to an opinion, and they should not be subject to violent repercussions just because they hold that opinion.\n\nLastly, how do you fix ignorance? That's like asking how do I fix people's opinions who don't agree with mine? You don't. Let them have their shitty opinions, and choose not to give them the time of day.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the tone and emotional approach of the responses, as well as their engagement with the original poster's feelings.

This challenge to the original poster's assumptions could prompt them to reconsider their stance on the justification of violence in response to different opinions.\n\nIn contrast, the first response adopts a more neutral and philosophical tone, focusing on definitions and logical arguments regarding ignorance and closed-mindedness. While it seeks to educate, it may not evoke as strong an emotional reevaluation as the second response does. The second response's direct questioning of the original poster's rationale and the assertion that individuals are entitled to their opinions, regardless of their potential hurtfulness, may resonate more strongly and encourage a deeper reflection on the original poster's beliefs about ignorance and violence.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 6, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Crisis simulations would be better than debates.\n\nOriginal Post: \nSo I saw someone link to [this column](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/want-to-be-president-show-us-how-youd-handle-a-disaster/2015/07/30/00fa4d8e-315c-11e5-97ae-30a30cca95d7_story.html) and thought it was really clever.\n\nI think debates are very poor ways to get useful information about candidates.  If you want hard questioning, or to know their stand on the issues, interviews from journalists can do that.  Debates are just grandstanding and \"gotchas.\"  \n\nA crisis simulation on the other hand would be really useful for getting information about how candidates would do the job of President.  We would see how they asses a situation, how they handle disagreeing advisors, and how deep their knowledge of government runs.\n\nThis is also a technique used in a lot of other situations to train and evaluate people who will hold a lot of responsibility.  If you want to be an astronaut, you're going to be doing a lot of simulations.\n\nAs far as getting candidates to do it, I could see this being something that a somewhat more obscure candidate does as a way to generate publicity, and which might catch on.

I can't see any candidates (except the fringe ones) being masochistic enough for something like this. An additional problem is that since they're on camera, they still wouldn't behave the way they would in a real situation. They know this, and so do we.\n\n* **Reliance on media**\n\nThe WaPo article still stresses that it'll be the journalists who analyze the simulation results for everyone else. How does that remove the ideological bias that's present in the current system? The Democratic supporters would get their analysis from a liberal source, while the Republican supporters would still choose their own source. It's still NPR vs. Fox, just a step removed.\n\n* **Evaluation of successful simulation**\n\nThis is a big one. A lot of these situations would have to deal with emergency scenarios, not long-term matters. So perhaps it would be useful to see how a candidate handles a shooting at an Army base, but it tells us nothing about their ability to negotiate with Iran. It would favour those who can handle emergencies better, while possibly ignoring the more diplomat-type candidates.\n\nThat took a while to write up...\n\nSecond Response: \nThe issue I see is that for the issues a president might face, a simulation won't really help. This is because for the most part it's not a question of \"can the candidate perform a task?\" It's a question of \"what will happen if they do?\" Consider the following possible scenarios:\n\nRepublican and democratic candidates hop into the \"great recession simulator\". Republican candidate responds by cutting taxes and removing regulations. Democrat responds by bailouts and expanding g the safety net. Unless the simulator can actually evaluate the impact those policies, it's no better than a debate question.\n\nThen they hop in the \"Iran is about to get a nuclear bomb\" simulator. They both draft potential agreements to put forth to Iran and other countries. What now? Can the simulator say if that deal will be accepted? Can it evaluate if the deal is enforceable? Again, it's the results that are interesting, and if the simulator can't deliver them it's just an expensive interview question.\n\nMaybe I'm just thinking about this the wrong way though.

{"index": 7, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: A forearm tattoo will not negatively affect prospects for higher education or employment.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe title mentions specifically a tattoo on the forearm, but the underlying premise of my argument is based on a tattoo which would not be visible in formal clothing (such as slacks and a button down) but would be visible in casual wear (shorts and T-shirt). \n\nSuch a tattoo would not affect chances of college acceptance for three reasons; the ubiquity of tattoos amongst college-aged individuals, the relative unimportance of personal image in the college acceptance process, and the low chance of anyone even seeing the tattoo.\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Centre report, nearly 38% of college-aged individuals have a tattoo. While that is not a majority by quite a margin, it is a significant amount. Additionally, the popularity and accessibility of tattoos are steadily increasing year by year leading to a greater acceptance amongst a younger crowd. The point here is that because of their widespread nature, tattoos are no longer seen as a sign of rebellion simply because they are so commonplace. \n\nFurthermore, most colleges prefer to accept or deny students based on their applications alone, rather than on interviews. Unlike a job interview, in which personal image can make or break someone\u2019s chances of getting employment, colleges tend to focus more on scholastic and athletic merit, test scores, and lifetime achievements first. Personal image is last on the docket for a school good enough to conduct personal interviews, if even considered at all. \n\nThe previous two points also assume that a college will know about this tattoo, whereas that may not even be the case. In an interview process, there is no chance that the tattoo will be exposed in formal clothing. If the tattoo is exposed after acceptance, then there is no risk of a college retroactively denying admission based on that alone. \nThis third point is also the keystone argument when it comes to employment. For the sake of this argument, I will assume that if an employer knows about any sort of tattoo, it will result in immediately being passed over for the job. This is not consistent with reality and the first two points I make concerning college can be applied to employment as well; tattoos are slowly gaining acceptance in the workforce as the 38% of college students with tattoos graduate and seek employment, and that employers will seek to hire the most qualified candidate with less emphasis placed on personal image. But even discarding these arguments, the possibility of an employer finding out about a tattoo covered by conservative formal clothing in professional situations is nil. \n\n(As some of you may have guessed, I have posted this because I am considering getting a tattoo and want to make an informed decision before doing so. I think I have carefully considered most ways that a tattoo could impact my life, but I wanted to hear some opposing arguments I may have overlooked and figured Reddit could help me out here) \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For instance I met a member of an accounting firm (I'm an accounting major) at a baseball game and got offered an interview. There was also a \"meet the firms\" night at a restaurant near campus that I accidentally stumbled upon and met many job prospects there.\nAlso, during my internship, we participated in some outdoor activities after work, like playing kickball with the employees, which helped you meet other people at your firm and helped make a good impression. \n\nMy point is that you can't always rely on covering up a tattoo because sometimes you run into job opportunities or situations unexpectedly. Of course this only really applies if your tattoo is obscene or offensive, because most employers could care less if you have a tattoo as long as it isn't like, on your face or something.\n\nSecond Response: \nSome firms don't like their employees having tattoos and they do discriminate. You say you don't think an employer will find out if you dress professionally. So clearly you think a tattoo puts you at a disadvantage. While for most good jobs employers will tend to go for the applicant with the best qualifications and experience. You should remember that usually there is no clear best candidate so a tattoo can make a difference.

Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.\n\nI consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.\n\nThe extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.\n\nIt seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nCould that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee?

{"index": 9, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I believe a Palestine state should be established in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe state of Palestine has 4 million people residing within Isreal. The West Bank and Gaza strip together have 6,000 square kilometers of land. The North Sinai Governorate alone has 27,000 square Kilometers of land, that's more land than even Isreal has (22,000 sq km).\n\n[Here is what a State of Palestine could look like on a map, either with only the Northern part or the full peninsula.](http://sinaimaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/governorates-sinai-egypt.jpg)\n\nOne could argue that the Sinai Peninsula is mostly desert and unfit for people to live in, but Israel was mostly desert when they began immigrating to the region too. Irrigation, agriculture, forestry, and artificial canals have been known to combat or reverse desertification.\n\nThe people already residing there can be promised equal citizenship rights in the new state of Palestine. Egypt could even allow for the people there to have duel citizenship, so that they can choose to either stay in the new state or easily move to inland Egypt. If necessary, Egypt could offer incentives for Sinai people to move inland prior to the establishment of the state.\n\nIf a \"buffer\" line/zone were felt to be necessary, it could be jointly run by Israel and Egypt stationed outside the borders without much issue from the Palestinians. The U.N. Security council could send peacekeepers to the peninsula to monitor the region's development. There would be very little reason for any of the Security members to veto this decision if Egypt, Israel, and Palestine all agreed to this.\n\nAlbeit, it's extremely unlikely this will ever happen, but I think it would be a good solution. Which is why I'm here, what is wrong with this plan?\n\n**Edit:** Added what can happen with the people already living there.\n\nFirst Response: \n1) What do you propose is done with the West Bank?\n\n2) Even ignoring the difficulty of actually growing crops in the Sinai, Israeli efforts to reduce desertification were possible only due to large amounts of foreign funds and resources that poured into the state after its foundation. The Palestinian diaspora has no such source of funding, hence it is doubtful that they would be able to actually water in a climate that is even more harsh than Israel's is, on average.\n\n3) Israel is generally thought of as being one of the most over-populated areas in the world, relative to it's carrying capacity. It is possible that global warming will exacerbate the issue along with the changing climate, and this would also likely apply to the Palestinian Sinai.\n\n4) Egypt won't sign on to it because it weakens their hold over the Suez Canal by putting a foreign nation on the other bank pretty close to the canal.\n\n5) Palestine won't sign on to it because, let's face it, they just won't. You're implicitly saying that the Palestinians should be forced to move out of their present lands for no reason other than their own ethnicity.\n\n6) Israel won't sign on to it because lately the Israeli government has been against the establishment of any Arab Palestinian government in the region.\n\nSecond Response: \nOne basic way of refuting this idea is by simply looking at the current situation in the Sinai Peninsula. \n\n\n\nFirst, the region has always been populated by people. The native bedouin people have lived in that region far longer than you seem to be giving them credit for. Most of them migrated there between 1300 and 1700. Quite a long time for a place that so inhospitable. \n\nAlso, Israel might have been \"mostly dessert\" but the whole reason we need a Palestine state is because of the millions of people the Israel state forced into refugee status by making them leave. It might have been mostly dessert, but damn, it was home to a lot of people. \n\nEgypt certainly could offer the things you mentioned to the Bedouin people. Egypt has abjectly refused to do so, and has created a terrible caste system whereby terrorist groups have thrived in the region, so I do not see this happening anytime soon. But sure, in a perfect world, that could theoretically happen. (Are you familiar at all with what is going on in this region??, are we talking about the same Egypt, the northern Africa country that has gone through three leaders in the past five years? The one with the pyramids?)\n\nI'm not even sure I want to talk about a buffer zone right now. Its late, and the current buffer zone is being executed so terribly and horrendously right now that I do not think that term should be uttered in geopolitical conversations concerning this region. \n\nI guess more than anything I am confused by your view prompt. Are you saying that if the things you mentioned happened that a Palestine state could thrive? \n\nI mean if the planets align and ponies sprout wings with rainbows coming out their butts, then yea sure this might happen. I would rather you suggest Utah as a solution, or maybe suggest building an island in the middle of the ocean out of old two litter bottles of soda.

It presents counterarguments in a methodical and structured way without overt emotional language. This might make it seem less engaging to an emotional appeal.\n- **Second Response:** The second response has a more conversational and sarcastic tone, particularly towards the end.

Also it depends on the time period and that state of the nation or federation. As an American who isnt a socialist country 90% tax rates pulled us out of our great depression. High taxes helped us after WWII I believe as well. In history high tax systems can work, you could argue in difficult economic circumstances only. \n\n&gt;My hypothesis is that extreme racial/cultural difference (Skin Color, Mutually Exclusive Religion, Colonial Grievances, etc.) between populations leads to self-segregation, behind-the-back othering/scapegoating, and lower interpersonal trust on average\n\nWell your society and any society with heavy diversity will definitely face varying levels of these problems no matter what type of institutions are used. Humans naturally like to put things in mental categories, so with all forms of diversity someone is facing unequal adversity at somepoint.\n\n&gt;- the foundation for a socialistic society where all are to be treated equally. You might be willing to do business with the other group, but god forbid your family invite them over or get intimate with them. As long as visibly different groups with past antagonisms exist, people will judge members of the other group differently, at least with no other information available. \n\nDemocracy, Communism, Socialism, and a Republic all promote unity and equality amomg the masses on paper. As of so far it has been impossible to literally replicate a perfect form of any of these. They are all amended specifically to a country or region that doesn't cause war or they are fighting to change the foundations.\n\n&gt;I suspect the primary reason right-wing parties against the EU and Social Democracy are on the rise, is due to lower interpersonal trust brought on by 1.) The Continuing Employment Slump and 2.) Immigration, particularly from Africa and the Muslim world. \n\nWell when taking the public opinion during bad times will always get a bad rating, with people questioning the current system more often. Just as the opposite would occur during good times, socially or \neconomically.\n\n&gt;the economy continues to slug along in the midst of austerity, the natives are feeling a tad powerless, with the lower classes having to compete now with immigrant labor - leading to scapegoating and resentment.\n\nThis is the same way the public felt in America around our last major depression. Statistically deeper the recession or depression the greater levels of prosperity and recovery follow in the last century or so at least.\n\n&gt; This is not a new phenomenon - the entire history of the industrial age is replete with labor-fueled resentment from the lower-class establishment toward foreigners trying to take their place. \n\nYour counter arguement is the main point, this is not a new phenomenon and its not a non common one. It also certainly is not specfic to any one form of government, or party, or even social group. Even American politics are starting to open up to socialism and we seem to be dropping the negative meaning more.\n\n&gt;Please change my view. I'm open to your ideas.\n\nSorry I dont have the knowledge to provide sufficant examples of socialist life. My arguement is simply the problems you are identifying in socialism exist in all forms. I hope I helped give a point of view you didn't previously consider.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe amount of social services and socialism is much more strongly equated with the wealth of a country than with its diversity. An ethnically diverse state such as Belgium is much more socialist than Bangladesh, which is 98.5% ethnically Bengali. The Nordic countries are socialist because they are rich. \n\nImmigrants do not prevent socialism either. Just look as how Canada is far more socialist the the USA despite the fact that it has a much larger amount of immigrants. Burundi, which receives almost no immigrants, is very non-socialist.\n\nThe rise of right-wing parties is essentially the rise of a scapegoating philosophy which blames the country's woes on immigrants. However, in times of economic depravity there will almost always be a scapegoat of some sort. People do not like the idea that everyone is personally, equally responsible for bad economic times, or that it is just random. Sometimes that scapegoat will be the rich, other times it will be immigrants, or corporations, or the government. \n\nThe reason immigrants are selected as the scapegoat is multifaceted. \n\n1. They are unable to vote, making them an easy target for politicians\n2. They are less relatable because of their cultural differences\n3. They have an advantage in that they are more economically efficient (work for less pay, work harder).\n\nThe point I am trying to make is that societies can be diverse without being hateful, and that immigrants are unjustly blamed for economic woes which are not their fault. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor in predicting which response changed the original poster's view centers on how effectively each response engaged with the original post's arguments and underlying assumptions. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains an informative and somewhat assertive tone. It presents factual contrasts and examples (like Canada vs. the USA) to directly tackle the original poster\u2019s argument that diversity undermines socialism. In contrast, the first response is more cautious and somewhat apologetic, failing to present a compelling counter-narrative to the original post's thesis.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs comparative analysis, contrasting the social outcomes of different countries based on their wealth rather than their diversity. This is an effective rhetorical technique that directly challenges the poster\u2019s view, providing a broader context that showcases the complexity of the relationship between diversity and socialism. The first response makes observations but lacks this broader analysis, thus failing to strongly engage the original poster's conclusions.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response is structured in a clear, digestible manner. It utilizes numbered points to ensure clarity, aiding comprehension and retention of key arguments. The first response, while detailed, is less coherent, with run-on sentences that may hinder understanding.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response engages deeply with specific points made by the original poster, systematically dismantling the fear of diversity as a barrier to socialism. It presents a thoughtful critique that encourages consideration of different viewpoints. In contrast, the first response acknowledges points but becomes more theoretical, which may not be as persuasive in changing the original poster's mind.\n\nUltimately, the second response\u2019s reliance on factual examples, clear structure, and assertive engagement make it more likely to shift the original poster\u2019s perspective on the relationship between socialism and diversity.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 11, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:I feel uncomfortable with my hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are far from north american culture. You're expected to not reveal too much when dressing. I completely understand that everyone has the right to dress how they want to but I just don't feel like if you are giving yourself to your SO then you shouldn't let others see your body.\n\n To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. Too much cleavage or wearing no bras with thin shirts that let you clearly see the nipple and then she hugs other people makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would love to change my view, as I stand by the right that anyone can wear whatever they want, but this idea is just so integrated in my head after all my life living in it that I can't seem to shut it off\n\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. \n\nThat ship has sailed. You're likely male, and as such, have viewed nude images of women online. You probably have seen many nude images. You're not giving your SO something unique, you've looked at numerous women and will likely compare your SO to such women. When this is the thousandth body you've explored then the specialness somewhat wears off.\n\nExtra specialness, which you generally can't get online, comes from your emotional connection, attraction, and desire for each other. \n\nShe, biologically, likely has a body similar to many of the women you've seen online and many men have likely imagined having sex with her and imagined her body, with moderate accuracy, regardless of her clothing. \n\nA good relationship comes from emotional connections which are often aided by your partner being hot and smelling nice and tasting good and having a pretty voice. When you accept each other and all your flaws, when you have ways to avoid fights, when you know how to touch each other properly, stuff like that. Bar your girlfriend secretly being some kind of alien human hybrid, you've seen a lot of women like her naked, she's probably seen a lot of men like you naked, your physical attire is going to have little impact on your relationship.\n\nSecond Response: \nI'm from the US. The big stereotype of Americans is that we are very prideful. This is accurate for a large portion of the population.\n\nNow, my personal view on this doesn't really apply as my wife and I have an open relationship. Most couples, however, have this view of showing off their girlfriend or wife. \"This hot girl right here? She's mine. Look at what I have that you can't. This makes me better than you.\" (This is a little bit exaggerated to make my point, but is essentially accurate.)\n\nWomen also tend to find it empowering. Some of the women I've encountered who find it empowering believe this makes them more powerful than the men they attract as it does affect how men interact with them and tends to make the men want to do things for the women wearing revealing clothing.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are primarily based on the emotional engagement and the angle of empowerment presented in the Second Response. Unlike the First Response, which predominantly focuses on the idea that revealing clothing diminishes the specialness of a relationship through comparisons to outside stimuli (e.g., other women's nude images), the Second Response addresses the dynamics of power and ownership in relationships. This perspective may resonate more with the original poster, as it not only acknowledges their feelings but also reframes the idea of revealing clothing in a positive, empowering light for both partners.\n\nAdditionally, the tone in the Second Response is somewhat more personal and relatable, as it includes the responder's own experience with open relationships and hints at the societal pressures regarding relationships and attraction. This could foster a sense of understanding and acceptance, initiating a dialogue that encourages the original poster to consider a broader viewpoint regarding clothing and relationship dynamics. The First Response, while analytical, lacks a personal touch and may come off as more confrontational, possibly alienating the original poster rather than persuading them to change their perspective.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 12, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The United States lost World War II\n\nOriginal Post: \nI believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.\n\nI am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.\n\nContrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.\n\nWhat really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?\n\nSorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The U.S. became one of 2 superpowers after WWII. After outlasting the USSR, America is now the only superpower. While this may bring the country into certain conflicts, it has enabled America to become the biggest player in world affairs. The amount of influence America can exert, whether that's been used for good or bad purposes, is incredible.\n\n2. You mention the U.S. military presence doesn't breed goodwill, but I think you've isolated certain regions in a certain time period. Most recently, a U.S. convoy was [welcomed with open arms] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/politics/army-convoy-through-europe/) during its trek across Europe. Additionally, the U.S. military, (especially the navy) is central to many humanitarian relief efforts. Here's one [example.] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/14/us-military-relief-philippines_n_4277471.html)\n\n3. Lastly, I don't think universal healthcare should be the measuring point for whether or not a nation succeeded in \"winning\" WWII.

If we go by raw numbers, Hillary will most likely win the next election. This got me thinking.\n\nDemographics are changing in America. Firstly, Non-whites become a higher percent of the US population seemingly every year. This could be for a number of reasons, like immigration, but it's a good thing for the democrats because non-whites are statistically more likely to be liberal. I don't see this trend changing so I have a hard time seeing how the a Conservative will be voted into office again. \n\nSecondly, Conservatives are aging. Statistically, older people are typically more conservative whereas younger people are typically more liberal. The older Conservatives will eventually all die and be replaced by young liberals. \n\nI must be overlooking something, or missing some way that Conservatives can get votes in the future. Has a situation like this happened before? \n\nedit: view is changed\n\nFirst Response: \nThe flaw in your thinking is that people don't change their beliefs over time.  You know all of those \"old Conservatives\" that are starting to die off?  They were bra-burning, free-loving, pot-smoking hippies in the 1960s.  They were \"young liberals.\"  \n\nIt isn't that conservatism was popular in 50 years ago and now it's been replaced with liberalism.

These are very different things.\n\nSecond Response: \nPublic opinion can shift, but so can the Republican party.  If Republicans start losing big-time, the platforms of its candidates will shift.\n\nBut Republicans *are* winning elections. Republicans hold the House (by a wide margin) and the Senate.  There are way more Republican governors than Democrats. \n\nAdditionally, how people vote in election depends on a lot more than the views the candidates hold.  The overall assessment of how the country is doing, especially its economy, is a huge factor.  If everything is going well, incumbents (and the incumbent party) get a boost.  If not, incumbents (and the incumbent party) are hurt.  You can see this with the House and Senate.  During and shortly after the end of the unpopular Bush presidency, the House and Senate were solidly Democrat.  But as the economy continued to slump under Obama, they've both gone back to solidly Republican.  People's opinions didn't drastically change in that time.

However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is *cultural influence*. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole *idea* of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably.\n\nHowever, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation. Heck, even Japanese bands are some of the most globally popular Eastern bands (though South Korea might take the crown with regards to this one after PSY).\n\nThe point I'm making is that apart from cuisine, I cannot see of any real cultural impact Chinese culture has had on the rest of the world, especially when compared to the influences of Western culture as well as Korean and Japanese culture. Because of this, I find it hard to take China seriously as a social threat, although politically and economically I accept that they are strong.\n\nFirst Response: \nI think you are correct that one of the elements to international power and prestige is cultural influence. Every great power needs to have both to get into the game. Culture writ large is not just media or fashion. But scientific and artistic. Germany never rose to the poison as premier country in Europe even though it had immense economic, military and cultural power and prestige in the late 19th and 20th centuries. It's cultural import was the equal or greater than that of its rivals.  China does not have the mass cultural influence of Japan or even Korea. It's best students seek to learn abroad, and many stay abroad. The biggest impediment to China's rise as a cultural power is the lack of political freedom. You could say that European counties achieved cultural hegemony with limited democracy, but all the counties were limited in their freedom at the time. China needs to compete on a cultural level with one hand tied behind its back. It's economy which is open in some ways but still directed and controlled in many important ways. The problem is that communist party can not open itself up politically without endangering it's own survival. The wealth that party members and their families have amassed is based on political connections and state controls that would be under pressure from a political opening. \n\nBut if China were able to open itself up politically the cultural flood gates would open dramatically. China's history shows that for the vast majority of its history it has proven to be able to be a cultural hegemon, through art and science. It's enormous market alone will prove to develop its own world beating cultures. But here is the biggest problem. Even if China undergoes democratization, their best and brightness may not want to live there because of environmental issues and quality of life, not for quite some times. The best will leave for America. \n\nSecond Response: \nI'm not going to try to convince you but maybe put some things in perspective.\n\nI don't think anyone is truly qualified enough to be able to convince you. But here's my two cents anyhow.\n\nI believe this subject is more complicated than it seems because historical evidence doesn't really count here. I say that mainly due to the fact that we have the internet. Just this alone and the fact that technology is improving at such a fast pace. Makes any kind of prediction really impossible. \n\nEconomically speaking China and America need each other as of right now. China has artificially suppressed their currency in order for them to remain cheap so that they can remain the worlds biggest supplier. This is very important to them as any increase in currency value could cause millions to lose jobs due to (shipping + manufacturing costs &gt; producing locally). They have been using america for that as mentioned by other users, by buying american treasury bills and printing more yuan to dilute their economy. I personally feel this has contributed a lot to the 'dying middle class' heard a lot in america. After all isn't this kind of similar to a time when walmart was on the rise and wrecking small businesses? I don't know where to classify this but it does seem like this is causing a lot of distress in America and if this isn't one way China is influencing things in the america I don't know what is. That being said I may be wrong since I'm no cultural expert. \n\nThen again I have alternate theories on how China might also dominate through the mobile markets. Recently Mediatek(China) has produced some android chips that are beating Qualcomm in terms of the size of their chip. Don't want to go to technical details but (smaller chipset= lower power consumption for same tasks on mobile devices). Maybe they might start flooding the US markets with their cheap but value for money mobile devices. We never know With the internet could happen faster than we think and that would give them some kind of influence right? Considering the amount of time we spend on our mobile devices these days.\n\nI also believe that this cultural advantage america still maintains is due to the leading of the mobile industry by Steve jobs. If China had been the first to develop and market the smartphone well. The world might have been very different. So maybe they invent something that the whole world adopts.\n\nAll these are random speculations. But hopefully gave you some new perspective. If I'm wrong about any facts do tell. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is analytical and somewhat formal, presenting a structured argument.

The numbers get a little more equitable when we account for property crimes where men only outnumber women 2:1. However, white collar crimes, blue collar crimes, violent crimes, sexual crimes, etc. are so vastly male-centric that the numbers increase that much. They are both the overwhelming amount of perpetrators and victimized, though women are victimized significantly, as you'd expect, in intimate crimes and sex-related offenses. \n\nAside from criminality, men are also more likely to be impulsive and aggressive which is likely to eliminate cohesion and cause undue caution due to the erratic, unpredictably violent and harmful action of this sub-group. \n\nWhy does this persist? Why are men so much more criminal and violent? Does this have a tangibly negative effect on society?\n\n_____________________\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

If you define the term such that \"less crime\" = \"more cohesion\", then sure. But I don't think anyone disagrees with such an obvious point; we all agree that men commit more crime.\n\nIf you define it in any way that doesn't make your view painfully obvious, then I'm not so sure. Basically what you're saying is \"any group with an above average crime rate is detrimental to social cohesion\". Well, that would imply the populous of California and Texas are all detrimental to social cohesion, since they have above average crime rates. However, I doubt anyone would agree with such a notion, unless you define social cohesion in a weird way.\n\nI mean, let's think about the logic you're using and apply it to other groups. People aged 18-65 also have an above average crime rate when compared to the general population. Does that mean people of this age are detrimental to social cohesion? Again, probably not, unless you define \"social cohesion\" very strangely.\n\nClearly then, the fact that group X commits a majority of crime is not sufficient evidence to suggest that group X is a detriment to social cohesion.\n\nSecond Response: \nLets look at groups of women - blondes, brunettes, red-heads, etc.  Imagine the crime rate for each group.  If nothing else, due to statistical noise, one group will have a higher per-capita crime rate than another.\n\nLet's say it's brunettes - that is, brunette women are more likely to commit crimes than women with any other hair color.  Does that mean that brunettes are a detriment to social cohesion?\n\nThe flaw in that reasoning is that most women (and most men) do not commit crimes.

{"index": 16, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: White North American Jews have an irrational persecution complex\n\nOriginal Post: \nGrowing up Jewish in Canada, I was taught that Jews are always under threat of extermination - whether by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Persians, and more recently the Nazis. While fear of extermination would indeed be justified in 1930s Europe, fear of extermination by Islamic terrorists continues today even in Canada and the US. I've even heard that ISIS is going to exterminate the Jews, even though ISIS has not killed a single Jewish person to this date.\n\nThere is a widely-held view in Jewish circles that the UN is inherently anti-Semitic even though the majority of permanent members of the UN Security Council are very pro-Israel. UN troops never interfere with Israeli military operations and one of the first UN resolutions was the establishment of the State of Israel. Still, extremist groups like the JDL (Jewish Defence League) attract support from mainstream Jewish organizations, despite their classification as a terrorist group.\n\nThe Jewish community seems to think that their politicians at home persecute them as well. I know so many liberal Jews who will vote for a right-wing party just because they scream their unwavering support for Israel the loudest. Currently, every single major candidate running for President of the United States or Prime Minister of Canada has declared their staunch support for Israel; even left-wingers like Bernie Sanders and Canada's frontrunner Tom Mulcair.\n\nMeanwhile, white cops are killing black kids at a horrifying rate but the Jewish community is still focused on their own supposed persecution. When the Charleston shooting broke out, my synagogue had one moment of silence then continued with its Israel fundraiser. My theory is that North American Jewish culture has developed an irrational persecution complex due to past persecution ritualistically retold every Hanukkah, Passover, Purim, Yom Ha'Shoah, etc. I realize this may come off as anti-Semetic and indeed my own family has called me a \"self-hating Jew\", although I think this only reinforces my point. Will someone change my view?\n\nFirst Response: \nYou have to remember that many Jews alive today were actively persecuted and discriminated against in North America. By chance I just just finished reading an article about Jon Stewart where he describes being bullied for his religion as a child. Clubs still excluded Jewish members and Jews were still treated as very much separate from the rest of society. People who grew up in the 50s, 60s and 70s still faced a fair amount of discrimination as children and younger adults and it's not unreasonable to be affected by that. That makes feelings of persecution entirely rational.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou've developed a theory based on your own family and community, and anecdotes from some national figures and events. But the question is, does the theory represent the majority of North American Jews.\n\nIn my experience it does not, and I also see plenty of national figures that support my position, such as for example [Chomky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky#Political_views), Jon Stewart, [Schulman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Schulman#Activism), etc.; Jews are very active in the BDS movement; and there is of course [J Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_Street) and so forth.\n\nWhy is your experience different from mine? Well, you mentioned \"my synagogue.\" It is very possible that your theory is right about more religious Jews, but a lot of Jews in the US are non-religious and never or almost never go to a synagogue. They are also much less supportive of Israel and far less likely to think Jews are persecuted.\n\nYou might be right that the Jewish **religion** focuses a lot on persecution of Jews (which makes sense, it's how Jews survived), but it simply is [not a big factor in the lives of many or most Jews in North America today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews#Observances_and_engagement): Even of Jews that consider themselves \"strongly connected\" to the Jewish religion, less than half belong to a synagogue.

{"index": 17, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Laws requiring paid maternity leave, in the absence of also requiring paternity leave, would be harmful to women especially those who don't want kids\n\nOriginal Post: \nSo, first and foremost, I think it's unfortunate that the U.S. is one of the countries where both maternity leave and paternity leave are not universally granted by employers. But I think that if we were to put a place a law mandating employers to give paid maternity leave, it would result in unfair hiring biases against women. Some employers would develop a preference for hiring men over women because, if you are purely concerned with profit as lots of employers are, why take the risk of hiring a lady who might take a lot of time from work while you can just not risk it and hire a man? There are already a lot of stereotypes about women being less dedicated to their jobs than men because they are \"more focused on kids\". Wouldn't a mandatory maternity leave just make this worse? \n\nIt's particularly unfair to women who aren't planning on having kids because employers could be biased against them for expecting them to use something they won't ever even need in the first place!\n\nIf paternity leave were also mandated, then this would be less of a problem because men would be as likely (or nearly as likely) to take leave as well, making the \"expected value\" of a man's labor to an employer the same as a woman's, and hopefully eliminating the bias.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There's not much way around it. In the event where the government pays most of the salary while on leave, I don't think hiring practice would change much. \n\nSecondly, I agree that paid paternity leave should also be an option in the event of a mandatory paid maternity leave, if only for the sake of equality. However, I don't think this will change the current hiring practices, simply because I believe males will be less likely to take these leaves than women. \n\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nWhile perhaps in a world where everyone made decisions based on pure rational thinking, this might be true, I don't think this would be an issue in the real world, for two main reasons (both of which are based in current popular perceptions):\n\n1.  As /u/Madplato mentioned, employers are often already biased against hiring women because of the perception that they will probably get pregnant at some point and take off from work.  I don't think requiring employers to pay for the maternity leave would much affect this perception, because I doubt employers will seriously think women who otherwise wouldn't have gotten pregnant and taken time off anyway will now decide to do so just for a few months' pay.  This negative perception of women already unfairly affects women who don't intend to have children.\n\n2.  Employers often already have a perception that men will be more dedicated workers, whether or not you have paid maternity leave, or paid leave for both parents; there's an expectation that men will take less time off for any family-related reason than women.  So I think even if a law requiring paid maternity leave did harm women, adding paid paternity leave wouldn't fix that, because the underlying assumptions about men and women wouldn't change.\n\nFinally, I would say that even taking into account a small chance that employers will discriminate against women more if required to pay for maternity leave, it would still do more good than harm to women workers on the whole.  Not being able to take any time off work to recover from pregnancy and spend quality time with your baby can be a huge source of pressure for women, and can force women to put off having children until later than they would want.  All of these factors harm women.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more empathetic tone towards the original poster\u2019s concern about women and hiring biases, while also acknowledging the complexities of the issue.

I see no issue with there being an option to have the headlights on when the car is off, but I feel that the \"auto\" mode (headlights on when car is on, headlights off when car is off) should be at least as accessible as the always-on mode in all vehicles that have both.\n\nDeltas:\n\n* [Always-on behavior in addition to auto-off behavior](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ffta7/cmv_auto_manufacturers_should_make_their_vehicles/cto7tnn?context=1)\n* [Headlights on a timer](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ffta7/cmv_auto_manufacturers_should_make_their_vehicles/cto8c9k?context=3)\n* [Stopping on the side of a country road in low visibility conditions](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3ffta7/cmv_auto_manufacturers_should_make_their_vehicles/cto8zsu?context=3)\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This saves your battery in the most common case. \n- But, if the key is turned to ACC (accessories powered, radio and windows work, motor is off), the headlights will remain on. This must be intentional, since you must leave the key in the ignition. \n- If the headlight switch is set to parking/\"driving\" lamp mode (dimmer indicator lights only, *illegal* to use at any time while the vehicle is moving), the parking lights will remain on when the car is fully off/key removed. This lets you leave lower wattage lights on for visibility, and should never be something you drive with and then forget, since it's illegal to drive with these lights on. \n\n\nSecond Response: \nI drive an 06 Fusion.\n\nI have a dial to the left of my steering wheel to control the headlight behaviour.  \n\nIf I leave 'em in auto they turn off about 30 seconds after the engine turns off.  I can turn the dial to drive in the dark, or turn them on when the car is off.\n\nSeems like the best solution.

You are suggesting that countries opt in.  This method - while more civil and required by our modern day, global society - is unlikely to bear fruit.\n\n&gt;  The main counter arguement I see against an united Europe is cultural decay or incompatibility, but I do not understand how it would get in the way too much. \n\n**Language**: [Europe has many languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Europe).  This is an especially large problem when dealing with the law where interpretation of a given case, statement or law is the difference between success and failure.  So if only for the most basic reasons, if you have one country, you need one language to be the primary one.  Which one would it be?  \n\n**Social programs**: Any standard that any country currently set for their social programs is a carefully calibrated balance between what they're willing to spend and who they will spend it on. This means that once the countries are united, *everyone* needs to eliminate their social programs and start over with a much larger country in mind.  This will be *fantastic* for the poor countries that have little to no social safety net.  But this will mean that the bar will be significantly lowered for more lucrative countries.  \n\n**Political Parties**: Each country has it's own political preference.  But more than that, the political systems are not even set up to mean the same things.  So to me, the French Socialist party might seem a lot like the Swedish Social Democrats, but they might be vastly different.  Or the current prime minister of Finland is of the National Coalition Party\t, but outside of Finland, it doesn't really exist.  The point that I'm making is that there is no way for anyone to feel represented in government if they will almost certainly have to give up the type of leadership that they voted for and want.\n\nI could go on, but the picture looks the same across the board.  Any country with something to lose wouldn't want to lose it.  Instead, a separate union similar to the European Union makes sense.  EU has their standards for grouping countries and after the third bailout with Greece, it's unlikely that they will be changing their minds.  So, a separate union for smaller countries would be an incredible point of financial leverage.

They are real issues that need to be addressed, and as much as governments like to talk about the middle class, they aren't doing much that actually helps them.\n\nThe inflation: Middle class families used to live in 2-4 bedroom 1-2 bath bungalows in the suburbs or small towns. Quite often siblings would share a bedroom, there would be fights over who got to shower first because there was only one shower and a finite amount of hot water. You packed a sandwich for lunch, dad drove the one car the family owned and would own for the next 10 years to work and mom walked or took transit if available. Clothing was handed down to younger siblings or cousins, there was one modestly sized TV in the house, and when families got a computer it was for the entire family to share. Vacations where often to go camping somewhere which would involve tents and no electricity, not 50' trailers with full kitchens, bathrooms and wifi, and if you were to go on a trip to another country or something, it was something the family saved up for and didn't happen every year. If something was broken, you fixed it instead of throwing it out and buying three more. \n\nWhile all of that might sound like it came out of Leave it to Beaver or The Brady Bunch, I grew up in the 90's. \n\nNow, \"middle class\" people are shopping for luxury/designer brand clothing, cars, and other goods. It's practically considered child abuse to suggest that kids share a bedroom or don't have their own computer, tablet, and phone, and there is no way they would wear clothing handed down or two years old. Suburban/small town homes are multi level McMansions with granite counter tops, stainless steel appliances, multiple big screen tvs, and master bathrooms with Jacuzzi tubs and rain showers. The family car is two or three cars, potentially more if there kids old enough to drive at home, and instead of the kids going for a weekend at grandma's while the parents drive three hours away for a vacation where they stay in a motel and go out for a nice dinner, the whole family flies to an all inclusive resort in another country. \n\nYes, many of those things are cheaper than they once were, but many of them would have been considered luxuries or unattainable a generation ago and that would have been perfectly acceptable. Instead we lament the decline of the \"middle class\" while we continue to inflate what a middle class lifestyle is supposed to look like. \n\n**tl;dr the \"middle class\" is shrinking because what used to be defined as middle class would currently be considered below it, and what is currently \"middle\" class would have been upper-middle to \"rich\" in the past. Instead of lamenting the decline of the middle class we should reevaluate how we define it. CMV** \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Since it has to do with lifestyle change, rather than income I think it should be okay if we begin with a definition of middle class that isn't the standard 35K-100K household income. There are better ways to define middle class, that seem more statistically accurate. [Pew defined middle class households as those earning 67%-200% of a state's median income.](http://www.businessinsider.com/middle-class-in-every-us-state-2015-4), and that's what I'll use. But I'd like to discuss it in general, rather than get into every state's median income. In 2012, the US median household income [was almost the same as in 1990](http://www.statista.com/statistics/200838/median-household-income-in-the-united-states/).\n\nSo if median household incomes haven't risen, what's happening? In my opinion, the lifestyle change has a lot to with the fact that more and more parents delay having children than in the past, and they have fewer children too. \n\n&gt; [The decline in U.S. fertility has been driven primarily by a trend among young adults to postpone having children. Forty years ago, birth rates among women in their 20s were significantly higher than those of women in their 30s. In 1970, there were 168 births per 1,000 women ages 20 to 24, compared with 73 births per 1,000 women ages 30 to 34. However, this gap has steadily narrowed over time. By 2009\u2014for the first time in U.S. history\u2014birth rates among women ages 30 to 34 (97.5 births per 1,000 women) exceeded those for women ages 20 to 24 (96 births per 1,000 women). In 2010, the birth rate among teens dropped to 34 births per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19\u2014the lowest level ever recorded in the United States.](http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-us-population.aspx)\n\nMore parents take the time establish their careers before they have children than in the past. The stability and increased income from a more stable career let them provide a very different lifestyle for their children. So more money is available for fewer children - that's your answer.\n\nEdit: Noticed your username. [Here are some Canadian statistics](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/84f0210x/2008000/ct002-eng.htm) regarding my theory. It still holds up!\n\nSecond Response: \nYou seem to have a weird definition of middle class.\n\nHumans always relate their situation to others, not on an absolute scale. By your way of thinking *no one* was \"middle class\" 100 years ago, even the very rich, and that's just kind of absurd.\n\nMiddle class pretty much by definition means \"near the median\" (or to a lesser degree the mean). Income distribution is just about the *only* thing that matters to whether the middle class is shrinking or growing. If most people are at the top and bottom, then the middle will be small. \n\nThat's what \"middle\" means. It's not a definition of a particular standard of living. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The First Response adopts a more respectful and thoughtful tone, acknowledging the original post and providing a structured argument.

{"index": 23, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I believe the purpose of the military is totally to kill people and break things.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI heard Mike Huckabee say this during the first Republican Debate, and until I went online the next morning, I couldn't imagine anyone would disagree with him. People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.\n\nI think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.\n\nAgain, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. \"Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!\" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. \"The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!\" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.\n\nThe US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things.

Today, we spend an extraordinary amount of time trying to combat terrorism in its many forms across the world.  Sure, if you're engaging in counterinsurgency strategy, killing people and breaking things so your desired faction gets an advantage is one method you can employ. It's a quick surge (no, not necessarily *that* surge) of military power to tip the scales, giving your preferred \"team\" the advantage.\n\nIf you're adopting or transitioning to a counterterrorism strategy, however, this will often involve outreach to the local population and its leaders; providing security; offering resources such as food and clothing, and; generally trying to create conditions that will lower the fear factor of local populations caving to terrorists and heighten the personal investment in building up local communities.\n\nWe found this out the hard way during the early stages of Iraq, obliterating the enemy but also obliterating civilians and their homes as well.  Even ignoring humanitarian outcries, this makes it far easier for terrorists to make physical incursions since local populations are vulnerable and scared, and thus more likely to acquiesce to their demands.  It makes it easier for \"emotional\" incursions, because you have a whole generation sympathetic to parties who are going to kill the people and break the things that killed their families and broke their things.\n\nIn contrast, we saw way more gains when our military began taking up a police function.  It still had traditional military characteristics, including the realistic ability and legal authority to kill and break things when necessary, but it also adopted a more security/rebuilding role, trying to keep streets safe for people and commerce while providing training, building and resources.\n\nIf I wanted to explore the issue further, I'd go so far as to say the best anti-terrorism strategy is going to strongly resemble a nation-building strategy.  It takes time and dedication that most leaders of democratic nations won't be able to muster for the long haul, but that's neither here nor there.  The fact remains that modern military hurdles have expanded beyond showing up on a physical field of battle and trying to outgun the other guys -- which, if we're being honest, is a *vast* oversimplification of historical warfare, and is yet another reason to be skeptical of Huckabee's military acumen.  It's choice phrasing designed to be blunt and appeal to folks who view the military as a cosmetic addition to America's display of strength.  It's not an accurate framing of any military's role, particularly not one like ours that is contributing to such a wide spectrum of international causes, even if we're ultimately there in some form for our (proactive) defense.\n\nSecond Response: \nHistorically, that's what they used to do, sure.\n\nThe (legitimate*) purpose of the military is and has always been to defend the public from foreign threats. Now, you're right that the most normal way to do that is to kill people and break things. Killing the damned Nazi that tried to take my house or breaking the tank he's driving is a perfectly reasonable way to protect people from a big foreign threat that manifests in a simple way, often in a uniform or within defined borders.\nBut those sorts of threats aren't very common any more, are they? Modern threats are a good deal less complicated.\n\nTake Vietnam^. The military tried their standard kill-people-break-stuff routine. In fact, they did it way better than they've ever done it before. How'd that go? Did it mitigate the supposed threat from the NVA? Nup.\n\nAnd most modern tasks for the defence force are like that. Aside from China, which is deterred by MAD, all of America's threats, from Al Qaeda to African civil war, are unconventional. That means the US military needs to adopt a more sophisticated approach than Mike Huckabee is capable of understanding with his pea brain. This might be something like counter-insurgency, perhaps. These would involve much more than mere violence. EG, in Afghanistan the strategy is clear and build - political science is just as important as violence!\n\nThis is why people make fun of Mike Huckabee: he's too stupid or dishonest to be capable of understanding complex things like basic strategy.\n\n*The military can also be used for a bunch of other things, like invading and toppling democracies as a welfare handout to American big business.\n\n^Whether or not Vietnam was a real threat is immaterial.

Yes, you are allowed to say that, but if you actually had something to back it up, say \"sporks are far more versatile, cutting the required utensil manufacturing by a third, reducing global warming 93%\", you would say that.

In countries like Germany and Denmark, only the best of students make it into higher education, whereas in American, our standards to get into a university or a community college are laughable. \n\nWould we need to raise the bar on admission requirements if college was free?  The main argument here is that making college education free in our system would end up hurting the overachieving students.\n\nFirst Response: \nwhat many employers are looking for in a college degree is that you were able to muddle through and finish, since that shows you are willing to put up with it, not that you were willing to pay a lot to do it. this is especially true if you are applying for a job that doesn't really have anything to do with your degree. the degree will still mean something if the cost were free since many people still will not finish.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think the key to remember is that we aren't making college free to improve the value of the degree, but the value of the people.

Because they're dead. Every other tax they can bribe, dodge, cheat, and evade their way out of. But dead men cannot protect their wealth. And without at least some forms of taxation that impact the wealthy you are looking at a long list of troubles down the road. They are a tax that is hard to find a good substitute for, simply because so few taxes can be effectively applied against the rich in most political systems. \n\nIt practically a saying in Chinese history that when a dynasty loses the political strength and will to effectively tax its rich, the dynasty's collapse is soon after. Not taxing the rich has long term implications for stability and peace within your society that are not pleasant.\n\nThe question is how to properly design an inheritance tax. It sounds like Spain starts progressively taxing inheritances starting at anything over ~8000 pounds. The US starts taxing inheritances at anything over $5 million. Spain's tax hits most people. The US's tax only hits the truly wealthy. There are other ways to design an inheritance tax, perhaps the problem isn't inheritance taxes, but Spain's inheritance tax?\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;I am currently living in Spain and was chatting to some Spanish people today. They mentioned that if you inherit a house you are required to pay a portion of the value as tax.\n\nYeah I can see how that would be a problem. Particularly for people who do not want to sell their loved ones home, but who also don't have the liquid assets available to pay the tax. \n\nAs far as I know, the inheritance tax (on a federal level) in the USA only kicks in once you bequeath or give a relative an amount over 5 million dollars or so. So basically as long as no one in your will gets more than approx 5 million dollars, they do not have to pay any estate tax. As a result, the estate tax affects a very tiny number of people in the US. \n\nStates have their own estate taxes. Some of which only kick in once the person exceeds the federal limit, and some of which are completely independent of the federal limit.\n\nEssentially, at least in the case of the US, the estate tax only affects people who are quite wealthy, or those who are moderately wealthy but only have one or two living relatives. I'm not sure if this changes your view, but it at least shows that the people who are most affected by such laws are usually the people who are \"hurt\" less by them. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the responses to the original post regarding inheritance tax, we need to evaluate various stylistic elements:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - **First Response**: The tone is assertive and authoritative, attempting to instill a sense of urgency about the issues at hand.

It presents a comparative analysis of inheritance tax applicability, focusing mostly on providing context that may alleviate the OP's concerns without a strong pushback on their views.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**:\n   - **First Response**: Contains longer, complex sentences which may require deeper engagement to unpack the arguments presented. It's less accessible but potentially more compelling for those who appreciate a robust discussion.\n   - **Second Response**: Features shorter, clearer sentences that logically progress from one point to the next, making it easy to read and understand.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**:\n   - **First Response**: Engages the OP by addressing the overarching issues related to wealth inequality and societal stability, possibly making the OP reflect on broader implications but not directly addressing the personal anecdote about Spain.\n   - **Second Response**: Directly engages with the OP's experience in Spain, showing understanding and acknowledgement of their individual situation. This could foster a greater connection with the OP, showing acknowledgment of their frustrations.\n\n**Prediction**: $$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factors**:\nThe second response's empathetic tone and direct engagement with the OP's personal experience likely resonates more strongly with the OP. By acknowledging their concerns while providing information that could shift their perspective on inheritance tax's impact, the second response presents a less confrontational and more informative approach. This method is often more effective in changing minds, especially when a person feels understood and is given context that may challenge their beliefs without direct confrontation.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 30, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The government should NOT be able to force businesses to serve customers/cater events the business does not want to serve/cater.\n\nOriginal Post: \nSo neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument.\nAll modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.  \nSo prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all.\nPlease excuse the weird grammar and sentence structure, I just woke up\n\nFirst Response: \nIn a capitalist system, the person who would be making decisions about who the business serves is most often not the person who is actually dealing with the customers.  So in most cases this discrimination would involve a boss telling his employees not to serve certain people.  In a hypothetical non-capitalist, non-hierarchal society (whether or not you believe such a society would be feasible), this might be more about free association, and non-discrimination laws might not be as necessary as you could ask any other worker to help you.  But in a capitalist world, there is a higher risk that a business owner could be preventing a certain group of people from accessing an important resource.  And I can't see it as \"enslaving\" a business owner to prevent him or her from having a policy that certain groups of people should be refused service.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think it is ludicrous for a business to turn away customers for irrelevant matters.  Doing so, to me means you're no longer so much in the business of making money, you're now making a political statement. You're essentially giving your customers a litmus test and if they pass you allow them to purchase your services. \n\n\nGiving employees such tests is illegal, why should it be legal to apply the same sort of tests to customers? \n\n\nThese laws protect consumers. End of story. These people are not going into establishments and ordering non-menu items, they're not walking into Muslim owned diners and demanding pork, they're not going to subway and demanding a big mac,  they're not being unreasonable in the slightest. Therefore I believe that it is the government's duty to protect these people. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the emotional tone and clarity of the second response, which contrasts with the more analytical yet reserved tone in the first response.

{"index": 31, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Rock music is no longer culturally relevant\n\nOriginal Post: \nRock and Roll music is no longer an important part of the cultural conversation. This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made, that that music is never popular, or that that contemporary rock music isn't good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classical\u2014while there is still lots of it being made, it's not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hip-hop and EDM.\n\nOf the current Top 10 on the Billboard charts, the only rock single is \"Shut Up and Dance\" by Walk the Moon, at #9, and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Wap's \"Trap Queen.\" The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters, a band that has been around since the late 90s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then (and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana, a band whose largest cultural moment was 24 years ago), or the Black Keys, a band playing with a deliberately retro style. \n\nTame Impala and Arcade Fire, two bands that have been lauded for their innovation in the rock genre have on their most recent albums embraced EDM influences, and largely moved away from guitar-based rock. \n\nI would argue that the most culturally important albums of the past few months have been outside of rock\u2014Kendrick Lamar's *To Pimp A Butterfly*, Drake's *If You're Reading This It's Too Late*, Mark Ronson's *Uptown Special*, Taylor Swift's *1989* (in which she ditched her country roots for an embrace of EDM pop).\n\nThere has been a lot of rock music recently that has been great too (Father John Misty, Courtney Barnett, Colleen Green, and Jim O'Rourke have all released albums I have absolutely loved, and I just listened to the new Titus Andronicus album yesterday) but that has become an exception, and as my examples point out, it's not really commercially popular or culturally relevant beyond a small core. \n\nI don't have a real problem with rock losing its cultural cachet. I love rap, R&amp;B, and electronica as well, and think that there is a lot of great innovation going on in modern music (and even that 2015 is an all-time stand-out year). But I think that rock has lost its importance in the wider culture, and that rock music is now even imbued with an inherent feeling of throwback, the way that jazz now makes people think of a certain time period even as jazz continues to innovate to this day.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Look back at the heyday of punk or prog rock or thrash metal and you'll see it was largely some version of pop that dominated the charts. Pop-punk, grunge and nu metal were largely short-lived trends (from a mainstream exposure standpoint.) Rock has always had one foot firmly in the underground, which is why its descent into irrelevance has been proclaimed in every decade. Most rock bands reach their commercial peak late in their career. Bands like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush and Iron Maiden weren't critical darlings at the time of their most classic albums.\n\nSecond Response: \nIMO, rock - especially modern metal - is more \"culturally\" relevant than ever before. But it's more relevant to a different demographic; people who are connoisseurs of music and the like. It's the same move that jazz and blues made when rock became dominant in the '50s and '60s. \n\nThe music of the masses is now hip hop, EDM and stuff like that. But stuff like metal and punk are no longer seen as lowbrow.

It employs a matter-of-fact, almost nostalgic approach, suggesting that the perception of rock's irrelevance is historical and not truly reflective of its ongoing influence.\n2. **Second Response**: This response carries a more optimistic tone, framing rock, particularly modern metal, as evolving and gaining relevance among a specific demographic. It leans towards a positive perspective that acknowledges the fragmentation of musical relevance rather than outright dismissal.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n1. **First Response**: The response employs historical comparisons and examples of prominent rock bands to support its claim. It uses references to past genres and movements, thus appealing to nostalgia and invoking a sense of historical continuity.\n2. **Second Response**: Here, the author utilizes an analogy between the transitions of jazz and blues with the current state of metal and punk. This comparison serves to position rock within a historical evolution rather than decline, suggesting that genres can find new life in niche audiences.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n1. **First Response**: The sentences are longer and more complex, requiring more cognitive effort to follow the argument thoroughly. Historical references could possibly make it less accessible.\n2. **Second Response**: The language in this response is more straightforward and organized, using simpler sentence structures. As a result, it may be easier for readers to quickly grasp the central points.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n1. **First Response**: This response doesn\u2019t directly engage with the original post's personal feelings towards rock music. Instead, it provides a broader context but does not show an understanding of the original poster's specific experiences or feelings.\n2. **Second Response**: This response engages more intimately with the possible transformation of rock culture and redefines its relevance. By acknowledging shifts in demographics and music taste, it shows a greater understanding of the original poster's intent to explore cultural relevance.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Key Factor(s) Leading to Prediction\nThe second response successfully articulates how rock, specifically modern metal, finds relevance amidst changing cultural trends and demographics. It connects with the original poster\u2019s point about the evolution of music, thus fostering a better understanding and engagement with the original argument. This nuanced appreciation for the ongoing evolution and recognition of rock\u2019s niche significance likely makes it more persuasive in altering the original poster's perspective. \n\nIn contrast, while the first response provides historical context, it fails to resonate emotionally or logically with the original poster's argument about contemporary relevance and thus may be less effective in changing the viewpoint presented in the original post.", "is_correct": true}

I think you're equating a scientifically-backed principle with a symbol of a defunct rebel government.  It sounds like what you're saying is that because someone has killed in the name of X, X should not be taught or celebrated.\n\nIn fact, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a principle that someone *hasn't* killed someone over.  Just about every religion fits this bill, as well as every governmental system.  If you try to suss out the one that hasn't had any blood spilled, you'd be as silly as  that scene from Rain Man in the airport.

That's all.  It's not moral or immoral--it's amoral.  Just as amoral as the idea that water is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\n\nThe Confederate flag was a symbol used today to harken back to a group of rebels (IMO, racists).  Whether it symbolizes heritage, hate, or a heritage of hate can be argued, but that isn't scientific.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe confederate battle flag stands for a political ideology that supports white supremacy and racism. Evolution by natural selection is a scientific theory on which individuals of a species continue on to reproduce. Darwin did not intend for evolution to be used as a way to govern a society. Survival of the fittest isn't even his idea, it was a fanboy named Herbert Spencer who sought to find a way to explain the theory to simpletons.

{"index": 33, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: China is Not Currently a Serious Challenger to Western Dominance Because of its Lack of Cultural Influence\n\nOriginal Post: \nIt appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is *cultural influence*. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole *idea* of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably.\n\nHowever, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation. Heck, even Japanese bands are some of the most globally popular Eastern bands (though South Korea might take the crown with regards to this one after PSY).\n\nThe point I'm making is that apart from cuisine, I cannot see of any real cultural impact Chinese culture has had on the rest of the world, especially when compared to the influences of Western culture as well as Korean and Japanese culture. Because of this, I find it hard to take China seriously as a social threat, although politically and economically I accept that they are strong.\n\nFirst Response: \nEven if we take your idea as 100% accurate, that china has zero cultural influence, all you need to do is look at the de facto impact that they (and to a lesser extent, Vietnam, Cambodia, and bengladesh) have already had. The American textile industry, as well as electronics, IT (shared with outsourcing to India) and general manufacturing have become nearly extinct. China has already shifted our culture by making it a service-based economy.\n\nSecond Response: \nEvery major city in America has a Chinatown in it, many Americans get Chinese characters tattooed on themselves, Chinese martial arts movies are pretty popular and have won awards in American organizations (like Crouching tiger hidden dragon), Jacky Chan and Bruce Lee among others are household names, martial arts in general, Chinese influenced Budhism and Taoism(Zen), mainstream tv shows like *Fresh off the Boat* are evident of the growing influence, [Chinese as a foreign language is becoming a more prevalent choice]( http://www.denverpost.com/ci_21825189/mandarin-chinese-becoming-first-choice-second-language), [China is growing as a tourist destination]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_in_China) strengthening its influnce abroad, as its economy grows you'll see more cars, electronics, and other household goods (you'd be surprised how many household goods are already designed and manufactured in China), Chinese cuisine is ubiquitous in American cities, and bigger and bigger contributions in science that will affect us all.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Engagement**: The second response adopts a more positive and engaging tone by highlighting concrete examples of Chinese cultural influence, thus directly challenging the original poster's assertion.

I would argue that one cannot make a universal ethical argument on eating meat. Humans still today, subsist on hunting for wild animals in areas where resources for cultivation are scarce. To claim that meat is murder, you would have to believe that indigenous people in the world should starve to death or be locked in prison.\n\nIf you are planning on becoming vegan because you believe meat is murder, why then would you go so far as to not consume eggs or dairy? You can go buy free range eggs pretty easily in most places these days.\n\nI would further ask how far you plan on taking your veganism. Do you plan on using products tested on animals? Eating honey? Eating produce grown using animal fertilizer? \n\nSecond Response: \nThe way I like to see this is kinda human nature. Survival of the fittest. Eventually, animals we eat could evolve to survive and not be killed off so easily. But you shouldn't think it's wrong. So you think that we should do our best to make bears stop eating fish?

That's all the pronouns you are getting.\n\nOriginal Post: \nMy proposition is that pronouns past the three most common ones are not necessary and are actively harmful. An example for some of the new pronouns that can be encountered in the wild is \"xe/xer/xerself\" or \"zi/zis/zimself\". My argument is as follows:\n\n1. Pronouns are always dealing with a spectrum. A \"he\" can be used to describe both masculine as well as feminine men and similarly for she and women. The singular they is also covering a spectrum, the spectrum of all people that do not identify with either gender or those that identify with both to differing degrees. Therefore they is sufficient to describe alternative gender identities.\n2. If we'd decide that new pronouns are necessary to describe or be inclusive to specific non-standard gender identities, we would very likely end up with a sheer infinite amount of pronouns. Since the argument for further pronouns would not be based on scientific facts but rather on feelings of individual people, the argument why some new pronouns are okay and others aren't would be a very difficult one to make. The result would be that we would have to allow anyone to pick or create their own pronouns.\n3. Since we'd have a large number of new pronouns people would very likely get confused, since they'd not only have to remember a name and a face but also the specific pronouns of a person AND incorporate those into everyday speech. The result would either be that people would start inadvertently giving offence or our speech patterns would change to rely far more on using names instead of pronouns. \n4. Having a wide range of new pronouns would actively harm the English language by making it less clear. Encountering unknown pronouns would confuse people and make it difficult to imagine what kind of character is being talked about.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The words he/she are forcing me to both know and share data about a person's gender when I have no interest in doing so. Similarly in some more generic context where I am talking about a theoretical individual who doesn't actually exist yet and whose gender will be irrelevant, I am forced to use \"he/she\" to refer to them. This is ridiculous. \n\nSecond Response: \nI don't think your 4th point makes much sense. How exactly would extra pronouns make things less clear?   Under the current system, the singular \"they\" can refer to male, female, and other identities, which is about as unclear as things can get.  Even if you don't know the exact definition of \"xe,\" for example, it's at least clear that the individual is actively trying to avoid a more traditional word because it doesn't reflect who they consider themselves to be.

This was probably because I am the youngest of five siblings and was fairly better looking than my classmates (before the acne, bad eyesight and crooked teeth kicked in) among other things. \n\n\nI realised this because of the way my classmates talked about me and treated me and I took the summer of 8th grade to transform into somebody else. I do not recall how exactly I did it but I did. Everybody was surprised, myself included, that the transformation was permanent and genuine.\n\nSadly, I was no longer a bitch but a pushover instead. I was bullied shortly after and had a horrible 8 or so years until I graduated from university. During those 8 or so years, my first love died in a car crash, my parents had a terrible accident leaving my mother unable to walk for a year, of course I picked up smoking, I started to serial-date guys and their treatment to me kept getting progressively worse all while I tried to do well at university because it was getting too expensive for my parents to pay for and getting a job wasn't enough for me to sustain myself.\n\nAdd to the above a religious struggle between myself, my society and my own mother who didn't talk to me for three months while I lived in the same house as her because of my religious and romantic choices (I was dating a black guy), and you get a fairly broken person.\n\nI didn't trust anyone, I was naive, nervous, insecure, a people pleaser, somewhat promiscuous and a smoker. I did things I never thought I'd do and was put in situations I never wanted to be placed in.\n\n\nI was even ashamed of my own psychologist whom I never went back to visit after a couple of sessions because of how fucked up I was.\n\nMy issues seem trivial but these are just the things that I haven't blocked out. My view does apply to individuals who have gone through everything but EXTREME trauma. \n\nMy POINT is: How can I, and so many people who have gone through worse, emerge as functional if not even better people than we were because of what we went through by using our own logic and reasoning, the help of others, counselling and other resources, while others simply act as if life is supposed to be somehow tailored for them and that whatever 'triggers' them by making them actually have to THINK about what they went through should somehow be erased from their lives?\n\n\nTl;dr: Shit happens in life and people should wade through the pile of crap and come out as functional human beings via their own logic rather than project their issues unto others and claim that whatever 'triggers' them to think about their problems must somehow be banished or banned. \n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Do they not have triggers? \n\nI agree with you that society has gone a little overboard with the idea of something \"triggering\" someone else. And I also agree with you when you say we shouldn't have to tailor everything we do to make others feel comfortable. But that doesn't mean triggers don't exist or that they aren't real. There's a reason many soldiers can't watch certain movies or hear the sound of fireworks. PTSD is a very real mental disorder.\n\nSecond Response: \nTriggers are a part of PTSD, a debilitating psychological illness that results from traumatic events. Telling someone with a serious PTSD trigger to get over it is like telling someone with depression to cheer up or someone with schizophrenia to un-fuck up their brains: it's a unhelpful and impossible.\n\nYour experience is irrelevant, your trauma may have been unquestionably bad, but you do not speak or represent other people even in similar scenarios to yours.\n\nTriggering someone doesn't force them to think about what they went through to deal with it. Triggers induce panic attacks, when your brain enters those, there's no room for \"logic and reasoning\" only an unavoidable sense of impending doom. When soldiers hear fireworks, they're not mildly disturbed by memories, many get into a fetal position and simply cannot function. Rape survivors when held or hugged too strongly when they don't want to be, feel like the worst experience of their lives is happening again and enter a panic mode.\n\nMany people with triggers don't demand they be banned, but that they are notified of triggering things so they can brace themselves or avoid the trigger. Because nobody wants to have a full meltdown at the movies or during class.\n\nDo people bullshit about triggers?

In contrast, the first response is more analytical and lacks the same depth of emotional engagement.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs analogies effectively, comparing the experience of someone with PTSD to that of individuals with other severe mental health issues such as depression and schizophrenia. This strategy serves to humanize the argument and make it clear that the issues surrounding triggers are serious and deserving of a nuanced understanding. The first response, while valid, relies primarily on asking a question regarding soldiers with PTSD and offers less rhetorical flourish or depth.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response directly challenges the original poster's viewpoint and uses the poster's own experiences to highlight how subjective trauma can be. It emphasizes that while the original poster's experiences matter, they should not overshadow or invalidate the experiences of others facing different challenges. This engagement likely provokes a deeper reflection from the original poster. The first response, while it does agree with some points made, does not challenge the original opinion as forcefully and may not as effectively prompt a change in view.\n\nOverall, the second response's combination of empathetic tone, strong rhetorical techniques, and direct engagement with the original poster's argument provides a compelling case that is more likely to encourage a reconsideration of views on triggers and their validity.", "is_correct": true}

{"index": 38, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Due to the way sex is portrayed in the media, and several other factors, the majority of American males will never have a truly gratifying sexual encounter.\n\nOriginal Post: \nYes I'm an American male, and I don't know how things differ for women or those outside the United States, so I'll leave those two large groups out of the discussion. \n\nFor any given American male, I believe the chances are less (possibly way less) than 50% that he will at some point in his life have a sexual encounter that truly fulfills his fantasies. I think this is due to a combination of factors, that when taken together hurt his chances greatly:\n\n1) Most mainstream media (movies, TV, magazines, websites, porn, etc.) focuses on very attractive women (and men). Most people (maybe 80-90%) don't get anywhere near those standards. Yet the media offers what becomes, in many cases, the yardstick by which we judge attractiveness. This means the pool of attractive potential partners becomes smaller both for the guy and for those he has an interest in.\n\n2) Many if not most men watch porn, and a lot (though certainly not all) of it glorifies unrealistic or demeaning things done to (generally) attractive people who are paid to do it and to act like they enjoy it whether they really do or not. A ludicrous amount of free porn is available to most people, usually from a young age, and much easier to access than an actual partner.\n\n3) Lots of food, sedentary lifestyles, increasing obesity. This ties in with #1, in that we're taught that obesity is unattractive, yet people are getting fatter because of... lots of things, but we'll just say food is a business that's very heavily marketed to us, and usually not to keep people in good physical form.\n\nI think this is a recipe for fat, porn-addicted dudes who dream of boning the hottest of the hot in ways that most self-respecting people would refuse. I'm sure some guys are lucky enough to have a truly gratifying experience with another person, but I think the majority will have to settle for something less than what they dream of.

The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:\n\n#Cities have significantly better municipal services.\n\nThe difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.\n\n#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.\n\nA really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.\n\n#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.\n\nIf you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything.

You're accustomed to having everything as fast as you want it. Country people aren't. They know and accept some things are going to be a hike.\n\nIt's also possible you don't really \"hear\" the noise around you all the time like someone who hasn't grown up with it or lived in it for many years, would. Silence is golden, and if you live in an area where you can never have that, it can drive some people mad. \n\nIt's difficult to say one is \"better\" than the other. I'd vouch both have their bonuses. \n\nThe quiet, the privacy the country affords, the beauty of it. Enjoying nature, having a big garden, maybe even some farm animals. You can't do those things in the city and those things sure can keep people, very busy. \n\nThe bugs one though, come on.

Some people really enjoy moving into a small community and getting to know their neighbors, and some people feel isolated, small, and alone with the \"pseudo-anonymity\" that comes with living in an apartment complex in the middle of the city.

If all you want to do is go hiking on the weekends and tend your garden at home, the city won't be what you're looking for. The mountains would be a lot closer to the country, since they're *in* the country, and you'd be able to use your home space a lot better than if you had to walk ten blocks to a small patch of land cordoned off for a community garden (plus you'd have more space to grow).\n\n&gt; bugs\n\n&gt; holy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa\n\nI trust you've never rented a cheap apartment in NYC?

If someone wants to have and film adult consenting adults having sex then they are free to do this. Instead remove money from the industry to ensure those who do not want to engaged in such behavior do not find themselves with no alternative. In other words, remove the incentive for the creation of such content. \n\nThis idea could be extended to other gray areas where we value freedom but we do not want to incentivize the behavior.  Perhaps limit the profits casinos can make. Limit the profits prisons can make from prisoners. \n\nBasically remove the incentives that encoruage taking advantage of people\n\nFirst Response: \nThe problem here is that economics simply don't work that way. You can't just legislate away supply and demand; the demand part here is what's critical. It's been shown time and time again in American history (prohibition, the war on drugs) that if you make something illegal, it does nothing to stop its proliferation. Doubly so if you're trying to legislate morality. Fun fact: in my state sodomy was a felony until 2013. Guess how many people actually gave 2 shits? If people want to have butt sex, no amount of legislation is going to stop them from doing so if they're reasonably sure they can do it without getting caught.\n\nBack to your points: You can't just \"limit the profits casinos can make\" without forcibly removing people from casinos. Casino proifits are tied *directly* to how much people want to gamble. If you kick them out of the legit casinos and they still want to gamble, then congratulations, you've just pushed them towards \"underground\" casinos and have started giving money to organized crime rather than a legitimate business that pays taxes and helps the economy and doesn't murder people.\n\nSame with porn: if you crack down on the legal enterprises then you leave the people who want to work in porn (or HAVE to work in porn, if you believe those people exist) towards shadier sex work/pornography that isn't strictly legal and is run by various pimps and gangs.\n\nYou can't alter the demand for these things simply by saying \"Nope, sorry, you can't have them anymore\"; human nature doesn't work like that.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe incentive for porn is that people want porn and will pay for its content. Same thing can be said for gambling. People want to gamble. Casinos wouldn't exist if people didn't want them.\n\n There will always be people who will pay for content. Porn made 14 billion last year. Gaming is much larger. \n\nPorn is still going to be made in this country or someplace else. Do you really want all that money just to disappear?

For example, white suburban kids listening to Gansta Rap and wearing do-rags while not having ever (or will ever) experience the specific circumstances that led to those becoming relevant icons in the Black community. Or, more recently, white people wearing headdresses to music festivals (or getting them tattooed on them). Headdresses are, in many Native American cultures, a very sacred and symbolic motif used for specific practices and people. White people who wear them are choosing to ignore the negative parts of Native life and cherry-pick aesthetics. I can go more in depth but that's not the point.\n\nYou are interested in \"appropriating\" from a culture that hasn't had a lot of presence since the 16th century. Though I'm sure you could find an Incan descendent somewhere with an issue there, I doubt you will run into many of them. However, I wanted to address two points:\n\n1. Aesthetics\n\nThis is the primary argument used by people who want to utilize symbols or costumes from other cultures. You understand this is not generally considered a way of \"honoring\" the culture, but picking pieces you think are \"pretty\" with very little regard for their weight or history? Usually, when discussing cultural appropriation in an academic string, this has no weight.\n\n2. \"I may possibly incorporate their symbols for the sun, their main focus of focus worship. Although nonreligious myself, I respect that worshiping the material sun and nature around us is an important trait more of us should take note of.\"\n\nLet's say it wasn't the Incan culture, and it was Hindu. You admit to not being religious, but like certain aspects of their religion, which they probably take very seriously and personally. Do you see how this could be seen as trivializing, white-washing, and \"appropriating\" something that you admittedly don't follow in your own life? It's like saying \"Native Americans worship nature\". \n\n3. I hold a lot of respect for what their civilization accomplished, and would like to \"advertise\" them more through body art\n\nDo you think people don't know about the Incan civilization? Or are you attempting to create solidarity between you and those of Incan descent? Sorry, I don't really understand this point. \n\nSecond Response: \nIf you are taking the specific images from a different culture that you have no direct ties to, (Academic curiosity is not a direct tie.) you are claiming those ties. \n\nIf, however, you are inspired by those designs and incorporate some of the aesthetics and styles into your sleeve that is different. Then you are only saying \"Hey, I like this aesthetic style\". \n\nMohawks are a perfect study of this. Yes, there is a Mohawk tribe of Iroquois. But the strip of hair down the center of the head with clean shaven sides is not specific to that culture, or even common within it. It just became synonymous with that tribes name because white people choose to ignore inconvenient things like \"facts\" when creating style and entertainment. \n\nSo now we're stuck with the name along with lumping all of the native tribes in the Americas together as \"Indians\", the Irish drunk stereotype along with countless other examples or inappropriate appropriation and misleading but interesting factoids. \n\nSo for things already in the general public's consciousness.. yeah. There is a whole lot of appropriation that is going on that we actually know is wrong.. but people are loathe to change their terminology etc. and it's generally fairly neutral compared to other issues facing an appropriated community. Neutral in terms of direct impact. Still not necessarily right... but tolerable. Sometimes... it's a really really grey area that anybody can justify whatever they want inside of to be honest. \n\nSo into that broiling frothing mix you want an Incan Tattoo. Not ignorantly, like a kid who hasn't been taught about WW2 saying they want a tattoo like their Jewish great grandmothers. But willfully and knowingly. \n\nIf you are Incan, have Incan Anscestry or had the tattoo offered by an Incan tribe as a sign of repect and thanks... that would be fine. \n\nBut you really just like the look. \n\nSo make the aesthetics your own without co-opting the meaning behind them. Think about the things that are important to you and use your own designs and interpretations to express your life. Where you have been, where you are, and where you are going. Then if you still want to use that aesthetic as a template you at least aren't stealing other peoples experiences and claiming them as your own. Some would still claim that doing that is too much cultural appropriation. But yet they won't burn their Beatles records...

It uses sarcasm and rhetorical questions to emphasize points, which may come off as dismissive. In contrast, the second response maintains a more measured, conversational tone. It offers a more nuanced exploration of the distinctions between appreciation and appropriation, making it more palatable to the OP.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\nThe first response utilizes direct examples of cultural appropriation, appealing to emotional responses by highlighting the harm caused by improper appropriation practices. It contrasts the OP's intentions with historical and contemporary examples intended to provoke reflection and possibly guilt. The second response, on the other hand, employs a conditional structure that allows for a discussion of aesthetics versus appropriation. It emphasizes personal agency and encourages the OP to formulate their own interpretations rather than adopt from a culture they are not part of. \n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\nBoth responses are fairly straightforward in sentence structure; however, the first response is more complex, often using lengthy explanations and intricate phrases that may obscure the main point for some readers. The second response uses more concise, clear points, making it easier to follow and potentially more engaging for the OP\u2019s reflection.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\nThe first response addresses specific points raised by the OP but does so in a way that can feel more like an attack, risking alienating the OP.

{"index": 42, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: People Should Have Freedom of Religion\n\nOriginal Post: \nI support gay marriage, abortion, etc; however, I also believe that people should have the freedom of religion, meaning, that their religious beliefs aren't as big of a 'joke' as angry liberals make it seem.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that\u2014they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion without the oppression of liberalism the way they expect not to be oppressed by conservatism. Seems very hypocritical, no?\n\nThe point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.\n\nIt all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.\n\nEDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.\n\nFirst Response: \nOk freedom of religion does not entail a number of things, first and foremost, you are free to practice your religion and others are free to criticize you or yes make fun of you for it (which makes them assholes, yes, but they are free to do so, just as you are free to mock non-religious people)\n\nSecond, denying a service of public accommodation to someone on the basis of religion is not allowed. This does not constitute an act of oppression.\n\nIn which ways are religious people being oppressed by liberalism?\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;What I'm trying to say, is that people should not be forced into believing and supporting gay marriage, gay/lesbian/transgender/pansexual and all that\u2014they should be allowed to express their freedom of religion...\n\nPeople are already free to practice their religion, they don't have to support LGBT people and they're not being forced to either. What they can't do, is impose their religious beliefs on other people, they can't get their religious beliefs enshrined into law. Religious people are in no way being oppressed by two gay people getting married, they just aren't allowed to dictate the rules on who gets to get married based on their religion.\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The Second Response effectively engages with the original poster\u2019s arguments by directly addressing the core issue of religious freedom versus the rights of others.

The trend of car ownership will decrease at a faster rate than self-driving cars will increase.  Meaning, by the time we have self-driving cars everywhere, no one will own a car, it will be a completely different paradigm.  \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

[In 2012 California passed a law to legalize the testing of autonomous cars on public roads](http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/09/robot-cars-now-officially-legal-in-california/), as long as there was a passenger on board and there were manual controls just in case. [Just last year their DMV finished creation of the policies](http://arstechnica.com/cars/2014/05/california-approves-rules-for-testing-self-driving-cars-in-california/) to enforce and implement that new law. [And companies like Nissan](http://fortune.com/2014/01/10/just-how-close-to-commercial-reality-is-a-self-driving-car/) are already planning have commercial models available as soon as 2020. We already have plenty of cars that advertise self parking, automatic braking and warning in case the car detects it's about to rear end or reverse into an obstacle... fully autonomy isn't that far off. Do I think self driving cars will be the prevailing motor vehicle by 2040? Probably not, but technology gets adopted so quickly that who knows. But there will be plenty of commercial options (likely for the more wealthy) by then for sure. \n\nSecond Response: \nHave you looked into googles plans for self driving cars? they are not semi-automated, there is no options for manual control. Their ideal plans are less of \"everyone buys and owns a self driving car\", and more along the lines of \"there are now robot taxi's that everyone will use because they are so safe\".\n\n\nIf things go well, I expect there to be a lot of public money invested into self driving cars. Huge safety increases, plus the ability to reduce parking spaces in urban centers is just too attractive. You might be right in that they wont be \"commercially available\", but they will probably be the only(or vast majority of) cars on the road well before 2040.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Analysis of Responses:**\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- *First Response:* The tone is informative and slightly optimistic, focusing on data and legislation to support the argument.

I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The \"it's going to happen anyway\" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?\n\n\n\n\nOf those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It's a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I'm not sure it's something I would ever choose for myself. \n\nBut not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone's hard choice to have one.\n\nWhen is it okay to limit a woman's right to do as she wishes with her own body? \n\nA women's right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her. \n\nIt shouldn't end when he ejaculates, it shouldn't end just because she happens to be ovulating, or because an egg is inseminated. So when should her rights be limited with respect to her choice to abort the pregnancy? When should the rights of a fetus outweigh her right to choose her own destiny? \n\nObviously by the time she gives birth, that fetus has full rights to life. But when did they start? Did the child's rights to life gradually come into being, or were they switched on suddenly?\n\nI think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died.  Only at this point do I see any point in supporting a fetus' rights. Before this it is too much a part of its mother to survive on its own and therefor too much a part of its mother to have rights separate from hers. \n\nSo do I support abortion? No. Do I support it being legal? Absolutely! \n\nAlso, I'm a man so who gives a shit what I think. \n\nSecond Response: \nI feel the same way you do, re not being able to prove whether fetuses are \"persons\" who should have rights (another thread recently got completely derailed, tripping over itself, because of dancing around the words \"alive\" vs \"person,\" so let's not go there--obviously a fetus is a living thing made of cells, just like you, and bacteria--personhood is the question). \n\nIt is sad and unfortunate that we cannot find out if fetuses are persons, that there is no real test. I'd like to know. But it's all in the definition. So my opinion on abortion came from asking \"For a moment, let's say they are persons. Let's even say zygotes are persons!\" From a pro-choice standpoint, this is the worst case scenario, yes? We'll grant the pro-life movement that every fertilized egg is in fact a full person, just like you and me.\n\nEven then, I am pro-choice because I do not think we have a responsibility to other people that goes nearly that far. We do not require people to donate organs, or even blood (which has sooo much less consequence than pregnancy for a much shorter time). Not even to their own children. We do not require people to help others even if they are able. If you want to throw away your food and let someone starve, legally, you can. We may not LIKE this behavior. We may think it is rather awful, even. But we don't want to make it ILLEGAL, because we respect the rights of people to do what they want with their property. We ought to do at least as much for our bodies, which are literally US. \n\nBasically, I think that the question of personhood is actually not one we need to answer in this debate, because no person can hang out inside you, using your organs, causing you substantial discomfort and the potential of death, for 9 months. We wouldn't make anyone sign up for that to save anyone else, not even their child. So why would we do it in the case of pregnancy?\n\nIf your answer is \"they signed up for it cus sex,\" did you sign up for the car accident because you drove? What if you were going over the speed limit? Did you consent to all possible consequences of driving? Maybe, but we still try to save your life when you crash. We do this even for people who are engaging in quite dangerous behavior. Taking a risk (having sex, particularly in the case of having sex with protection) does not mean you signed up for the worst outcome. You know it may happen, but you aren't signing up for it any more than you are signing up for a car accident on your way to work.\n\nWe'll ignore the fact, for now, that in the case of rape no consent was ever given at all.\n\nThis is why I think abortion should be legal, even if I don't like it very much.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include the emotional resonance and reasoning presented.

Well, what happens when when the new MLK is born tomorrow and the government has all these powerful tools to gather all the dirt they want on them, to figure out who the supporters are and so on?\n\nLet's assume the government at the moment is not like that and are honestly doing only good with the info (which as revealed by whistleblowers is not true, but lets entertain the thought). Can you then guarantee all future governments will be so good too? Because once you give your government such powers, it's very hard to take them back. So what happens a decade or two down the line, when a bunch of assholes are in power?\n\nTo support this you need not only believe the current government do not abuse the power (which is a bit naive) but that future governments will not abuse the powers either (which is quite frankly nearly impossible).\n\nAnd for what? The number of people dying in terrorist plots is minuscule, even in 3rd world countries. If you want to save human lives at the cost of freedom so much, you'll be better off attacking the big problems, like obesity for example.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; if the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it\n\nIf one could be certain that this is *solely* how the data would be used, then yes, I'd be in favor it it too, but that isn't how power works.  At least, that's not how it's ever worked throughout human history ... maybe this time will be different?  Right.\n\nIt is also arguably illegal.  So even if we wanted to do this, we'd potentially have to amend the constitution to grant the government this power.\n\nAside from abuse, there's also the fact that these data storage systems cannot be secured.  Note the recent hack of data regarding everyone that's ever had a security clearance background check.\n\nWhile I have not been directly investigated for security clearance, my name is in at least 4 security clearance files as a 'relation' some some kind.  I'm not really happy about that now, and have no confidence that the government's ability to execute such surveillance securely is competent.\n\n&gt;  I'm just glad someone is using my information to make my life and the lives of others to be better.\n\nThis is very specifically the job of the Census folks, not the NSA, and plenty of people don't even trust them either.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include the emotional intensity and direct engagement of the first response.

You know them.  You see them in the cereal section of any grocery store.  They are in giant bags in a metal bin right next to the boxed cereals.  Far too often, these bagged cereals are breezed past and not rightfully regarded as the most superior way to purchase cereal.\n\n* Price - Cant beat it.  Per unit weight, they are far cheaper than their boxed counterparts.\n\n* Freshness - Fresh to death.  The bags all come with a resealable spout, much like a ziploc bag.  Squeeze all the air out, reseal, and you are ready for the next day.  \n\n* Taste - Admittedly, they are not superior in taste to boxed counterparts.  But they are indistinguishable.  \n\n* Environmental - Bagged cereals use less than half the packaging of boxed cereals.  \n\n* Quantity - Get a lot more, which prevents you from having to worry about breakfast for much longer. \n\n* Hilarity - I snicker to myself every day that I pour myself a bowl of apple zings. Never once chuckled at a box of applejax. \n\nEdit - Some good points about selection and variety.  Maybe I should have rephrased my title better to reflect that bagged cereals are better than their boxed counterparts.  I want to reward people for their good points, but I don't know if deltas are the best way to do it as my view was not changed. \n\nFirst Response: \nBoxed cereal stores better in that you can stack them. The extra price is that you are paying for that storage and for a brand name. \n\nAs for freshness, that is fairly  random. You are not at all guaranteed for them to be more fresh. I have also never encountered a bagged cereal with a resealable spout. They have always required attempting to tie the bag in some manner or putting them in a separate container. \n\nSecond Response: \nBoxes:\n\n* stack neatly (if the sizes match, which they are standardized)\n* give you cardboard which can be used for crafts or educational purposes.\n\nIn addition, boxed-cereal brands typically:\n\n* provide better reading material/activities on the back of the box\n* contain better \"prizes\"\n* have more entertaining ad campaigns, which in turn fund other types of entertainment.\n\nI don't know if that's enough of a difference to merit the price difference.

Research also indicated that such a temperature difference makes a massive difference in the amount of time needed for said coffee to cause burns and therefore the dangers associated with the drink.\n\nSuch a difference between McDonald's coffee and other coffee in the city means that a customer has a reasonable expectation for coffee at any given restaurant to be in a similar range of temperature.

{"index": 48, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The Slut/Stud Inequality Is Generally Justified\n\nOriginal Post: \nOr more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \u201csleeping around\", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. \n\nI want to make this point clear \u2013 I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.\n\nThe reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.\n\nGiven these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. \n\nOnce again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.\n\nTo illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.\n\nNow, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.\n\nThe difference between Bob and Patrick is this \u2013 Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.\n\nSo, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.\n\nNow, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.\n\nTo make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with \"crime.\" \n\nThanks!!!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You are correct in that it's harder for men to sleep with a bunch of women than a woman to sleep with a bunch of men.\n\nThe problem is you are attempting to shuffle off the \"Morality\" of women being promiscuous to another discussion, but at the same time you are saying that it's justified to call a woman a slut for doing it.\n\nIf you are going to say it's justified, we *have* to have that conversation as a part of this one. If the only reason we called women sluts was because it is easy for them to have lots of sex, then maybe we could ignore it, but you and I both know that isn't the reason.\n\nIt can't be justified to insult a woman for the same thing you praise a man for, unless you agree that women *should* be insulted for it. It's just not a separate issue. \n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;To make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with \"crime.\"\n\nNo\n\n&gt;Or more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \u201csleeping around\", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour.\n\nIt seems like the crux of your argument is that it is harder for men to sleep with women than it is for women to sleep with men, and since it is more difficult, it is more impressive and praiseworthy.\n\nThere are three main problems with your argument. First, I do not think your characterization of the \"stud/slut inequality\" is fair. When people complain that society treats men and women differently in this regard, it is not because women receive less praise than men. It is because women are met with scorn and hostility. If female sexuality was viewed as merely \"unimpressive\", I think that would be a substantial improvement. Your argument doesn't justify hostility, and so I don't think you have attempted to justify the main aspect of this inequality that people care about.\n\nSecond, your hypothesis has no proof. You could equally guess that women should in fact be more promiscuous than men, because they have an incentive to confuse the paternity of their children, ensuring support from as many men as possible. In fact, I think there is much more evidence here in favour of a social explanation. rather than a biological one. It is harder for people to sleep with women because society will criticize women who sleep with multiple people.\n\nMost importantly, there is no obvious reason why a combination of difficulty and alleged biological incentive make something praiseworthy. There is probably some biological incentive to kill others- less competition for food and mates. It is certainly very difficult to kill someone. Is killing someone praiseworthy? Would we be justified in praising them?\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response directly addresses the logic presented in the original post with depth and insight, challenging the original poster\u2019s assumptions.

Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through.\n\nEdit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help.\n\nFirst Amendment\n\nCops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.\n\n[Here](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/tag/journalist-arrested) are some stories about arrests of journalists.\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nMost states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.\n\nFourth Amendment\n\nCops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.\n\n[Here](http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-rules-police-do-not-need-a-warrant-to-search-your-home/206199/) is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.\n\n[This](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.\n\nIt appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.\n\nFifth Amendment\n\nCops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.\n\nSixth Amendment\n\nYou can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).\n\n[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site) is an article about Chicago's secret prison.\n\n[Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.\n\n[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/deaths-in-jails-885-inmates) is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.\n\nEighth Amendment\n\nSome Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.\n\nI'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.\n\n[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.\n\n[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.\n\nEvery year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.\n\nIt might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?\n\nWell it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.\n\nIf you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.\n\nI'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.\n\n**Edited to link some sources**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

You can in fact get your money back, although most don't. Civil forfeiture is also only used in the case of individuals carrying large amounts of cash, and that of course is the asset most commonly linked to criminal activity. It would be harder to sizes and easier to win back non cash assets.\n2) police have always broken up protests that don't have a permit or occur in non designated areas. This isn't characteristic of a police state by itself. This has gone on in New York since the 1800s, it's nothing new. While current restrictions of protests to limited areas may reduce the impacts protests may have, they are orders of magnitude less harsh than common measures in police states.\n3) bail is as high as it is because it is the cost te state would have to pay a bounty hunter to bring you back. Obviously this is quite expensive, and disproportionately impacts poor people, but there's a quite logical reason why this system exists. This system was not implemented as part of some nefarious plot, it is just a holdover from the olden days, the very earliest days of the country. That also proves that bail requirements are constitutional, our founders approved of them and wrote them into las. Fact is poor people have never been able to afford bail for major crimes,the current situation is the same as it always was. \n4) testimony obtained under duress is not admissible in court. Also if an officer frequently arrests people without cause he will be disiplined by his department. \n5) officers are allowed to arrest and or search people without warrants, such are arrests or searches must be based on the officers reasonable suspecion that the person in question is a criminal. I mean if I was walking down the street in NYC smoking crack, if the cop had to go back and get a warrant he would never be able to find me again. Of course  many cases are less clear cut then this, especially the searches, but it's necessary for the police to have these powers in order for them to properly persecute criminals. \n5) I think your primary problem though is scale. Sure the United States might be more repressive then some other democracies, but is it a police state? Of course not, you hear varied political views on TV, we are allowed to discuss public policy on the internet or in the street, I can oppose the government without fear of being disappeared. If the US was a police state far more dissidents would disappear every year, and political freedoms would be da more restricted. \n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.  \n  \nI don't know what you are referring to when you say cops can tell you what to say. Yes, the police are able to use non lethal techniques to protect themselves and others when people act belligerently and dangerously. I see no evidence of this being abused on a scale that would even sniff at the possibility of the US being considered a police state by any definition. Same for the peaceful protests, there might be a news article or two that I bet you could dig up about this happening. Police having weapons on hand during large gatherings is not at all unusual. Until they use them to point at people who are otherwise peaceful, you have no argument.  \n  \nYour argument under the heading \"Second Amendment\" is not an argument, just a few rhetorical questions. You even admit, rightfully, that there has been almost no major legislative action regarding guns in recent memory. The second amendment does not talk about what weapons the police or military should or should not have.\n\n&gt;Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.  \n  \nCivil forfeiture does require cause and a hearing in court. There are well recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement and if anything, court decisions are breaking against the state. Vehicle tracking devices and cell phone searches being chief among them. See: United States v Jones and Riley v California. If you have other cases in mind that support your point, please cite them.  \n  \n&gt;Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).  \n  \nPolice officers are only legally authorized to execute an arrest if there has been a warrant issued or they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and this person committed it. The bail hearing, or arraignment, typically happens within 24-48 hours of the arrest. The judge will hear about the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest and has the power to set the defendant free if the state cannot produce sufficient evidence justifying the arrest. Then, this addresses your next section as well, sets bail. If bail is unreasonably high for the defendant, it can be reduced and commonly is. Judges don't want to keep people locked up if they don't have to, at least for the most part. State judges are elected officials after all. The bottom line is that cops and prosecutors don't have the time or resources to make bad arrests or bring bad cases to a jury. That's why most arrests are the result of a long investigative process where the evidence is in place and a judge signs an arrest warrant. Cops making an arrest on the street is usually because the crime happens right in front of them or several people tell them person A was running from the store that was just robbed.  \n  \nThe true bottom line is that you are failing victim to the media you seem to want to warn everyone else about. Across the US, crime is at historically low levels and getting lower. Internationally, there are fewer wars involving less people than at any other time in world history. The modern media spends a inordinate amount of time reporting on violence and war that makes it seem like nothing else is going on. Yes, this year, 2015, has featured several national news stories involving allegations of police misconduct that resulted in people dying. They are all tragedies and I hope that police departments across the country learn from the mistakes made in those situations. What almost never gets reported is the boring, routine, everyday police work that accounts for 99% of the police/public interactions. Such stories don't sell. Yes there is abuse in the system. It is hopefully routed out and eliminated. This idea that we're going to someday find ourselves in a perfect world is a pipe dream.  \n  \nSo to answer your final set of questions, yes, you are delusional. That's because you likely consume mostly main stream news media that lives and breathes on sensationalism. Your information has not been shared with us, however, so this is just my best guess. Citizens are safer now than we have ever been, violent crime is [down](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/10/us-usa-crime-fbi-idUSKCN0IU1UM20141110). \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nKey Factors:\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response employs a tone that is more questioning and confrontational, pushing back against the original poster's (OP\u2019s) claims without dismissing them outright.

The first response adopts a more apologetic tone that somewhat undermines its argumentative strength.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response uses a range of rhetorical questions effectively to challenge the OP's assertions. It not only questions the validity of the OP's claims but also introduces evidence in a way that encourages the OP to reconsider their stance. The first response, while presenting logical rebuttals, feels more like a list of counterpoints without effectively engaging the OP\u2019s emotional or critical rhetoric.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response breaks down the OP's claims methodically and uses clear sentence structures that enhance readability. It focuses on the logical flow of ideas and proposes counter-arguments that are easy to follow. The first response, while also structured, tends to read as more complex, which may hinder effective communication.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response directly addresses and refutes specific points made by the OP, which promotes an interactive dialogue. It implies that the OP may be misinformed and invites them to consider a broader perspective. The first response mostly defends traditional practices and laws without as much direct engagement with the OP's cited grievances.\n\nOverall, the second response not only addresses the OP's concerns directly but also emphasizes the role of media consumption in shaping perceptions of police actions and societal safety, which may resonate more deeply with the OP\u2019s expressed fears and prompt a reconsideration of their view.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 50, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: if youre from a western culture and you save up and have your first overseas trip in another western culture, youre probably a bit of a douche.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI always have to hold my eyes to keep them rolling out of my sockets when i hear (australian) people talking about their trips to europe and canada and america.\n\nTo me you have to be pretty dull and boring and douchey to want to go overseas and experience a mild variant of your own culture instead of a different one. Its classic tourist behavior but at least retarded resort-bound tourists outside of the west are pushing their comfort zone slightly.\n\nTravel isnt supposed to be a way to get away from your shitty 9 - 5 that you dont have the guts to quit, its supposed to be a journey where you explore other places and other cultures.\n\nIf other cultures are so scary to you that youd save up thousands to go to a place where language and climate are the only differences from home youre probably a bit of a douche.\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt; If other cultures are so scary to you that youd save up thousands to go to a place where language and climate are the only differences from home youre probably a bit of a douche.\n\nYou seem to have a very narrow view of why people travel.  Many visit other countries to visit family, historical / architectural / artistic sites of interest, professionals in the same field etc etc etc.  \n\nYou will need to be a bit more specific as to why a person spending their money on a trip to a place that interests them makes that person a douche.\n\nAlso as an Australian I see plenty of people spend a couple of weeks on a tour in Thailand or hanging out at a retreat in Nepal (completely failing to immerse themselves in anything resembling the local culture). When these people then claim that they are 'better' than others for travelling somewhere non-Western - now that is being a douche.\n\nTravel isn't *supposed* to be anything other than what you make it.\n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; its supposed to be a journey where you explore other places and other cultures.\n\nOkay, so I'm not going to get into a \"who said?\" version of this debate because that's pointless. I'll accept your premise. \n\nSo what you'd argue is that my trip to Costa Rica is inherently more valuable than my trip to, say Dublin because I live in the United States. Fair enough. \n\nBut here's my counterpoint: I am quasi-humiliated by my trip to Costa Rica because that shit was fucked up. Traveling to non-western (re: poor) countries is an incredibly morally murky process. It doesn't *have* to be but if you don't speak the language (one of your points) you're stuck with using industries that thrive off of Western travelers. And those industries can have a devastating effect on those areas. \n\nNow,we all can get behind the idea that going to Thailand to engage in sex trade is a pretty reprehensible. That's clear cut. But what about that beach resort in Mexico? Who's running it? Who profits? Whose working at it? Under what condition? What local industries/buildings/landmarks got bulldozed in order to capitalize on the beach front? \n\nCosta Rica is absolutely beautiful. But the culture is, with few exceptions, to be folksy for tourists. That's what people do. Much like parents who will amputate a limb of a child so they do better begging, this has some pretty serious consequences. No one is building anything. All the major infrastructure (the resorts, the tour packages, the skyride tours) was built by Western cultures. What's left for locals is to essentially pander to the tourists. And they *do*. And it is kind of sad. \n\nYes, we spend money. I bought bracelets and sodas and magazines and candy. And that, I am sure, has a positive impact. But the net impact, the larger picture, is that the travel industry is pretty much holding people hostage because the money pouring in pours right back out to the people who invested in the infrastructure and only the dregs trickle down. We visited a very rural school and it was so striking because it was one of the only places we visited where we weren't being pandered to. \n\n**So here's my point**: Exploring other places and cultures is an inherently imperialist act. For more info, I strongly recommend reading *A Small Place* by Jamaica Kincaid. The idea you're espousing might actually be more imperialist, more harmful. At the end of the day I think there is value in experiencing other cultures and people, but I also know that MY gain comes at a price for their culture. It has to. But we don't talk about that. We focus on the small gains made by locals who profit off the travel money. We don't think about the bigger picture of who profits from travel and what is LOST in creating that infrastructure. Yes, if you go to rural Laos this is less of a problem, but who the fuck wants to vacation there. Even if you DID, how are you going to get around if you don't speak the language or have any help. That's simply not realistic for most people. \n\nBut western tourism (visiting New York for example) doesn't come with the same moral quandaries. We are capitalizing off our own tourism. We're capitalizing off our own tourism in [Thailand](http://www.bangkok.grand.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html) as well, but we do so by swooping in and taking over. \n\nThe whole \"value\" of experiencing other cultures? We're the ones that made that up.  Probably to sell hotel rooms. In Costa Rica.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the depth and complexity of the Second Response's engagement with the original poster's argument.

By introducing concepts like imperialism and the economic impact of travel on local cultures, it challenges the original poster's perspective in a thoughtful manner.\n\nIn contrast, the First Response adopts a more straightforward and somewhat defensive tone. It questions the original poster's viewpoint and attempts to clarify that travel can have various purposes beyond mere leisure. However, it does so in a less emotionally engaging way and does not offer an extensive examination of cultural implications. \n\nThe Second Response is more likely to influence the original poster because it not only respects their arguments by engaging them directly but also broadens the conversation significantly into ethical territory.

{"index": 51, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The SJW movement uses language of the elite and privileged, and thus does very little to empower or educate.\n\nOriginal Post: \nLet me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with *most* SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.\n\nA college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.\n\nThese are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.\n\nHonestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?\n\nI don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, \"Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.\"\n\nAgain, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you are thinking about submitting a CMV yourself, please have a look through our* ***[popular topics wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/populartopics)*** *first. Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nBefore I get started, I want to point out the problem with using the term \"SJW\" (because this *will* bite you when it comes to the other comments) - it's a pejorative with a definition that's ambiguous at best, and almost no person to whom the term is applied identifies themselves by that term.  If there's going to be a meaningful discussion in further threads, you're going to need to clarify exactly what kind of ideology you're referring to, especially considering the recent trend of infighting within progressive factions (especially feminism) leading to many points of disagreement between individuals in these movements.\n\nIn regards to the terminology, the only thing about the \"SJW\" language that makes it difficult is that it's foreign to most people.  Many of these new or newly popularized terms can be defined for easy comprehension in a single sentence, or even less.  What is \"cisgendered\"?  People that aren't transgender - done.  What is \"gentrification\"?  Rich neighborhoods expanding into poor ones - done.  What is \"privilege\"?  The idea that you can be better off by being born into money or being white - done.  Admittedly, many progressive folks make the mistake of using these terms without taking into account their audience, but it's a problem that is very easily remedied.  And clearly it doesn't take a college education to understand these things, because many of the people advocating for this stuff are still in secondary school.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;Like other left-leaning movements  \n\nThere is no \"SJW movement.\" It's just a pejorative label. There is no group that self-identifies as SJWs. There is no \"SJW\" organization. No SJW leaders. No SJW conferences.  \n\nWhat you view as a movement is just a bunch of independent people with similar conceptions of social justice, and they may have different views on politics, economics, etc.  \n\n&gt;A college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.  \n\nSo...what, they shouldn't use any terms to describe certain societal phenomenons?  \n\nCis and trans are not hard concepts to learn, in fact they're being talked about all the time on the news thanks to people like Caitlyn Jenner. Gender spectrum isn't hard to figure out either. Spectrum is a pretty easy word. Combine that with gender, and it means exactly what it says on the tin!  \n\nGentrification isn't a \"SJW\" term, it's a term coined by sociologists to describe a very specific phenomenon. People who are affected by it know exactly what it is, even if they don't have a specific term to describe it. Giving it a name just makes it easier to communicate.  \n\nPrivilege is pretty easy to define. So is oppression. And identity. And assimilation. These four mean the same as their colloquial definition. Queer is something new, but it's strongly associated with gay rights so its not hard to introduce people to that term.  \n\nOtherkin isn't something people are actually pushing for, where are you getting that from? What movement and mainstream figures are pushing for otherkin rights? None, but mentioning this term is how I can tell your view is colored too heavily by what you see and hear about \"SJWs\" on this site (I'm assuming from subreddits like /r/tumblrinaction and /r/adviceanimals).  \n\nInstitutional isn't hard either, it means exactly what it sounds like. Marginalized isn't an uncommon term either.  \n\n**Note:** even if you don't agree that these terms accurately describe power dynamics in society, that doesn't mean the terms are bad\n\n&gt;These are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments.  \n\nTumblr is just a blogging site with *more users* than reddit. A bunch of users on a social media site is not indicative of a social movement, especially if they don't even identify as such. Your view is skewed by what you see on reddit. They're a tiny, tiny, *tiny* fraction of users. They get attention because people like to go out and find stuff that offends them (ironically, just like the SJWs that are criticized!) and post it for cheap karma. Slap an outrageous quote on an image macro and you've got the attention of tens of thousands of users.\n\n&gt;but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas  \n\nProblem is, most people's first exposure to the idea is usually through pages dismissive of the concepts. I think that is a much bigger issue than the terms themselves. \n\n&gt;How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel?  \n\nTumblr's demographics skew pretty young, just like reddit. There's a lot of high schoolers on the site who do just fine.\n\n&gt;or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts  \n\nThese aren't advanced-level sociological concepts. These are basic 101 terms, most of which, as I've described above, match pretty closely with their colloquial definitions. I think you're exaggerating how difficult these terms are.  \n\nI'm not a sociologist nor have I taken any gender studies classes. Nowhere in college have I learned about these terms. If you were able to read about it on a blog, how high do you really think the barrier of entry is? Social media use is absolutely *huge* among youths today.\n\n&gt;How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?  \n\nBecause it gives them a name to what they're experiencing. Take for example, gentrification. A poor black family is forced out of their home due to rising rent costs because of yuppies moving in. What exactly is he supposed to call that? Do you have a better term in mind?   \n\n&gt;I don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue.  \n\nYour view of social activists seems entirely limited to what you've seen on places like reddit.

The idea of the sub is not to force people to conform, but rather to provide people with legitimate evidence and logical reasoning that they might not be privy to. \n\nAdditionally, when group think is applied in a logical and critical manner, there is nothing wrong with it. Consider this, if people constantly argue and debate things and *only* change their opinions when presented with solid (logical) reasoning, reasoning which they view as better than their own, the final conclusions reached by the majority of individuals will be the conclusions with the greatest basis in logic and fact. Now, this idea is slightly problematic in that it requires everyone to be logical in their reasoning and to only accept sound arguments. However, this very problem is perhaps one of the reasons reddit, and the internet in general, is a great place for such an activity. As I'm sure you are aware simply from spending time on the internet, people are much less afraid to attack positions aggressively and to present some of their ideals which may normally be less socially acceptable.\n\nI think it is fairly reasonable to conclude from all of this that so long as trolling, fallacies and unproductive behaviors (essentially things against the rules) are: recognized, moderated and, when necessary, ignored or removed, CMV is an excellent avenue for one with an open, yet critical mind to learn a great deal. After all, the brightest minds in the world often take part in think tanks and conferences for a reason.\n\nI apologize for the poor sentence structure and overall layout, I'm half asleep but wanted to submit this tonight so I wouldn't forget....

Another thing that I have noticed is that occasionally I'll see a post and think  'What is OP mad?' only to soon find out that there is some logic behind their way of thinking. The vise versa of this has happened as well where I have no idea how something could be argued against only again to be shown that the opposing side has a logical defense too.      \n  \nHowever these are things that I have seen.

{"index": 53, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: 'Historical' films that are 'based on a true story' should be strictly monitored for accuracy, if not outright banned.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI just watched *The Imitation Game* (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it ... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy). I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film ... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing\". This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character.\n\nSometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching *13 Days* (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the 'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was *actually there* argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever ... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified.\n\nThus, **I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.**\n\nI will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance:\n\n* \"They're claiming to be *based* on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" \n\nYes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films *appear* as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.\n\n* \"The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.\"\n\nBut to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows *absolutely nothing* about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching *JFK* (1991). And you know what, they *should* feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.\n\n* \"It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.\"\n\nSuck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch *Pearl Harbour* (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film: 'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, \"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nOkay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on *Pocahontas* (1995) and *Argo* (2012)) - please CMV!\n\n**EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments.

If you want to learn history, watch a documentary\n\nIf you want the most factual based experience from a movie watch a documentary, they are made to entertain AND inform you to the best of the filmmakers capabilities.\n\nIf you want a dramatized version of historical events that is meant to  entertain you then watch a narrative film based on something that happened\n\n\n----\n\n&gt;What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nThe purpose of 99.99% of movies is to make money. Its a business like any other and it sells 2.5 hours of entertainment to people. \n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.\n\nWhat constitutes a valid representation? Art that depicts life invariably gets details wrong, compresses the complicated or what isn't as noticeable to the artist.  It will always be a flawed representation because it isn't the event itself.  At its best, the only thing art can hope to do is capture the *spirit* of the thing.\n\nSo what does it need to depict and to what degree of accuracy before it is considered valid?  Do you imagine historians could form a consensus on this?  Different historians value different aspects of history and disagree with each other as to what precisely happened at any given time, so I highly doubt it.  They would *all* tell you a given film got things wrong, but they would each care about certain errors more than others; one might dispute the ethnicity of a historical figure as cast, one might complain about anachronistic dialogue, another might object to the favorable/disfavorable view of group X doing thing Y at Z point in history.  All the while, other historians will be saying it's as good as it needs to be to convey the necessary information.\n\n&gt;A person who knows absolutely nothing about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching JFK (1991). And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.\n\nThat could be said about any depiction of history, including primary sources that describe historical events and provide the basis of our understanding of most of history.  Herodotus is referred to as \"The Father of History\" because he was the first in European history to systematically gather evidence and form a historiographic narrative.  He  didn't just make errors, he produced propagandistic falsehoods to make Greeks (especially Athenians) look like the best thing since sliced bread.  The idea that the Persian's brought over a million men to fight the 300 Spartans (and a few thousands allies) at Thermopylae comes from Herodotus.  Some of the inaccuracies you see in \"300\" can be traced back to the first recorded account of the battle itself.\n\n&gt;Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary.\n\n*Zeitgeist* claims that it is a documentary, it is full of shit.  Bill Maher's *Religulous* used some of the same evidence to try and argue that Jesus was a myth, he is full of shit. *Triumph of the Will* is, in a sense, a documentary.  *Super Size Me* was a groundbreaking documentary...the results of which nobody has been able to reproduce.\n\nIf you want to learn history, you shouldn't be trusting one source that claims to give you the full story; especially one that is deliberately packaged to entertain you.  You should gather as many opinions on the subject as you can through any media you like and figure out what you think happened based on those opinions.  If you're particularly competent and interested, you can try looking at original source material and try to interpret what it means.\n\nWhat you should *never* do is assume that the movie or documentary you just watched gave you significant historical education.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - The **First Response** adopts a somewhat casual and pragmatic tone, attempting to ground the conversation in financial realities of filmmaking while maintaining a friendly demeanor. It aims to ease the original poster\u2019s frustration by suggesting that movies inherently prioritize entertainment over strict adherence to factual accuracy.\n   - The **Second Response** takes a more analytical and critical tone. It challenges the original poster\u2019s premises directly by emphasizing the subjectivity involved in historical representation. The emotional pull is less about consolation and more about encouraging deeper thought regarding the nature of historical narratives in film.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - The **First Response** uses direct statements and an informal questioning format to lead the original poster to a realization regarding the business nature of filmmaking. It presents its arguments simply and focuses on a common understanding of movies.\n   - The **Second Response** employs a more complex argumentative structure, including analogies to historical methods and discussing notable historical inaccuracies. This response also poses questions back to the original poster about the intricacies of defining \"valid representation.\"\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - The **First Response** features simpler, more accessible sentence structures making it easy to read and digest, suitable for casual discussions.\n   - The **Second Response** contains longer, more complex sentences and depth of vocabulary, which may prompt deeper contemplation but could be a bit more challenging to follow.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n   - The **First Response** engages directly with some of the original poster's statements and uses humor and relatable content to acknowledge their frustrations while gently steering them towards a more nuanced view.\n   - The **Second Response** engages deeply with the argument, addressing points systematically and challenging the original poster\u2019s assertions about historical accuracy and representation, aimed at a fundamental shift in thinking.\n\n**Prediction:**\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factors for Prediction:**\nThe **Second Response** thoughtfully deconstructs the complexities of historical representation in film, encourages critical thinking, and challenges the original poster's original absolutes about historical films.

{"index": 54, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I think rape cases should be fast tracked through courts, and the burden of proof should be on the defendant, not the accuser\n\nOriginal Post: \nFrom https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates\n\n&gt; The majority of sexual assault are not reported to the police (an average of 68% of assaults in the last five years were not reported).1 Those rapists, of course, will never spend a day in prison. But even when the crime is reported, it is unlike to lead to an arrest and prosecution. Factoring in unreported rapes, only about 2% of rapists will ever serve a day in prison.\n\nI think the conviction rate of sexual assault is woeful in this country. It is so difficult to make a successful criminal case against a rapist that:\n\n- Rape culture is highly prevalent and rapists feel they can get away with it, and intimidate their victim into silence\n- Victims of rape have no confidence they will even be listened to, never mind getting a successful conviction\n\nFor these reasons, I think the system should change:\n\n- When somebody makes an accusation of rape, it should be up to the accused to prove their innocence. Until they have done this, they should be considered guilty. The accused's details should be publicized in this time, so the public is protected from them\n- Rape cases should be fast tracked through the legal system, which not only streamlines the process, but shortens the time until the rapist is in prison, again this protects the public\n\nImplementing these changes will give victims so much more confidence when reporting the crime, and it will make rapists think twice before they go ahead with their actions.\n\nI have considered the possibility of a small amount innocent people going to jail for rape, but if these changes help send more *real* rapists to prison, then surely the benefit to society outweighs any minor problems that may arise.\n\nI have been told I'm extreme for thinking this, but nobody has presented to me a compelling reason why it's a bad idea. Please change my view!\n\nEdit: I have awarded deltas to /u/Aftercourse and /u/Da_Kahuna. My view is certainly changed, and I realize now that a lot of injustices would come from my proposed changes.\n\nFirst Response: \nWhile I understand where you are coming from, and agree that measures should be taken, I don't think what you propose would be fair or effective because:\n\n* Imprisonment [simply does not work](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/scans/e199912.htm) as a measure to reduce recidivism. At all.\n\n* 7% of inmates [report being raped](http://www.justdetention.org/pdf/struckman.pdf). I don't think you want to be putting people into a situation where their chance of rape is that high without very good reason.\n\n* Legally, the presumption of innocence is enshrined in the US constitution. To presume someone guilty merely on someone's word is illegal.\n\n* Morally, it is better to set a hundred guilty people free than to punish one innocent person. Thus the presumption of innocence.\n\n* Publicising someone's information in relation to an accusation of rape can be harmful enough to them to be consstrued as punishment, and shouldn't be done without a guilty verdict.\n\nI would propose a different set of changes:\n\n* When somebody makes an accusation of rape, ~~assume they are telling the truth  (edit: insofar as that a rape occurred)~~ edit 2: do not assume they are lying, and forward them to detectives trained to deal with rape victims.\n\n* Make sure they have access to any medical or mental health facilities they need. This is the important thing, as punishing someone will not help the victim, regardless of their guilt.\n\n* Investigate in good faith. Collect any available evidence, and where there is evidence, actually analyse it. This is [not what is done currently](http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/unanalyzed-evidence-sexual-assault-cases), which is probably a big reason for the woefully inadequate conviction rates you see.\n\n* If there is enough evidence to prove someone guilty, send them away. If there is not, we can't be certain enough of their guilt to punish them in good faith.\n\nPunishing an innocent person won't help the victim. It will only harm the innocent person. Punishing a guilty person won't help the victim, it will only harm the guilty person.\n\nStopping rapes in the first place would be the most desirable solution, but I can't offer any magic bullets there.\n\nSecond Response: \nOur legal system is centred around the idea that it is better to set a guilty person free than to jail an innocent person. If we shift the burden of proof to the defendant, it becomes much easier for people to bring malicious accusations against someone. It is often very difficult to prove that you didn't do something. For this reason, in criminal cases, all the defence must to is argue that the prosecution hasn't made their case well enough; they don't have to argue that there is positive evidence that the defendant is innocent.\n\nIf this change were to be implemented, almost everyone accused of rape would be convicted, regardless of their guilt or innocence. This would result in many innocent people having their lives destroyed. It's simply not worth it.\n\nThe current system is far from perfect; it makes it almost impossible to get a conviction. That being said, we should focus on making it easier for victims to report crimes. This requires a major culture shift away from victim blaming. Streamlining the reporting process is not a bad idea. Shifting the burden of proof is unimaginably ill-advised.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the First Response's comprehensive approach that combines empathetic engagement with a strong articulation of legal and ethical principles. The tone remains respectful and acknowledges the Original Poster's concerns, which can be more convincing. The use of evidence-based arguments, paired with moral reasoning about the presumption of innocence and the potential for harm to the accused, helps to create a more persuasive discourse. Furthermore, the proposed alternatives focus on victim support and practical improvements within the existing legal framework, presenting actionable recommendations rather than only negatives, which may resonate more effectively with the Original Poster seeking a change in perspective. \n\nIn contrast, while the Second Response also raises important points about the legal system, its tone is more absolute, and it lacks the engagement quality evident in the First Response.

{"index": 55, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If brothels were legal then the 'by-the-book' strip clubs would go out of business.\n\nOriginal Post: \nAdmittedly Strip Clubs have come to be seen as a fun and even ideal environment for partying. The 'by-the-book' clubs don't allow clients to have sex with the strippers, though of course it most likely happens a lot and many strippers are prostitutes, but not all. The two jobs aren't all that dissimilar (sex work), though stripping is more of an art and I imagine the best performers take it quite seriously and don't sell themselves (cheaply).\n\nOn the client side, I think the only reason strip clubs came to be is due to a crackdown on 'out in the open' brothels and the type of men who would go to a strip club would also go to a brothel if they didn't feel like criminals. If brothels were legalized I can see some of those businesses eventually reaching a similar level of social acceptance, thus brothels will become more than a series of dark rooms full of sex-slaves and may become the amusing harems and menageries of historical fiction. \n\nI find that not only will clients prefer the legal brothel with a nice entertainment budget. Why just go watch a girl dance around naked? Why not touch her as you like and even have sex? Or watch people have sex etc. The type of men who regularly go to strip clubs most likely only go because they cant get attractive women to pay attention to them and are willing to deal with teasing and stripping because an illegal brothel can result in infections or jail time. \n\nI even suspect that the performers will end up working in brothels rather than strip clubs. Seeing as there are women who will have sex with them without legal repercussions men won't throw as much money at a girl who is just taking her clothes off. No doubt brothels will end up having some of the girls strip to entice clients to go into the back rooms with them. The artistic side of stripping, which only exists due to the illegality of brothels and male willingness to throw money at attractive women, will lose a great deal of funding and talent. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There are different levels of sexual objectification and different people are morally comfortable with different amounts. One could have made essentially the same argument you're making by saying that Hooters shouldn't have been open when strip clubs were open, because if you're going somewhere for a woman's breasts why not have her wearing as little as possible? Yet Hooters did great business for years.\n\nAlso, I know of married men who think it's somehow funny/novel to hang out in strip clubs, but would never think of physically cheating on their wives - there's a definite line that exists in our culture that ensures that some of the people who want risque entertainment won't patronize brothels.\n\nSecond Response: \nThere are strip clubs in countries where prostitution and brothels are legal, and there are strip clubs in states in America where prostitution and brothels are legal.  \n\nThere are also strip clubs with varying degrees of nakedness permitted.  I think there's a market for both.  \n\nAlso, I think some people who go to strip clubs wouldn't be comfortable at a brothel.  In America, going to a strip club is a moderately common occurrence for a bachelor/bachelorette party.  Hiring a prostitute may not be acceptable to everyone.  \n\nI think there certainly would be some strip clubs going out of business as they'd lose some customers to brothels, but I think there's room for some of both.

I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds.  Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.

Dealing with that kind of inhuman harassment is incredibly stressful and debilitating, and I can't blame her for stepping down. She's probably realized that being CEO of Reddit is not worth the absurd amount of strife she's faced from users who are, quite frankly, shitheads, but users who make up a vocal percentage of the userbase and users who have been relentlessly going after her (and, of course, many of these users are powerful enough with computers to make her life a never-ending nightmare). It's like the GamerGate victims: many of them shouldn't have \"given in\" to the angry hords of numbskulls, but personal feelings of well-being can often trump standing up against the shittiness of facing a crowd you'll never win over.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;Tyranny of shrill minority is the term I really like. I'm sure majority of reddit will pat each other on the back how \"they did it\", how they overthrow a tyrant and reddit will be back to their good ol' days.\n\nSo are the loud dissenters of Pao (and thus celebrators of her departure) the minority or majority of Reddit?\n\nIf they were really the majority, then perhaps it was best that the CEO reflects the desires of the user base the company depends on.\n\nAnd if they were a small, vocal minority, then who cares about the small group of people she has appeased by quitting?\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the emotional approach and tone of the responses.

{"index": 58, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: \"Gun rights\" are a sham and provide a net-loss in utilitarian good for society.\n\nOriginal Post: \nSorry, this is mostly applicable to folks from the US, but feel free to weigh in no matter what.  I'll bullet-point for my reasoning:\n\n* More good folks are killed via firearms than are saved by them.  The vast majority of firearm deaths are via suicide, which has an incredibly high success rate compared to all other methods.  Therefore since firearms cause more deaths than they prevent, firearms pose a net-loss for society.\n\n* One major reason we believe we need firearms is the 2nd amendment.  The 2nd amendment is essentially an axiom; in order to have a moral argument as to why we should have guns, I don't think \"because the 2nd amendment says so\" is compelling.  If the 2nd amendment told us to punch babies, that wouldn't make it okay.  Therefore whether or not firearms are truly acceptable must be for a reason outside of this.\n\n* Our logical balance doesn't make sense.  To paraphrase John Oliver, one guy tried to blow up a plane with a shoe and now we all take our shoes off at security.  But so many people shoot up so many schools, and we still haven't done anything substantial about it.  On a similar note, we invest how many trillions of dollars on the war on terror, and yet the amount of Americans killed via guns exceeds the amount killed via terrorism by an extraordinary amount.\n\n* I've read Scalia's opinion in D.C. v. Heller (The most important guns case in modern times).  I don't find the appeal to history compelling.  It seems to me that times have changed so much that arguing what Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense.  For someone who claims to be a textualist, this appears to me to be a stretch.\n\n* The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation.  I think part of the American experiment is to allow different states to try different things.  One of the arguments for gun rights is \"what worked for Australia couldn't work for us\".  And yet one only needs to look at Chicago (the city banned some firearms, SCOTUS said that was unacceptable and ruled against Chicago's law) to see that we were never given a chance to figure out what worked.  I would normally suggest an amendment if we wanted to clarify the 2nd amendment for modern times, but it seems to me that nobody will ever be convinced guns are bad (or good!) until we have a concrete application and see whether it works or not.\n\n**Edit: Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be a space in which I can respond to anyone without being heavily downvoted.

They are the best way for one to defend oneself, and defend their liberty. Either way there are more defensive uses with a gun than there are offensive uses with a gun. \n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2013/06/handguns_suicides_mass_shootings_deaths_and_self_defense_findings_from_a.html\n\nYour first point is just untrue.\n\n&gt;Our logical balance doesn't make sense.\n\nWhat John Oliver said doesn't make taking our shoes off right, but just proves why we shouldn't do it anymore. It was done when people were scared, doing the same thing with guns would be just as stupid.\n\n&gt; Thomas Jefferson was thinking and then applying it to semi-automatic and automatic weapons just doesn't make sense.\n\nThey knew semi-auto was a thing, and still wouldn't care. They wanted people to be armed the same way any general military of the time would be.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girandoni_Air_Rifle\n\n&gt;The 2nd amendment and it's current interpretation quashes any possibility of experimentation.\n\nYou shouldn't be able to experiment with removing human rights. Even still DC banned handguns in the 70s and Chicago soon after, and their homicide went up and  didn't drop until decades later when the rest of the countries murder rates began dropping. The fact is those experiments have failed, even Australia's criminologists admit that their gun control did not make them safer from homicide and violent crime.\n\nhttp://www.captainsjournal.com/2012/07/23/do-gun-bans-reduce-violent-crime-ask-the-aussies-and-brits/\n\nhttp://www.ncpa.org/sub/dpd/index.php?Article_ID=17847\n\nSecond Response: \nFirst of all, in countries that ban firearms you see the gun violence drop, true, but you also see non-gun-related violent crime go up. Outlawing guns will only do one thing: Make it easier for bad guys to kill good guys. In days of prohibition they outlawed alcohol, yet criminals still got it and regular citizens didn't. Certain types of drugs are outlawed yet you still have people getting their hands on them. I think you'll find that even if you ban guns people will still have guns ... except they won't be the good people.\n\nPeople like Penn Jilette and Alex Cross are good when it comes to pointing out why we need guns. Penn points out that in the amendment it says that the right shall not be infringed and that it is the right of the PEOPLE to carry guns as the militia does. It doesn't say it is the right of the militia (cops) to carry a gun, rather it is the right of ordinary citizens, because the people that wrote that document in there were fighting a war against their tyrannical government that had better weapons than them. The gun rights for citizens aren't in there simply to hunt, but to protect yourself.\n\nA guy blew up people with his shoe at an airport, so we take our shoes off there; A guy shot up a school, so now school are gun-free zones and it is illegal to enter a school with a gun ... there you go. We're not going to outlaw all guns simply because they were used to kill children at a school, just like we won't outlaw all shoes because one was used to blow up a plane.\n\nIt's true that there weren't fully automatic weapons in the days our country fought it's war of independence ... but that means no one had those weapons ... The point is to arm yourself just as the government does, so if the government has fully automatic weapons, therefor to best protect yourself you might need one too. However, I disagree that we need fully automatics anyway, you can do a lot more a lot more precise with a semi automatic than you can a fully automatic.\n\nHow's this for convincing? Hitler took guns away from the Jews and only the Jews ... then the Holocaust happened. Millions of Jews murdered by their government ... imagine if they had a even a little pistol to protect themselves, that's millions of guns being fired against the Germans and would have obviously inflicted some heavy casualties on the Nazis to the point WWII might not have happened because Hitler would have been so ruined by the loss of half his army. Stalin took away his peoples guns ... murdered them. Mao took away their guns ... murdered them. Castro ... Pol Pot ... and even today in our lifetime North Korean citizens don't have guns, and their people are being raped and killed by their own military.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that lead to this prediction involve the tone, emotional approach, engagement with the original poster, and the effectiveness of rhetorical techniques.\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response employs a more urgent and emotional tone, appealing to historical events (like the Holocaust and actions taken by totalitarian regimes) to instill a sense of fear and urgency around gun rights. This emotionally charged narrative stands in sharp contrast to the more stoic and defensive tone of the first response, which focuses on logical argument and statistical analysis without effectively connecting to the original poster\u2019s emotional stance.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response draws upon historical examples that resonate deeply with people's concerns about government overreach and self-defense. These compelling anecdotes serve to illustrate the potential dire consequences of losing gun rights. The first response, while it provides a counter-argument and acknowledges the original post, primarily dismisses the points without engaging strongly on emotional grounds. \n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response features varied sentence structures and a storytelling approach that makes it more engaging and relatable. It uses analogies (comparing gun regulation to prohibition) to illustrate its points effectively, whereas the first response tends to be more straightforward and less impactful.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response takes several of the original poster's points and counters them directly while also expanding the discussion by offering additional context and implications of gun control. It effectively communicates an understanding of the original argument, which shows an acknowledgment of complexity in the conversation.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the emotional resonance, effective use of historical precedent, and engagement with the original poster\u2019s arguments, the second response is more impactful and likely to sway the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 59, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: A system in which students offer \"shares\" of their future earnings is preferable to the current student loan system.\n\nOriginal Post: \nMy post is inspired by [this article](http://www.ifyouonlynews.com/politics/chris-christie-suggests-students-sell-themselves-to-investors-to-pay-for-college/) in which a major politician proposes allowing college students to sell \"shares\" of their future earnings to investors in exchange for funding their education.    \n\nI have seen people criticize this system as one of \"indentured servitude\", presumably because for a period of years students could not be released from the requirement to pay a portion of their earnings to the investor(s). \n\nHowever, the current system of student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy, amounting to a lifetime obligation anyway (or longer, if they die early and there are co-signers on the loan).  \n\nAdmittedly, fixed-amount loans are better for students who have unexpectedly high earnings -- so this system might discourage some risk-taking.  But so does the current system for those who want to avoid the down-side unemployment and no long-term relief from student loans. \n\nA system of \"shares\" would likely also discourage investors from paying for worthless online degrees, or college amenities that do not advance future earnings. \n\nThis is a relatively new concept for me, so I'm eager to hear from those who want to change my view, or at least help me refine my understanding of the trade-offs.  Thanks for weighing in!\n\nEdit #1: Thanks for all the great comments and arguments so far.  One delta awarded at this point to /u/PlexiglassPelican for suggesting it makes better sense to have the payment based on a percentage of income beyond a basic amount that would have come even without a degree.  (/u/ngxp has also convincingly argued that existing banks would not likely be the ones to enter this new format, but that doesn't persuade me the format is a bad idea.  I think maybe formulaic, risk-averse banks *should* take a back seat in this arena.)\n\nEdit #2: Whoa!  So many great comments and thoughts.  Many here are presuming (as I admit I did when I first started the thread) that what major you choose would likely be a key factor for investors deciding who to fund.  And so many people here are assuming that a share system would be the death of the liberal arts.  Although no one has really argued to the contrary, I now think this is a misplaced emphasis.  Although it is not central to my view, I'm inclined to think that getting a degree in any major at an ivy league school vs. any major at a local community college is going to be a bigger factor than your major choice within a given school.   Also, the share system doesn't have to be a fixed percentage (though probably there is a natural maximum at the point it starts to discourage seeking work).  Finally (and relatedly), getting a degree in something doesn't mean that you are compelled to work in that field.  So getting an English degree from a second-rate university might wind up costing, say 12% of your earnings (above a certain threshold -- see edit #1) for the next 30 years, while getting a Math degree from Stanford might wind up costing 3% of your earnings.  \n\nEdit #3:  Thanks to all who participated in this spirited discussion.  I'm going to wrap this up with a final delta to /u/hacksoncode who made clear to me that those who marry and have a spouse support them after college would need to be prepared to commit a portion of their joint income to repay the investor.  Most of the rest of the comments at this point seem to be covering the same ground, which I have not found persuasive in my view that the proposed system is better than the student loan system:\n\n* Investors would find this product more risky than loans, and so it would not fit the business model of banks\n* Stupid people would no longer be able to, literally, mortgage their future to \"dream\" unrealistically\n* Direct taxpayer funding of college might be better than either system.\n* This deal would be better for some people than for others.  For those who wind up making higher incomes, it would on average be a worse deal than existing student loans, for those who wind up making lower incomes it would on average be a better deal.\n\nEven if I agreed with these things, and mostly I do, they would not change my view.  Finally, there has been a lot of discussion premised (and I was guilty of this too, at first) on the notion that your field of study would be a major driver for attracting investors.  I'm coming around to the view that except in the case of very specialized programs (e.g. engineering, medicine), field of study won't be as big a factor as student achievement and quality of school overall. \n\nFrom this point forward, I may not respond to all (or any) further responses, except if I feel they are really adding something new.  Nonetheless, I hope the discussion continues with others participating as desired!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available. On a nationwide scale, decreasing population means available work. Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday. On a global scale, less population means more available goods to all. What result(s) of an increasing population size could surpass these benefits? If we were hypothetically at the growth cap for the human population, would everybody still get frantic like when it's is brought up that the U.S. born citizen population is reproducing below replacement?\n\nEdit: it seems a lot of the response pertain to economy. I suppose I was wrong in respect to a declining population being beneficial in this aspect. However, I still seem to feel that a shrinking population would benefit us as a species. Our survival, and that of our environment, would be better off with less people. But still, I'm open to changing my view.\n\nFirst Response: \nFirst of all the people who are worried about declining population are worried about it for different reasons. \n\n1) Declining national power. They believe that in the world much of a nation's power is attributed to its absolute population/economic size.\n\n2) Many systems set up in a world of growing population will no longer be sustainable in a world of declining population. In the U.S. context Social Security retirement (SSR) becomes less sustainable as their are fewer a fewer working age people per SSR recipient. \n\n-\n\nSecond of all, all of your facts are in contention.\n\n&gt;As automation continues to improve, less jobs will be available.\n\nAutomation is not a new thing, and has been occurring since the beginning of time (when the first hunter picked up a rock and was able to do the work of ten hunters) , but has ramped up since the mid 1700's industrial revolution.  Your belief is called the Lump of Labor Fallacy in economics.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lump_of_labour_fallacy\n\n\n&gt;Natural resources of food, water, fuel, and other materials are becoming scarcer everyday.\n\nActually they're not. The continuous increase in automation (also called increases in labor productivity) has meant that we are able to produce more and more goods given the same inputs. Also, increases in technology (or technological know how, also closely related to your increases in automation) has meant that we can access more and more inputs.  Peak oil predictors have been wrong for several decades.  \n\n\n&gt;less population means more available goods to all. \n\nActually larger population mean more and more final consumption goods available to consume and at a greater than linear rate. This can be explained by a concept called comparative advantage which allows specialization and gains from trade.  \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage\n\nhttps://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gains%20from%20trade%20specialization\n\n\nBut essentially as the size of the population in an economy grows people can specialize more and more into what they are best suited actually increasing total production faster than the population growth rate.  \n\nAs a secondary effect with specialization individuals become better at doing their more narrowly definded production than they were at any given task when they used to have to do more of them.  This idea was first expounded by Adam Smith in his parable of the pin-factory (which also covers much else that has been previously discussed here). \n\n\nhttp://ozgurzan.com/management/management-theories/adam-smith/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nA shrinking population is, by mathematical definition, an aging population.\n\nThis brings with it a *lot* of undesirable effects. Investing for the future (not even in the economic sense, but in the general sense) requires certain assumptions to change. Even if you say \"hmm the population will be aging so we need to shift our production towards things that older people can consume,\" you'll deal with the unfortunate side effect that the absolute number of people at any certain age will shrink, too. So the very fundamentals of planning for the future starts breaking all the rules we thought were ironclad. Will our future population be smarter than the current population? Does the modeling account for age-related mental slowdown (or full on dementia)? Will our future population be weaker, slower, less flexible, etc.? What does this mean for our future survival as a species? Altogether, it's a problematic issue to plan around.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the stylistic elements and the depth of engagement with the original poster's arguments.

Humans have gone from the invention of writing to the capability to destroy our entire species in just 5,000 years. On a cosmic timescale, that is an instant.

(Just FYI, a quick Google/Wolfram Alpha search tells me the fastest human spacecraft now being designed will go 200km/s, which means it would traverse 100ly in 150,000 years.) Let\u2019s say that, just by chance, this alien civilization achieved our current level of technology very near to us in time\u2014 only 10 million years ago. Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization. And organic life forms are just not well-suited for interstellar travel.\n\nEssentially, I think organic life is a means to bootstrap into existence truly immortal technological \u2018life\u2019. This is true on Earth and on every other planet as well. And just by the nature of cosmic timescales, it\u2019s much more likely to come into contact with the next evolutionary stage of an alien species than to be lucky enough to catch it in the minuscule period while it\u2019s still fully organic.

Seems more probable that either of us will be in the stone age relative to another. So, either they won't have the concept of constructed things, or our concept of robots will be on the same level as an useful sharp stick that makes animals become food.\n\nWhat you might look into in this area is the Fermi Paradox (\"Where is everybody?\"). Basically, given the vastness of the Universe and the endless number of possibilities, there seems to be a significant chance of advanced alien civilizations being present; and it would surely be communicating and doing stuff on a large scale. But if so, how come we don't see any of that?\n\nSome of the logical explanations actually fit the idea that all aliens might be on roughly the same level. Let's say something (Reapers or whatever) resets any life on certain intervals, so all civilizations had about the same start not a very long time ago. But there are other options. Like, there's no aliens. Or, the aliens are so different that we actually see them all the time but don't understand it.\n\nAnother way to look at this: we don't even know how consciousness works yet. That's the reason there's no AI (not the lack of processing power). For example, to make airplanes, people first tried to replicate birds, and failed at that. Then they made something entirely unnatural based on the science of aerodynamics, and it actually worked. So, we don't have this brain science. Some say there's even something beyond just mechanics involved. A soul or whatever. So who's to say it is even possible to make a true AI or digitize a person?\n\nSecond Response: \nA robot is something very different from an non-organic, cybernetic creature. I thought your view was going to be similar to the premise of the X-Files episode \"War of the Corprophages,\" which suggests that much like we send robots to Mars, aliens will send robots (rather than their own people) to a place where we can make contact.

{"index": 62, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: trying a child as an adult makes the protections offered to children irrelevant and is downright vengeful\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis is an issue I feel passionate about, but I also understand my views are not that developed. Very curious to say what the responses are!\n\nJuveniles are given special treatments in trials, there is a focus on rehabilitation an integration back into society. This makes a lot of sense to me, children are still learning and don't have much freedom in life. Many of their choices and actions are an immediate cause of their situation, and removing them from that could potentially help. Not to mention, the focus on punishment in adult courts can likely lead to training a kid to be an offender for life,\n\nTrying a kid as an adult circumvents all of that, and ignores the fact that society expects persons under 18 years of age to need additional supervision and warrant more rehabilitation in the case of crimes. It seems so juvenile that someone who commits a worse crime (and is more in need of rehab) would magically be considered an adult just because of severity. Do actions make someone an adult, or age and experience?\n\nEDIT:\nI think it is also important to consider there is a growing amount of evidence that states adolescence continues up until 25[1].\n\nAlso, many cases that have children tried as adults aren't emancipated minors, it's typically just due to severity. I would consider an emancipated minor tried as an adult more logical, but possibly more morally wrong for a society to do. Emancipation isn't generally a happy thing, and often due to poor circumstances... more rehabilitation would likely make sense, but I see how it would be logical for a system.\n\n\n[1] http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24173194 \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But why don't people relax until their seating zone/group is called when you have a reserved seat?\n\nIt's not like the gate person knows that the boarding tunnel is clear or that the previous zone has almost completed been seated.\n\nIt just seems more relaxing for everyone to go in a \"just in time\" fashion versus standing in the tunnel, then standing in the plane and trying not to make the person in front of you who is trying to get into their seat anxious.\n\nIt's a small thing, but its madness and because we can only fit one lane of people in at a time it seems really inefficient for so many people to be standing around.\n\nEdit: I absolutely don't mean that I would only get up the moment I gave a completely clear line to my seat. That's ridiculous and I'm not coming from a point of laziness. It just seems there's a lot more efficient things the airlines can do to make the process faster.\n\nEdit 2: (Some reason Now for Reddit didn't succeed in saving this edit) I see that a lot of people have a great need for overhead space that I definitely underestimated. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give everyone who mentioned this before my edit a \u2206 but I sure did try.\n\nEdit 3: I also apologize to all for not being prompt in responding. Not surprisingly, I posted this just before getting on a plane.\n\nFirst Response: \nOn crowded flights, the overhead bins frequently fill up.  If you're near the last on the plane, you may be forced to gate check your bag, meaning you have to wait around at the baggage carousel when you get to your destination, plus no access to your bag during the flight.\n\nSecond Response: \nAs someone who flies quiet frequently, I used to agree with you, but now I know you are simply wrong. I used to sit there and laugh at all the people queuing up a half hour before the plane was scheduled to start boarding. I'd wait until I was the last possible person and then stroll onto the plane like I was smarter than every person who had stood around waiting. \n\nIf you care about getting an overhead compartment for your carry-on luggage, you'd better hope you are boarding early. Any sold out flight is going to run out of room in the overhead compartments long before everyone is on the plane (doesn't matter how large the plane is--this has been true for me for domestic and international flights, from puddle-jumpers, to Airbus A380). There is nothing in the world worse than landing at 2AM after a 5 hour, cross-country flight and having to wait an hour for your bag to arrive at baggage claim. I cringe at the announcement that the flight is sold out and some passengers *may volunteer* to check their carry-on item to their final destination.\n\nIf you do not care about the overhead bin, then you are a minority, and you're right that there is no rush to get onto the plane. \n\nBut your statement that \"Lining up to get on an airplane is pointless.\" is entirely false because there definitely is a very good point (in fact, other people on the thread have had other great reasons which I didn't consider because I usually take flights where seats aren't first-come-first-serve).

This response appeals to practical concerns but lacks emotional engagement or a relatable personal touch.\n- **Second Response**: The tone is conversational and reflective. The author shares their personal journey from agreement to disagreement with the original poster's view, which adds a more relatable and emotional element to the argument. They acknowledge a past perspective that resonates with the original post, potentially making the response feel more authentic and relatable.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response**: The use of specific scenarios, such as forced gate-checking and waiting at the baggage carousel, serves as a logical argument, but doesn't evoke much emotional resonance.\n- **Second Response**: Here, the rhetorical path takes a more narrative approach. The responder starts with their experience, creating a story arc that effectively relates to the original poster\u2019s concern. This personal touch not only provides logical evidence but also emotionally engages the reader through sharing discomfort about waiting for bags.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **Both Responses**: Both responses maintain good readability, with clear, understandable sentences. However, the second response is richer in narrative, offering varied structure that can make for a more engaging read.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response**: While it discusses important points, it doesn\u2019t engage with the original poster directly. It presents information without acknowledging the original line of thought, which creates a more one-sided conversation.\n- **Second Response**: This response specifically addresses the original poster's viewpoint and shares a transformation in perspective. It invites the original poster to reconsider their position in light of personal experience and broader observations, effectively engaging in a dialogue.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Key Factors Leading to Prediction\nThe successful change in perspective is linked primarily to the narrative-driven, relatable nature of the second response. By sharing a personal journey from agreement to disagreement, the respondent establishes a connection that the original poster can relate to, potentially making them reflect on their stance. The combination of logical points with a personal story is powerful in changing minds, while the first response, though factual, lacks the emotional engagement needed to prompt a reconsideration of views.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 64, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The actions of the McKinney TX police were not over the top\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'm referring to this news story about the incident at the community pool in McKinney TX.  You can reference it here, the video is down the page and is approximately 7:23.  http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mckinney-texas-officer-leave-after-wild-pool-party-video-surfaces-n371281\n\nI believe the premise is simple, if cops arrive on scene due to multiple reports of violence and encounter a large group of people and they are told to disperse and some refuse, they can be detained.  If they resist being detained, they can use force to detain you.  I'm not a lawyer or law enforcement, but I think this is how it works and is common sense.  Age or race does not preclude someone from following lawful orders.\n\nYou can see the order here (https://youtu.be/l4VayHJzaJU?t=2m20s ), she instead steps off in the opposite direction and is still talking at the cop, at which time he tries to detain her and she physically resists via pushing and pulling.  The cop in turn tries to push and pull her to the ground.  \n\nDuring her active resistance, a couple young gentleman approach in what initially seems an aggressive manner, with one of them moving their hand to their waste.  In hindsight, and slow motion on youtube, you can see that he was pushed towards the officer and off balance, but there was no way for that cop to know that at the time, so he drew his gun and backed them off.  I'm guessing that police are probably trained to do this.\n\nThe entire event concluded with one adult arrested, everyone else released and no injuries.  \n\nI think with all of the seriously horrible high profile police brutality in the news as of late, this story is getting caught up in America's typical response of reacting in an overly politically correct fashion, but I could be wrong.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is a 14 year old in a bathing suit. She poses no threat to him and she was doing what he asked. She got on the ground, there was no reason for her face to be on the ground - look around, almost all the other kids on the ground are just sitting there.\n\nThere was no reason for him to pull his gun on the two kids who tried to deal with the fact that he started physically resisting the girl. He didn't have to pull out his gun - these are unarmed teens. He had other non lethal choices in his utility belt, he didn't have to go straight for the gun, and if you look at the other cops reaction they are quick to get him to put it away. I don't think they really approved of his actions, as every other cop was talking with the teens in a reasonable manner before Officer Farva over here decides to do a barrel roll and cuss and physically restrain these kids, who were doing nothing wrong. \n\nSecond Response: \nBesides the fact that she gave *no* active resistance and was in fact doing what he asked when he chose to smash a 14 year old 90lb girl's face into the ground. Let us remember the situation here:\n\nA group of kids were invited to a pool party at a community pool and were given guest passes a large number of them were black and the community pool was in a predominately white area. As far as we can tell the cops were called because the white people were alarmed by the number of black people and for no other real reason. Instead of talking to the kids, asking them what was going on. Or even listening to the fact that they had guest passes and were perfectly allowed to be there, the cops decided to be aggressive, yell at them, disperse them, and even pull a gun on kids that were running away.

This response is more passionate, using phrasing intended to provoke thought and moral outrage.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:** \n   - The **First Response** uses descriptive anecdotes and specific examples to assert its viewpoint. By breaking down the actions of the officer and addressing the lack of restraint, it builds a logical argument against the police action.\n   - The **Second Response** relies heavily on appeal to emotion and moral questioning, suggesting a systemic issue of racial bias in police behavior. It introduces context around race and community expectations, aiming to provoke a deeper reflection on social issues rather than simply focusing on the incident itself.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:** \n   - The **First Response** is less complex, with straightforward sentence structure that draws readers in with clarity. It contrasts actions succinctly and is accessible for readers who benefit from a direct narrative.\n   - The **Second Response** has longer, more complex sentences with multiple clauses, which may create a more challenging reading experience but also implies the weight of the argument's severity and urgency.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:** \n   - The **First Response** attempts to counter the original poster\u2019s assertions with a direct critique and evidence from the incident, which might engage the original poster by addressing points directly.\n   - The **Second Response** implicitly questions the original poster's perspective by challenging the justification for police actions, thus encouraging reflection on broader themes.\n\n**Prediction: $$Answer: Second Response$$**\n\n**Key Factors for Prediction:**\nThe Second Response successfully shifts focus from a specific incident to broader societal implications, especially concerning racial bias, engaging the original poster on a deeper level.

There's a ridiculous amount of generalization in your post and none of it is particularly true. \n\nFirst of all, no one NEEDS sex. Sex is a desire. It is part of a biological system designed to  propagate the species, of course, but it's a desire based system. You will not die without it. You NEED oxygen. You NEED water. You do not NEED sex. You want it. You'd survive just fine without it. \n\nSexual drive, libido, it's a very individual thing that varies from person to person even without the myriad varying factors, like hormones and medications and traumatic experiences, etc. You've apparently taken women's reaction to you, personally, to extend to all women and decided it's because we don't need/want sex as much as men. Which is nonsense. Most women, like most men, enjoy sex and desire it. If they don't particularly seem to want sex with you (and I'm saying IF, not assuming...just guessing based on this post and your responses), that doesn't mean they don't want or enjoy sex at all. \n\nSecond Response: \nThis is a huge generalization of both men and women.

I know men who don't need to have sex on some kind of regular basis.\n\nI think this perception of yours stems mostly from societal expectations of both men and women. Men are raised to feel like they should see sex as some kind of insatiable hunger (boys being boys).

{"index": 68, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Modern feminism is hypocritical and flawed\n\nOriginal Post: \nTo say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.\n\n1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest \"Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman\" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.\n\n2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase \"Victim Blaming\" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say \"Maybe that wasn't a good idea\" and then get off the hook?\n\n3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality\n\nOf course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The only thing that really makes sense as a response to this is that feminism is, at it's core, about advancing women's issues. The logical framework for advancing that idea is that everyone should be equal, but it is about making progress on issues where women are disadvantaged in some way to men, so your 3rd point isn't all that relevant; feminists might agree, in theory, that there are some areas where men are disadvantaged but they are not going to advocate for those issues to any noticeable extent because that isn't what the movement is about. You have to remember that feminism has a very large political/agend-ized component to it and the ultimate goal isn't to be as ideologically consistent as possible with regards to \"equality\", which is why you don't see feminists going to bat for \"men's rights\" issues. There is a reason why many feminists prefer to be called feminist than egalitarian; the focus is on women's issues. \n\nSecond Response: \nI think the problem you're having is that you are assuming that along with feminism making life equally good for women, feminism also seeks (or should seek) to make it equally shitty. \n\nImagine this scenario: You give two little kids ice cream cones. The first one drops theirs before getting to take a bite. To make it fair and equal, you decide to knock second kid's cone to the ground. WTF? Why would you do that? Why would you chose to make the situation worse for either kid?\n\nAlong that line of thinking, it makes zero sense to advocate for it being okay to hit women or for women needing to register for the draft or to try to revoke the idea that a woman being drunk does not allow for consent. The vast majority of feminists think the draft is wrong, that consent is mutual, and that it is wrong for anyone to hit anyone. But, being feminists, their focus is on womens issues and the issues you describe above are really mens issues - men should not be hit, men cannot consent while drunk, men should not have to register for the draft. That's not to say that feminists don't care about mens issues, but it isn't their main focus. Complaining about that is like complaining that because you support a local food pantry you don't care about starving children in third world countries. You can care about both problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Both responses to the original post provide counterarguments regarding modern feminism, but they adopt distinct tones and techniques.\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** adopts a more analytical tone, focusing on a logical explanation of feminism's primary goals. It offers a structured critique of the original poster's points while maintaining a somewhat neutral perspective. The wording is straightforward, prioritizing clarity over emotion.\n- The **Second Response** employs a more emotional and illustrative approach. By using the ice cream analogy, it invokes a strong visual, making the argument relatable and engaging. The tone feels more confrontational, challenging the original poster\u2019s assumptions and framing the discussion in a very personal, almost moral light.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- The **First Response** uses logical reasoning to explain feminism\u2019s focus on women's issues while acknowledging men's challenges as secondary. The jargon is academic and speaks to the ideological motivations behind the feminist movement.\n- The **Second Response** leverages a powerful metaphor to illustrate its points. This method helps clarify the inherent flaws in the original poster's reasoning by drawing a parallel to a simplistic situation that highlights absurdity rather than complexity.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- The **First Response** employs straightforward, somewhat bureaucratic language, which might resonate well with readers who appreciate clear-cut arguments but could seem dry to others. It is more complex in structure, which may slightly hinder readability for some.\n- The **Second Response** is written in a conversational style with varied sentence lengths and a touch of humor, which enhances engagement and readability.

This approach not only addresses the flaws in the original argument but also challenges the underlying assumptions in a way that's likely to prompt reflection. The analogy used makes it hard to refute while also encouraging empathy for the issues feminists focus on, rather than pushing for a rigid equality in all areas.

{"index": 69, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Whenever younger folks utter the phrase \"respect is earned, not given\" I can't help but understand it as a childish and short sighted attempt to undermine their elders.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWhile I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously \"earning\" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. \n\nHowever, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. \n\nSimply put, I find this phrase (\"respect is earned, not given\") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: \n\n1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.\n\n2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.\n\n3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing. \n\n4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\". \n\nAs such, I think one would be better served by the idea that \"respect can be lost\" rather than \"respect should be earned\".

As such, they are not your peers.\n\nYes, that is what young people are objecting to: the idea that simple time on the planet demands deference (by which I assume you mean that the older person's view is considered valid and reasonable unless proved false).\n\n&gt;to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason\n\nWell, let's distinguish groups for a moment.  Because as I see it, you're treating three groups as being the same thing.\n\n(1).  People who have established themselves in the area they're discussing (so a professor of public health talking about Obamacare)\n\n(2).  People who have established themselves in an unrelated area (a professor of physics talking about Obamacare)\n\n(3).  People who are older but do not otherwise have establishing credentials.\n\nYour argument seems to be that group (3) deserves deference because groups (1) and probably (2) deserve it.\n\n&gt;Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.\n\nBut that experience would need to be relevant and established.  Otherwise your argument is that simply being alive is experience, and thus that age by itself is worthy of respect.\n\nTo wit, a 23-year-old law school student knows more about the dormant commerce clause than a sixty-year-old steel mill foreman.  The latter's life experience is irrelevant to that discussion.\n\n&gt;2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.\n\nExcept your argument isn't a neutral version of respect where we accept that everyone can have a different opinion and there's really nothing age has to do with that.  Your argument is for *deference*, which would mean the younger person submits on the issue to the older person.  That *does* cost something if the issue is either (a) the younger person believes he has a better way to do things, or (b) the younger person believes he is right and the older person is wrong.\n\nIf that weren't true, you wouldn't be posting a CMV, since your logic says that you \"deferring\" to me costs you nothing.\n\n&gt;Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\".\n\nAnd in cases where that's true, the person can say \"oh, and I also have my Ph.D in the subject we're discussing.\"  Again, you're treating people with credentials and people without credentials like they're the same group.\n\n&gt;Except the argument's merit can very be based on passed experience. Something older people generally have more of.\n\n1.  Past experience, not passed.\n\n2.  No, the merit of the argument is the merit of the argument.  And an argument based on \"I'm old and in my experience X is true\" is a meritless argument.\n\nSecond Response: \nOne thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that skills tend to be less transferable then we assume.  A person who spends thousands of hours practicing and improving their ability to play chess doesn't actually improve their ability to remember strings of numbers.\n\nThey might be able to recite back the last 15 moves of the game they're playing, or have the entire board pictured in their head as they play blind folded, yet give them non-related memory tasks and they are no better then average.\n\nAnother thing that hasn't been mentioned is that when it comes to many skills, people tend to just stop improving after a while unless they put in deliberate effort.  The easiest example of this is typing speed.  People get better as they type more for a while, and then tend to stall at a relatively low speed unless they deliberately pursue something like typing lessons.\n\nWhen you say that age should automatically equal respect, you bake in the assumption that the older you are, the more experienced you are.  What you neglect to account for though is that experience may only matter in a relatively narrow set of situations.\n\nLet's say I own a bar.  If I ask my grandparents how I should market that bar, I'm sure they'll have opinions to give me.  If I ask a guy who has spent the last 2 years studying bar-marketing, he'll also have opinions to give me.  My grandparents have a lot more general life experience, but the marketer specializing in this field is clearly the better person to defer to.\n\nLet's say instead of a bar, I have a tech company.  We're a software-as-a-service outfit specializing in text-message based marketing.  If I ask a group of 60 year old advertising agency executives how to market this, and then I ask a group of 20-somethings who've been doing online marketing for 3 years how to market this, I'm likely to get very different answers.\n\nThe older advertising agency executives might have 30 years each in advertising behind them.  They've done radio, TV, direct mail, etc.  The younger web solutions group may only have 3 years each, specializing in cost-per-click, web copywriting, web design and usability.\n\nI think both groups would have important insights, but I would never ignore the younger web-focused group just because the ad agency has been around 10 times longer.  The younger group has more experience with situations very close to my problem, whereas the older group has general, broad-based experience but may or may not understand the nuances of this specific medium.\n\nSo how does this tie back into what your saying?  When it comes to ethical and personal choices, very few people deliberately practice to improve, and so I would expect people's talent there to peak at a relatively young age.  I wouldn't expect a 50 year old to automatically be a better authority on moral issues then a 25 year old.\n\nWhen it comes to business or work decisions, although people gain a lot of experience in a certain set of situations, I'm not convinced the skills gained 'transfer' as much as we intuitively believe.\n\nGiven all that, there is some merit to the idea that you should only automatically defer to older people in some area if they have a legitiment claim to closely-related expertise.\n\nNow young people who have no closely-related expertise are in a similar no-automatic respect situation, and if your going to be working together, there is a strong argument to be made that if they don't know very much, they should defer up the hierarchy.  But that's not an age based deference, that's a position based deference.  That's not so much due to some owed respect, rather that is the case for efficiency reasons.  If everyone argues with their supervisors whenever they kind of vaguely suspect they know better, then they will waste a lot of time and energy doing non-productive things.  Even if the more junior person is right, if the issue is such a marginal one as to make no real difference, then it's not an issue worth bringing up.\n\nedit: To quickly add to this, the times I've most often witnessed blatant disregard for the respect deserved to a position was in university classes when mature students were present and monopolizing a professors time during class, and work situations where a younger person is supervising an older person.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To compare the two responses:\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** adopts a critical and somewhat confrontational tone, engaging directly with points made by the original poster.

{"index": 70, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Coupes and manual transmissions are both novelty/useless items.\n\nOriginal Post: \nEdit: I get it. In adverse conditions manual will triumph over automatics, and in certain hill situations along with easy repair and longevity. I don't see many compelling arguments for coupes other than they look cool or may be easier to park in places you wouldn't want to be driving anyways.\n\nEconomy coupes used to be a budget choice for younger people who didn't need the space, so auto companies can also save money on two doors. Marginally better gas mileage may be an incentive as well. High end luxury sport car manufacturers can argue that the coupe offers better aerodynamics/lower weight to improve performance and handling.Today, coupes cost the same if not more than the same model sedan. I don't believe a slimmer profile can noticeably improve performance in an economy 140HP car, similarly, I find the fuel economy improvement from 30 to 32 mpg hard to justify the loss of two doors at the same price.\n\n \nAutomatic transmission performance used to be inferior to manuals, and an expert could handle a car with manual significantly better than an auto. Today, the highest performance cars come with automatics, and manual often isn't an option anymore. Even in models that offer both, the 0-60 and quarter mile speed is quite a bit better in the automatic, which offers \"manual shifting\" anyways. \n\nI believe that their long history and inferior counterparts has created a aura of superiority over automatics, similar to the Stradivarius violins. Due to production quantities, a manual transmission costs the same as automatic if not more.\n\nThis leaves me with only a few situations where one would practically want a coupe:\n\nHigh end 400-500+ HP sportscars which accelerate and go fast enough that the profile and marginal weight makes a difference.\n\nAnd for manual transmission:\n\nOld classic imitation cars for the nostalgia?

{"index": 71, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: X is better than Y\n\nOriginal Post: \nClearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. \n\n1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to \"why.\"\n\n2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in \"ly\" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.\n\n3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. \n\n4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). \n\n5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. \n\n6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. \n\n7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. \n\n8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even \"American History X.\"\n\n9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, \n\n10. = X. \n\n11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states.

Pronunciation: yeah you can talk about the letters themselves, but what about when you have to use them? X is a harsh sound, demanding it's attention and rarely allowing for subtlety. Y's only whiny in one of its usages. Since it has several different sounds it can be used in a number of different ways, often to accentuate the sounds of other letters.\n\n2. Exclusivity: X is a much more difficult letter to use. It's less common because the words it are used in are usually fairly specialized. Yes, Y takes a lot of credit for being in the \"-ly\" alliance, but I want to see you go a day without using Y. I can go a day without using X\n\n3. Consistency. X is always a consonant to its detriment. Y is the only letter that's both a consonant and a vowel, allowing it to be applied to a significantly greater number of contexts. It's useful. X has to sit out and wait on its turn while y is readily available when I needs to take a breather.\n\n4. Scrabble. X has caused more scrabble fights than Y ever will, and as someone else has said, it's twice as hard to find a use for the letter\n\n5. Math. Yes, x is always the first variable, but it's not like y is that far behind. And x may be the consistent axis, but the variable y axis is where the really interesting stuff comes up. In a simple graph relating distance over time, yeah the time is important, but we're really interested in how far the object traveled, which is the value on the y axis.\n\n6. Appearance. Ok, tbh, I agree with you here\n\n7. Sex. I got nothing here. Point for X\n\n8. History. I did a quick Wikipedia search on the presidents. 12 of them had y in their names, including John Quincy Adams, Ulysses Grant, and Harry Truman. The only president with X in his name is Nixon.\n\n9. Versatility in other areas. I'll grant that we use X significantly more outside of writing, but I will point out that these are generally negative connotations and that Y's extreme versatility as a letter likely outweighs X's advantage here.\n\n10. Apparently Y was not an original Roman numeral, so point to X.\n\n11. No one has ever been born or fallen in love in a state beginning with the letter x either. EDIT: yeah I forgot about Texas and New Mexico too\n\n12. If we're talking about unknown items, we can also say \"X is worse than Y\"\n\nHaha this was fun :)\n\nEDIT: \n\nLetter count: Use CTRL+F to see the massive discrepancy between X usage and Y usage in this thread alone. \n\nSecond Response: \nOkay, let's set some things straight here. \n\n&gt; Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to \"why.\"\n\nThe question \"why?\" is reflective of a thirst for a deeply analytical understanding of something. Questions like \"what\" and \"who\" are so simple and provide so little information. \"Why,\" on the other hand, is a question which yields a far more informative, useful, and powerful response than any question of the same family. \"Why\" isn't whiny. It's conducive to knowledge. Hence, the pronunciation of the letter Y is better than X simply *because* Y sounds like why, and why is a powerful question. Much more powerful than any pronunciation of X.\n\n&gt; Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700\n\nSince when does lack of usage make something cool? To me, it makes something really lame. For example, who wants to hang out with the kid that no one wants to hang out with? Who wants the broken bike nobody wants to ride? Who wants the flat basketball no one wants to use? In my experience, if people aren't using something, then there's a reason. That reason is probably because they don't like it or don't find it cool. Ask the iWatch how cool it feels that no one wants to use it. What about Zune? Everyone I know loves Zune. So much, in fact, that absolutely none of them use it! As you can see, people don't use things when they suck, as is the case for the letter X. Y is used in more words because Y is a significantly more fun letter to use. X isn't used as much because it's a tricky little bastard that doesn't lend itself to be used. X is like a really smart douche bag. He/she could be really useful if he/she wasn't so fucking tough to work with. Douche bag X\n\n&gt; Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind.\n\nBecause everyone knows that lack of variety is the spice of life! At least for me, I love watching the exact same TV show episode over and over again. So consistent and fun. Conversely, Y is a wild dude. He doesn't wanna get tied down with one or two different tasks. He's a peacock that needs to spread his wings. And peacocks are cool, man. So much coolers than X. In fact, [a recent study by Harvard](http://reddit.com) proves that peacocks are up to 5 times cooler than X with half the trans fat. Ball's in your court, X.\n\n&gt; Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4).\n\nThis reminds me of a Dimitri Martin skit. I'm going to misquote it but you'll get the gist. \"I was sitting on this air plane when I heard this guy say to his friend, 'Man, I'm really good at checkers.'   That's like sayings, 'Man, I'm not good at a lot of things.' \"      This is exactly what X is doing here. Scrabble is super lame. On a scale of \"Full House\" to \"Greg House\", Scrabble is like a \"Roseanne.\" (Nick@Night references) Consequently, X needs to brag about something, but X pretty much sucks at everything and has to brag about Scrabble. Poor guy. Y doesn't need to be good at Scrabble because Y is good at stuff like getting checks and getting sex.\n\n&gt; Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. \n\nYeah, but in math, Y is usually the dependent variable. Now, I know what you're thinking. \"But Bongloads4breakfast, independence is so cool. Just look at the United States. They declared that shit and they're pretty cool.\" This is the product of hegemonic capitalism and its social constructs. It's better for everyone if people become dependent on each other. If everyone is dependent on one another, then everyone has a reason to be kind to one another. You wanna know what's cooler than independence? Kindness.  \n\n&gt; Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze.\n\nBull shit. Bull FUCKING shit. You know what looks exactly like Y? Just about every tree that exists. Trees withstand strong breezes all the time with no problems. On top of that, trees provide oxygen for us. Y = Trees = Oxygen &gt; X which also means Y &gt; X. This isn't groundbreaking. This is simply arithmetic. \n\n&gt; Sex.\n\nI remember somebody telling me that JFK only lasted one minute in bed with his wife. You know why? JFK didn't have time to waste. Y has to be out there pumping out oxygen all day. As far as I'm concerned, I'd much rather have oxygen than sex. \n\n&gt; History. Malcolm X\n\nMalcolm X is pretty cool. Definitely one flaw in my argument would be that Malcolm X is cool. However, the Beatles are far cooler than Malcolm X. I'm pretty sure that's a given. Guess what the Beatles sing. YYYYYYYellow Submarine. So the much cooler Beatles like using the letter Y which, ipso facto means that Y is cooler. \n\n&gt; Versatility in other areas.\n\nY can also function as one of the most basic yet insanely strong questions \"Why\".

This contrasts with the more analytical and somewhat formal tone of the first response, which, while still engaging, lacks the same emotional resonance and humor.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response utilizes rhetorical questions, satire, and analogies that effectively engage and entertain the reader. Pithy comparisons (e.g., likening X to a \"tricky little bastard\" or a \"smart douche bag\") create memorable points that challenge the original post\u2019s assertions and encourage the original poster to reflect on their stance. In contrast, the first response focuses more on direct counterarguments and lacks the same level of creativity in phrasing.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response references and pokes fun at the original poster\u2019s points while capitalizing on absurdity, which likely resonates more. The original poster's acknowledgment of creativity in responses suggests that engaging humor could have positively impacted their view. The first response is more clinical and defensive, focusing on providing counterpoints without as much engagement in humor or personality.\n\nOverall, the second response's playful tone and clever use of analogies likely made a more significant impact on the original poster's perspective, encouraging them to see the merits of Y versus X in a fun and engaging way.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 72, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The best strategy on Cutthroat Kitchen is to dogpile.\n\nOriginal Post: \nCutthroat Kitchen is a reality TV cooking show where contestants bid on sabotages to make their competitors fail at cooking the dish that needs to be cooked, and keep the money remaining.  Often, this requires picking a competitor who gets sabotaged.  E.g. \"One of your opponents will give up all their ingredients and have to make their tacos using just what they can recover from this day old salad bar.\"\n\nThis view is about what the best strategy for handing out a sabotage is.  I think that in the first 2 rounds, when you have a choice, you should always target whoever already has a sabotage.  So if someone gave another competitor the salad bar, and then you're handing out who has to give up all utensils for tinfoil, you should always pick the person who got the salad bar.\n\nThe reason is this: you do not win a round of CTK.  You just refrain from losing.  Having the best dish is no better than having the second or third best dish in round one.  You are best off by trying to guarantee one person fails totally.  Because then they go home.\n\nSpreading out the sabotages means its less likely that they'll be crippling (since they're tested to be doable).  If you pile them all on one person though, it becomes much more likely they'll totally fail, thus saving you.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Sometimes this may override the advantage that dogpiling provides. \n\nThat said... it really depends on what the sabotages are. I don't think there can really be any one perfect strategy that doesn't depend on specific situations.\n\nJust to use a contrived example (but one which I have seen occur): One of your opponents forgot to get eggs in a baking challenge. You have a sabotage that removes someone's eggs. Under no circumstances should you give your sabotage to that person, even if they already have 2 sabotages assigned to them. Dogpiling would be the worst possible strategy in that situation.\n\nThere are many similar examples, such of them more subtle, such as someone that has already lost their knives being given a second sabotage that takes away ingredients that need to be cut, and replaces them with precut ingredients of lesser quality. \n\nAlso, much of the time, the \"dogpile\" strategy doesn't really help, because very often the first sabotage equally effects all of your opponents. So at the very least, an *additional* strategy is needed beyond just \"dogpile\". And it's never helpful on the first sabotage.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think its best to skip buying sabotages in the first round and save money for the later rounds. I've seen people blow their money too early and have no way to defend themselves in the later rounds. Also you help avoid revenge sabotages, the first round can be such a crap shoot and while the dogpile might ensure one person leaves, you don't know if you've dogpiled a strong chef or a weak chef and wasted money.\n\nNow in the second round I could see this working. If you and the third chef realizes that chef #2 is very strong and adaptable, dogpiling chef #2 would be a solid strategy.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the First Response's balanced tone and emotional approach, which acknowledges the original poster's (OP's) argument while introducing a nuanced alternative strategy.

{"index": 73, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I don't think I should spend every waking hour of my teenage life trying to get into a good college\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'm a really bad student, like a really bad student.

I understand perfectly where this will get me, but I am simply not willing to throw all my time and energy into things I see as unnecessary. \n\nDon't get me wrong I'm not some party high schooler, quite the opposite really. I am an all honors student with many AP classes that I have been scheduled to take next year after taking one AP class this year (sophomore year). I don't waste my time with things I see as trivial and slowly school has turned into something I see as trivial. Instead of doing my school work I spend timing learning how to program or watching a documentary on issues in this world. I write, I read, and I just try to learn everything I can but just not at school. I feel like I need the freedom to choose what I do and when I do it and I am just not allowed this with school.\n\nEvery morning I wake up at 6:45 sit through painstakingly boring classes with rare highlights as there is just one or two classes I can somewhat enjoy. If there's a test it's a 50/50 that I'll turn it in half blank and if it's a lecture or some other activity I'll tune in only once awhile to get the gist of the lesson. I sometimes look around to my peers and see people with 4.0+ gpa's who are completely focused on school. I see them during free periods doing all the work assigned and I see them get mad when they get 2 points taken off. When I see this I can appreciate the effort, but at the end of the day there are literally thousands of other people just like them. Every school in the country has a couple valedictorians who will all be competing to get into the \"best\" colleges and a majority of them will not make it.\n\nI think I understand the importance of college and I feel like I would excel at some of the top university, but as of now I not chasing that 4.0+ gpa required to get there and I don't see myself doing that anytime soon. I love to learn, I really love to learn and I teach myself new things I find interesting and useful everyday. That passion continues grow but it's pushing me away from going to the best colleges which I have been told will allow me to achieve the things I want to do. So please tell me why I should need to get that 4.0+ gpa and go to the best of the best of colleges. I want to help the world, but I'm not sure I'm going about it in the right way.\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the advice guys.

University will be a lot of the same boring stuff it is now. Sure there will be tougher and more interesting content but there is still a lot of meaningless requirements you will have to do.\n\nAlso if you really feel this way you need to discard the notion that school is for learning useful information. Especially at the high school level it is about learning how to learn. And that includes actual proper work ethic.\n\nDon't get me wrong. No one is saying you have to put 24/7 into your schoolwork to get good grades. Sure the valedictorian will probably be someone that did but that doesn't matter. A lot of top universities are looking for more \"rounded\" students anyways. But there is a huge gap between going all out and putting in no work at all. Heck just do the minimum. Putting no work into your education means no one will put work into you and help you succeed. You think having good ap scores and such gets you into a good school by itself? Not without good recommendations. \n\nThere's still time to change. If you think that getting into a good university is a worthwhile endeavor you need to get your act in gear.

I'm going to be brutally honest with you in hopes you'll change your thought process and make you realize you aren't the shining star of intelligence and superiority you think you are.\n\nI was in your shoes in high school.  I saw people around me busting their ass for good grades, struggling with exams, participating in extra-curricular activities, all in efforts to get into a good university.  I could skate by in high school by doing the bare minimum, ace exams without studying, and after having my ego inflated by teachers over the years I simply felt I was better than everyone else.  It couldn't be further from the truth and I learned this slowly through my years at a university while meeting people not only more motivated than me, but smarter than me as well.\n\nIt's easy to have a sense of superiority in high school which you clearly have by saying you'd excel at a top university when you can't put in the basic time and effort to complete basic high school responsibilities. \n\nSuccessful individuals aren't people who are smart with a thirst for knowledge.  They're people who are not only smart, but driven in ways you couldn't possibly fathom.  Successful people have motors.  They do what needs to get done, regardless of how they feel about the task.  There is no task that you are above - you've earned nothing thus far.  Regardless of what you decide to do in life, you'll be met with tasks that seem menial and unnecessary. Successful people will take these tasks in stride with a grin on their face because they know it leads them to the end game they're trying to achieve.\n\nYou're a smart, well spoken person. That isn't worth a fucking dime if you can't apply it and get work done even if you can't stand the work.  You have a choice, continue to slack in key parts of your life that can lead you to rewarding success, or you can lead your life thinking you're above school work and useless tasks.  One will result in a rewarding, challenging, successful lifestyle regardless of financial success.  The other will end with a narcissistic adult thinking they're owed something because they can program in their parent's basement but can't put in the work ethic to provide value to anyone.\n\n**If you want to get motivated and get your shit together to pursue a rewarding lifestyle and get out of this giant mistake of a hole you're digging, PM me.

{"index": 75, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:I feel uncomfortable with my hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've been born and raised in Turkey and last 2 years of my high school in Dubai. Although not strictly regulated on islamic laws, the culture of these places are far from north american culture. You're expected to not reveal too much when dressing. I completely understand that everyone has the right to dress how they want to but I just don't feel like if you are giving yourself to your SO then you shouldn't let others see your body.\n\n To me it is just a very special thing between two people to let the other person see and explore each other that no one else has. Too much cleavage or wearing no bras with thin shirts that let you clearly see the nipple and then she hugs other people makes me feel very uncomfortable. I would love to change my view, as I stand by the right that anyone can wear whatever they want, but this idea is just so integrated in my head after all my life living in it that I can't seem to shut it off\n\n\nFirst Response: \nOkay OP, I might have an answer for you. If you truly want to change your view it's going to take a while and even then it might still not be fully changed.   \nSo you say you believe that people should be able to wear what they want. That's good, as all people should have that right. Now the biggest issue that you have with it is that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Now I can't make you not feel uncomfortable seeing your hypothetical girlfriend wearing revealing clothing outdoors, only you can.  \n  \nBeing uncomfortable with what your SO wears I think stems from jealousy. You feel that only you should have the right to see that part of your SO. But that's not how the world works these days. You need to invest some trust into your hypothetical SO and realize that you're the only man she wants to be with. Now why would a person with a SO wear revealing clothing? Because it could just be there style, or it makes the feel good about themselves. But you need to try and not be so possessive of your hypothetical SO, they are a person too and they are going to do what they want. And if you're dating someone you should have enough respect for them to let them wear what they want, because when it comes down to it you don't control their actions.   \n  \n  \nNow to change your feelings, the only solution that I have for you is honestly, to buck up. Changing an opinion that is ingrained into you culture is incredibly hard, but it is possible. I had to change how I felt uncomfortable with wearing certain things or discussing certain topics. And though it felt wrong when I did it, the more I kept at it the less wrong it felt. And about after 4 months I found that my feeling on the matter had changed. So if you want to change how you feel, you have to let your SO wear what they want. And if you don't want to change that's fine, but I personally would find an overly jealous SO to be undesirable.    \n    \nHope that helps!\n\nSecond Response: \nFirst of all, this is not a VIEW.\nYou would never say to your girlfriend, \"You should not wear revealing clothes\". You seem like a rational guy. [Otherwise why would you be here?]\n\nIt is a feeling of discomfort, due to inexposure to women wearing such clothes. There was a time when I was uncomfortable with the idea of having a girlfriend who has had sex with someone else.\n\nRemember, our sexuality is not a commodity that we withhold to reveal to our 'special partner'.

That's how special you are!\", it makes for a great, romantic, childishly sweet 'made for each other' story for the couple, and it gives off a vibe of the relationship being 'truly cemented and committed', like a physical sign of love - [kind of like having a child together as a sign of love]. But YOU decide what your sign of love will be - the sight of her body, or your heart. These rules are not made in heaven. These perceptions are man-made. So YOU decide what you owe to each other.\nThat 'commodity', is the heart. And the heart only.\n\nWhen she makes love to you, tells you that you matter the most to her [besides other really important people like parents maybe], that she wants to grow old with you, have a child that is part you and part her[ain't that special?], kisses you on the forehead, lets go of all inhibitions and opens her world to you, THAT, is the special thing you want. \n\nWhen a women hugs someone, she is NOT thinking about her sexuality. The person who is getting hugged, is NOT thinking about her sexuality. So why should you worry?\n\nTry watching videos of strong-minded women who look like they really love their partners but wear 'skimpy' clothes. You will realize that a woman is so, so much more than her thighs and cleavage.\n\nAnd remember - most probably only you will get to see her naked when and during she is in love with you.

Without the Sunni/Shia divide, or many of the upheavals of the Arab Spring, ISIS as we know it wouldn't have happened.  \n\nBut without the invasion of Iraq (which in many ways precipitated the Arab Spring) it wouldn't have happened either.

Of course not.  But would it be what it is now without him?  Doubtful.  A strong Saddam and a strong Assad would probably have prevented it from happening.\n\nCould Obama have prevented ISIS?  Sure, but at a cost that I don't think we'd have wanted to pay, in terms of military and money.  He didn't cause it, but I think if the US were willing to ignore world (and domestic opinion), it would have had the means to stop them.

Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering?  I personally believe life is meaningless.  When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living?  \nThe only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you.

This is not a choice, but central to who we are as sentient beings. In reality there is no singular you that persists through time. You are the result of many processes interacting and constantly changing and evolving. The string that ties all of this together into an identity is the life story that you tell yourself.

{"index": 78, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: To push the other person off the bridge is the correct solution to the trolley problem.\n\nOriginal Post: \nFor those who don't know, the trolley problem is this:\n\nYou and another person are on a bridge which is over a trolley track. 5 people are tied to the track, and the trolley is coming. You may either push the other person off the bridge, which will stop the trolley before it hits the 5 people, which will kill that person, or you can do nothing, which will kill the 5 people. I add the rule that the trolley will not stop if it hits you, and will only stop if it hits the person with you, which eliminates the \"I'll jump myself\" answer and keeps the idea of the scenario in place.\n\nI believe that the proper solution is to push the person off the bridge. The purpose of the problem is to present a dilemma between utilitarianism (benefitting the most people in the best way) and deontology (doing one's duty in life as in following basic principles), but I do not believe that doing nothing and allowing the 5 people to die is ethical under either mindset. By neglecting to push the other person off the bridge, you have prioritized your own moral standpoint over the lives of not just one, but 5 other people. The idea that one should not kill may be generally applicable, but to effectively condemn other people to die because you do not want to compromise your morals is incredibly selfish, and goes against the implied deontological principle that one should prioritize the needs of others over one's own (especially if one's needs are really wants). In general, I believe that a failure to take a potentially immoral action to prevent an injustice due to the action being potentially immoral is selfish and unjustifiable.

{"index": 79, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I think a 'twist' in a movie, however well done, is a cheap (but nevertheless amusing) way to appear 'smart' (SPOILERS)\n\nOriginal Post: \nA multitude of films have twists in the plot, for example Gone Girl, Memento, a lot of films of M. Night Shyamalan, the Usual Suspects, Shutter Island, Fight club, well I can go on and on. [Here is a list of 100 twists](http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070836741/). \n\nIt usually consists of a plot that advances, but with hidden information not completely revealed yet. When the information is revealed, it will heighten the liking of the plot. It feels 'Mind blowing', the movie instantly goes deeper, it is suddenly a more complex movie, and twists are ideal for deep analysis and allegories. \n\nAdding a twist to a plot can make it everyone say 'Wow' and that one guy say: 'I knew it all along'. \n\nI think an analogy of showing why people like this so much, because it is abit like being in the plato's cave and then suddenly showing the light and deeper meaning. \n\nHowever, and this is my point, it is a simple and cheap way to make the movie much smarter than it initially was. I think there is also a high amount of plot twist movies in the IMDB top 250 (By no means a standard, but a good representative what is liked by movie-goers). Adding a well written plot twist makes a movie ripe for people to laud it, even though it is done to dead.\n\nBasically my point is that it is a too simple way to make a movie 'smarter' and an overdone method of 'blowing peoples minds'. It instantly adds points for movie-goers. \n\nAs I said in the title, my point is not that is a non-amusing 'plot device'. But it is a simple way to add layers in a movie. \n\nWhile watching a movie myself I always seem to like a twist (I thought Gone Girl did this very well and it sincerely surprised me) but afterwards when I am out of the cinema and more rational again I think 'hmm, just another twistmovie'. And apart from the twist nothing really interesting going on.\n\nA well regarded movie where I didn't like the twist was 'The Usual Suspects'. The cinematography and acting was obviously well done, but only looking at the plot I thought it wasn't impressive taking away the twist. I am probably triggering now a couple readers, for that I am sorry. However this is not a critique of this movie, but more of an example.\n\nI also think this is the reason why M. Night Shyamalan was so well recieved in the start of his career and now he is way less regarded than at that time. Because he does it all the time, and then it surfaces that it is a cheap movie 'plot device'. If he did it only once or twice people wouldn't have noticed it significantly. \n\n(I am sorry for spelling mistakes, I am not a native speaker)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

A twist fails completely when it is predictable. When the story is built in a way that makes you think something is going to happen; but in fact, something you never expected occurs, you feel more engaged in the story because it is legitimately unpredictable. There's a reason twists aren't typically revealed until halfway or three quarters of the way through a movie, and that's because a twist revealed too early has no time to subvert your expectations-while one revealed too late has no legitimate impact on the rest of the story. \n\nNo doubt some movies use twists to try to appear \"smart,\" but it has an actual purpose from a storytelling perspective in keeping things atypical. \n\nSecond Response: \nA good twist is really hard to pull off, because it has to walk a very thin line. If it's too predictable, then it's not a twist at all; if it's not predictable enough, then it's just going to seem silly (e.g. If, for example, LOTR had a plot twist where Sam was actually Saruman in disguise the whole time, absolutely no one would see that coming - but that's because it's a bloody stupid idea that makes absolutely no sense).\n\n\nSo pulling a twist off well is a matter of feeding the audience just enough foreshadowing that they have an idea of what's coming, but not so much that they're bored when it actually happens. In other words, a good twist feeds more off suspense than surprise.\n\n\nI would say that The Usual Suspects is an example of a bad twist. It's a twist that ends up invalidating a good chunk of what you've seen. In other words, it's a twist that reveals that the movie has been lying to you. \n\n\nIMHO Inception is a better twist, because it relies more on suspense than surprise. The possibility of being trapped in a dream is raised quite a few times. This sounds a few bells in the audience's mind: \"Okay, not being able to distinguish between dreams and reality seems like a major theme here, that'll probably be relevant to the plot later.\" So we have a sense, a feeling, that maybe Dom is more embroiled in this world of dreams than he thinks. When we learn about what really happened with his wife, or see the top spinning at the end, it's a good twist because it's something that's been germinating in our minds for a while. We look at that and say \"Aha! I knew that would come into play somehow, I just didn't know how or when.\" \n\n\nHitchcock often spoke of the value of suspense over surprise. One of my favourite examples of this is him discussing a bombing. If you have a five minute scene where two people are having a conversation at a table, then a bomb under the table explodes, the audience is completely shocked - but only briefly. If, however, you start the scene with someone planting the bomb then sneaking out, and during the course of the conversation cut to the bomb ticking down, then the entire conversation people are on the edge of their seats. The dialogue is cast in a whole new light, knowing that there's something about to happen. Moreover, it fuses in a bit of uncertainty: Will the bomb explode? Will they find it in time? If they find it, how will they defuse it? etc.\n\n\nA good twist is the same way. A twist that no one sees coming is a bad twist. Everyone's shocked when it happens - for about thirty seconds. A good twist is one that is slowly and gradually introduced, to build suspense. People are fairly certain that something will happen, but they don't know how, or why, or when. \n\n\nFor example: Betrayal. You've got a film where a group of people are working to accomplish something. One of the people on the team is a traitor. A bad twist is one where, at the climax of the film, the traitor is suddenly revealed. A better twist is one where we find out part way through the movie that there's a traitor on the team, but we don't know who. This is still revealed at the end, but we spend the rest of the movie thinking \"Hmmm, okay how and why will the betrayal happen? Who will be the traitor?\" Everything is cast in the light of this knowledge that someone is going to betray the rest of the team. We may guess right, we may not, but either way (if it's a good movie) we're on the edge of our seats right up until the last minute, waiting to find out the exact circumstances of the twist we already kinda know.\n\n\ntl;dr A bad twist is something that takes us by complete surprise; a good twist is one that provides new context, nuance, and depth to the rest of the movie.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses, we can break down various stylistic elements while keeping in mind their high Jaccard similarity.\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** employs a straightforward and slightly didactic tone.

It's a tautology. The reason we have safety net programs is because we want the right people in the right jobs.\n\nThe types of jobs that publicize position vacancies to programs that focus on job placement are usually minimum wage and temp positions, bottom of the barrel type jobs where the employer isn't concerned so much with finding the right person for the position as a body to fill a hole.\n\nIf an accomplished accountant has a really unfortunate layoff when his company goes belly up, and can't find a comparable job for some time, it makes a hell of a lot more sense to give him a little cash to hold him over until he does find an equivalent position than to place him in meal assembly at Burger King where his skills will be completely wasted. \n\nAlso, if safety net programs were defunded to provide for job placement and education programs, what would the really unfortunate people who don't have a cent to there name do to feed and house themselves and their families while attending daily classes or waiting for job placement?\n\nSecond Response: \nThere's a perception that you can live \"comfortably\" on welfare, which would naturally decrease someone's drive to work.

Let's say you're a single person who is unable to work consistently because of a mental illness; not something that totally cripples you and makes you unable to leave the house every day, but something that causes you to suffer months-long bouts of depression or anxiety that make holding down a long-term job or building a career impossible.  Your resume is really bad because you've tried and failed to hold down a job for several years, which means it's hard for you to find work outside of a place like WalMart that will hire anyone with a pulse.\n\nSo, you apply for \"welfare.\"  It varies a bit based on where you are, but what you can expect to get if you apply for the whole package is:  \n- Food stamps, on the order of about $100 a month that can only be spent on unprepared food  \n- Housing assistance, which means cheaper rent (not no rent) if you agree to live in a neighborhood where people get robbed and assaulted on a regular basis and everyone is selling drugs  \n- Medical insurance, which will make your doctor's visits free but which will refuse to cover most non-generic prescriptions (remember, you're dealing with a mental illness that could kill you if you aren't medicated)  \n- Cash assistance, which is exceedingly difficult to qualify for and can go as high as $200 in some states, but averages more like $85.  Usually these require that you're on SSI to get.  \n\nYou're disabled, so you can also apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, right?  Well, you can, but you'll get denied.  You have to pay a certain amount into Social Security to qualify for the disability insurance, and if you've been mentally ill since you were a teenager there's no way you've held down a job that long.  What you qualify for is SSI.  SSI tops out at roughly $750 a month, and they will reduce that dollar for dollar with any unearned income you get, like if, say, your parents are allowing you to live rent free or buying you the occasional fridge full of groceries.  If you do manage to temporarily find work, that amount will be reduced by fifty cents for every dollar you earn, after a couple of small deductions.\n\nAdd on to this that every single one of these programs is separate.  There is no monolithic \"welfare.\"  These guys, and the food shelf, and any charity you work with will all want records and updates and details on your life.  If you do decide to make a try of un-fucking your life and get work, you will have to obtain and send out a half-dozen copies of your pay stubs to a half-dozen different offices, and a three-paycheck month or a single bonus check can devastate you.  These benefits take months to apply for, and if you lose them because you made too much money in one thirty-day period or saved up more than two grand (which can easily be wiped out by a single car repair bill) it can take as much as 90 days to get your benefits back.  During that time your already low income is cut.  You're eating one meal a day, you're letting your bills pile up, you're calling in favors and borrowing money from people who are already sick of you asking them for things.  Your friendships and family relationships get strained.  Your stepmother makes snide comments about how some people have to work for a living every time she sees you.  You get really stressed out and start having panic attacks, and lose your job because you're so stressed out from not eating.\n\nThen the cycle starts all over again.\n\nNobody would ever choose to live like that.  You get no luxuries, you get no rest.  People who can't get out of the system aren't rejoicing because they get a free ride.  They're spending every day staring at people driving new cars, going out to eat and buying each other video game consoles for Christmas, and going crazy with envy.  They want that.  They want kids, they want a career, they want a real life.  But they can never have it.\n\nIf they could do real work for a real wage, they would do it.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Analyzing both responses reveals significant differences in tone, emotional approach, rhetorical techniques, and engagement strategies.\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is somewhat dismissive and confrontational, providing a systematic critique of the original poster's views.

{"index": 81, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: In an intimate relationship, you have an obligation to satisfy your partner's sexual needs.\n\nOriginal Post: \nDisclaimer: I am in no way justifying, or condoning pressuring anyone for sex in any situation, in any way. That being said:\n\nWhat happens after the honeymoon period when one person still desires sex, but their partner has lost interest (commonly referred to as a [dead bedroom](http://reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms))?\n\nI think it's still the duty of the disinterested party to at least minimally fulfill the sexual needs of their partner, if sustaining the relationship is a priority. In bullet form, here's why:\n\n* Each partner in the relationship is the others' only source of intimacy and sex (assuming a monogamous relationship), therefore if one partner withholds sex, the physical needs of the other is not being met. What is ultimately a chore or an inconvenience for one partner is a physiological necessity for the other.\n\n* Compromise is fundamentally part of every aspect of a relationship, and sex is no different. I'm conflicted in my thinking on this point: No one should be made to have sex if they don't want to. However, both my SO and I do things for each other that we don't necessarily want to do because it's better for the relationship, or it makes the other happy. I don't believe sex and intimacy should be treated differently- it's reasonable to have expectations of sex as a requirement of the relationship.\n\nThoughts?\n\nFirst Response: \nYou make some really good points, OP. One thing to consider is that sex is not a physiological need, people go without it all the time. The benefits of orgasm can be achieved through masturbation, and the benefits of intimacy can be achieved through cuddling and other intimacy beside sex. If the partner also objects to cuddling and so on, then the high libido person can get this from people outside the relationship, just as a single person would. \n\nSecond Response: \nFirst off great job on this CMV it's not often I see people this committed to meaningful debate, especially on this subreddit it seems.\n\nI do believe you are wrong though if you're trying to say that your partner should feel responsible for satisfying your sexual needs. I would agree however that you share a responsibility with your partner to work out your problems in a way that you can both be happy with.\n\nSpecifically I would suggest jerking off or agreeing to have sex with other people.

Intersex people very obviously exist, that's just scientific fact.\n\nI'm having trouble understanding what exactly your view is, as I'm sure you'll understand seeing as you acknowledged that it's rather vague and complicated. But your use of the word 'spiritual' is intriguing and I think that might be where the 'problem' (if I can use that word) with your view is.\n\nYour use of 'spiritual' seems to imply that you see gender (as opposed to biological sex, although I disagree with that distinction for other reasons) as a *metaphysical* concept. This isn't the case, at least in most academic circles: it's a *social* concept. \n\nYou seem to have empiricist leanings, but I feel like you've taken that a step beyond what is reasonable: although there is something inherently anti-empirical about metaphysical or spiritual claims, and so an empiricist would be sceptical of them, you've extended this scepticism to all non-physical claims, which isn't reasonable since there's clearly plenty of social and mental phenomena which are empirical but not physical. Take art, for instance. It's pretty clear that there is no essential physical property to what we call 'art', but that doesn't mean we can't study art and make objective statements about art beyond its physical attributes (we can talk about the role of art in society, or the history of art, or what art is influential etc.)\n\nArt, then, is clearly an abstract concept in that it's not a physical concept. This doesn't make it 'not real', though. Do you see how there's a parallel with gender there? Or have I missed your view/this doesn't actually touch on what I assumed you were assuming?\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nSex is biological. Gender is how ones biology and actions interact with society. Gender exists, just as much as democracy and popularity. Each society over history has handled gender in different ways, and it changes over time. In the west for the past decade or so the view of gender had become increasingly compkex. As you pointed out intersex is a real thing, it is physically obvious sonething is in a gray zone there. Mental differences between sexes are just as biologically real, and the right conbo of hormones and developmeny history can lead to mixing of self perceived gender as well. \n\nFor most of history such people had to hide from persecution, but now in many places we can have real dialog. About it. This is hopefully leading to a society where people can live without fear or oppression regardless of their perceived or believed gender. Such change is still in transition, so there is still a lot of push to keep things going.

{"index": 83, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:As a society, we should not use public resources to cure or treat children with chronic illnesses.\n\nOriginal Post: \n* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators.

It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.\n\nTo look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. \n\nAs for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population. \n\nSecond Response: \nYou're treating life as if its \"value\" were easily quantifiable. \n\n&gt;&gt;\"I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.\"\n\nSo, ruling out the unlikely extremes, we can imagine that the vast majority of them would grow up to be \"regular\" or \"average\" people, correct? \n\nAverage people grow, explore, discover, make friends, they create, they produce, they share, they connect, they bond, they feel and illicit feeling. They have families, they make families, they love and they are loved. Assuming you don't come from a family of exclusively \"geniuses, and great innovators\" or \"Unabombers and sociopaths\", presumably you are, and are surrounded by fairly average people. How do you measure their value? If one were to get incredibly ill, and was unable to pay for the entirety of their care, would you consider them an unwarranted cost on society? Ought they simply be left to die for the greater good? What if it were your young son? \n\nYou have to understand that when discussing matters of life and death, money is not the correct language. The value of human life cannot be measured in dollars. It is measured in emotion, love, connections, influence...\n\nHave you never been impacted by another human being? How can you measure the impact and importance of a kind, positive person. That individual will walk through their life leaving positive impressions and effects all around them - like a wake behind a boat, rippling out and out, influencing the next person and the next, who then turns around and continues that outward spread. Have you never been effected by a warm smile, or a bit of small-talk?\n\nClearly, I disagree with the entire premise of your argument. I think it shows a profound lack of empathy, or better yet, any actual understanding of life and humanity. However, let's go on and debate this on your own terms. \n\nYou say that the cost of caring for these sick kids isn't justified by the potential of their being great successes, simply because the odds of that happening are too slim. \n\n&gt;&gt;\" I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump.\"\n\nYou are right that the odds are slim, however you are wrong to say that therefore \"the argument falls apart when we look at expected returns.\" Let's use your Einstein example. How does one quantify the monetary worth of a great scientist? Let's imagine that we had never had the contributions of Watson &amp; Crick. Without the discovery and understanding of DNA, where would modern medicine stand today? Is caring for 100 thousand \"average\" sick kids worth the preservation of 1 Watson &amp; Crick equivalent? I would certainly say so. \n\nLet's look at a businessman like Steve Jobs. How much wealth did he create in his lifetime? How many billions and billions of dollars were generated in the development, production, distribution and sales of his products? You say, \"he's 1 in a million,\" right? Well, let's imagine he's generated 10 billion dollars of wealth in his lifetime (rather conservative). Him being 1 in a million means that we could spend 1,000 dollars on each and every one of the other 999,000 individuals and we'd only just then reach his worth. Moreover, that's assuming that the other 999,000 people contributed *absolutely zero value over their entire lives*. \n\nThe other problem with your argument is that you seem to believe that great people exist in vacuums. Perhaps the sick kid you save is our next great scientist's little cousin. Perhaps his or her little cousin's perseverance, strength, or tragic death, has motivated and inspired our future scientist to do great things. Perhaps this sick child lives long enough to make friends in school. Perhaps he or she loves science fiction books and movies, and that interest rubs off on one of his/her friends who otherwise wouldn't have picked up this interest at such a young age. Perhaps that nascent interest in the wonders of science and its possibilities was *invaluable* in the formation of our next great scientist. \n\nThe bottom line is, trying to place a dollar amount on the value of a human life is hopeless. We exist in infinitely complex social environments, and even \"average\" people can be instrumental in the generation of massive, valuable changes in the world. \n\nAll that aside, we preserve the lives of ill children (or of any age), because someone loves them. They don't want to lose them. There is no dollar amount one can place on that. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post on using public resources for treating children with chronic illnesses, we will look into various stylistic elements such as tone and emotional approach, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure and readability, and how each engages with the original poster.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response**: The tone is formal and somewhat academic. It introduces philosophical concepts and utilizes a mix of logical arguments and ethical considerations. The emotional appeal is subtle, focusing on societal responsibility and the psychological effects of loss on society. Phrases such as \"a society that has less esteem in itself\" hint at an emotional consequence of devaluing lives, but it stays mostly within a logical framework.\n  \n- **Second Response**: This response has a more direct and confrontational tone. It engages emotionally by questioning the original poster's views and challenging the perception of life as a quantifiable commodity. It utilizes empathetic language, emphasizing love, emotional connection, and the ripple effect of individuals in society. The response starts with \"You're treating life as if its 'value' were easily quantifiable,\" directly challenging the original perspective and appealing to the reader's sense of humanity.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response**: The response employs logical reasoning and philosophical references to utilitarianism. It quotes Jeremy Bentham and discusses the moral implications of government action. It aims to present a systematic critique of the original post\u2019s arguments.\n\n- **Second Response**: This response utilizes a more visceral rhetorical approach by asking questions that evoke emotional reflection. It encourages the original poster to consider their views from different angles, like imagining a sick child as part of their own family or a collective society. By presenting scenarios and emphasizing emotional connections, it helps the reader grapple with the implications of their stance.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response**: The sentence structure is complex and formal, with multiple clauses that request careful reading and deep cognitive engagement. It may appeal to readers who prefer logical and academic discourse, but can also risk alienating those who might struggle with more complicated rhetoric.\n\n- **Second Response**: The sentence structure is more varied and accessible. It includes shorter sentences and invites the original poster into a dialogue, which enhances readability and relatability. The anecdotes and scenarios provide illustrations that may resonate more immediately with a broader audience.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response**: This response engages the original poster by addressing their arguments directly and providing a counter-argument, but it remains somewhat impersonal. It critiques their viewpoint without drawing a strong emotional connection or personal touch.\n\n- **Second Response**: The second response engages the original poster more intimately by posing rhetorical questions and appealing to their emotions. It challenges assumptions while inviting them to reconsider their view in a more personal context, increasing the likelihood of a genuine reflection.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Key Factor(s) Leading to Prediction\nThe second response is more successful in changing the original poster's view due to its effective use of emotional appeal, accessible language, and personal engagement. By inviting the original poster to empathize and reflect on the value of human life beyond monetary terms, it opens a space for reconsideration grounded in personal experiences and connections.

From this, it is my belief that a person cannot be actively compassionate in every day life when they have not experienced the falseness of self because the ego is the only self they are truly aware of.\n\nCompassion being defined as being able to possess a love for all beings that is as great as that for the self and the closest people in their lives.\n\nTruly compassionate being defined as actively compassionate in every day life for all those that they can have an effect on.\n\nFirst Response: \nBut why do you believe this?\n\nIt doesn't exactly seem well founded or explained in your post.\n\nWhy can a person who hasn't experienced egolessness be truly compassionate?\n\nWhy has your mushroomtrip or whatever made you able to be more \"truly\" compassionate then someone who hasn't?\n\nAre you (or others who can be truly compassionate) actively more compassionate then everyone else? Or is your quality of compassion better?\n\nAre there people who do more compassionate things then you, but have not experienced egolessness? Are they still \"worse\" then you even if they do more for some reason?\n\nSecond Response: \nIf we are to take something like Dunbar's Number seriously, that is, to assume there is a physical limit of our ability to understand the social connections between people known to the individual, then it follows that other socially-dependent concepts, like empathy and compassion, also have their limits, in that they can only be applied in their totality to a limited number of things. You are physically incapable of understanding and having compassion for *every single living thing*, rather, in order to have the compassion of the type you've defined, the individual must create for themselves an idea or representation that stands in place for that complete understanding. They must substitute what they do understand, which in this case is the \"love\" they have for themselves and those they do know, to fill in gaps for what they are incapable of understanding.\n\nWhat that means is that the person who is feeling compassion for all living things, as a matter of physiology, is in fact *not* doing such, as much as they are creating a heuristic for \"compassionate\" behavior. They love *the idea of \"all living things\"* because they cannot understand what \"all living things\" actually represents, much less have feelings for. This process is wholly dependent on the ego - a lack of self concept means lacking the ability to do that substitution.\n\nHowever, that leaves unanswered the question of whether a temporary suspension of the ego is necessary to create an effective heuristic for compassionate behavior. I argue \"no\". There is nothing to suggest, on a conceptual level, that the forming of such a pattern of behavior necessitates experiencing something like the \"ego death\" often attributed (though not exclusive) to LSD, Ayahuasca, dissociatives, etc.  It would seem to be the case that a supreme ego is necessary, one which is able to substitute for a lack of knowledge of others the knowledge of itself, and act as though it were interacting with a being of the same makeup. Temporary suspension may be *helpful*, but you haven't demonstrated any reason for thinking one is incapable of doing this kind of \"ego substitution\" without this experience. Rather, one could be a kind of narcissist/solipsist who believes all people are them, and exhibit the same behavior for which your view seems to aim.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post, we\u2019ll focus on their respective tones, rhetorical techniques, sentence structures, and how they engage with the original poster.\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone of the first response is confrontational and somewhat skeptical. The language is informal and critical, intended to challenge the original poster's ideas directly.

{"index": 85, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: (NSFW) One needs proper consent to masturbate about someone.\n\nOriginal Post: \nConsent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.\n\nIf we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.\n\nThis line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.\n\nSo please, CMV!\n\nEDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.\n\nThanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nA few things. Firstly, to assume that you could avoid thinking of a particular person during masturbation, even if you wanted to, is ridiculous. While humans can govern the content of our thoughts to some degree, you do not have the power to govern what you think 100% of the time. Even if you made the effort, often times trying to avoid thinking about something is the surest way to guarantee that you will think about it.\n\nFor instance, whatever you do, DO NOT picture a semi-automatic handgun right now! If you are like most people, you have already done so, as the suggestion itself plants the idea and the brain conjures up the image automatically. It doesn't require any effort on your part. There's no way to self-regulate this kind of thing, let alone have others regulate it for you (or even observe the process).\n\nThere are two different levels to consider this from. The first is plausibility. Your idea isn't practical, as it isn't something you could guarantee, even if you wanted to.\n\nThe second piece is that your suggestion above implies is that other people's thoughts about you are your business. I would argue that they are not. My thoughts about the world are a representation of my inner conditions, not yours, and I will gladly and happily think whatever I like about you and you will likely never know it unless I choose to act on those thoughts via word or deed. Most of our thoughts are really just background noise anyway and our thoughts have varying degrees of consciousness associated with them, so the degree to which you can attribute intent to particular thoughts is highly questionable.\n\nAnd what of intrusive thoughts? Intrusive thoughts are a phenomena whereby we have unplanned thoughts that are sometimes disturbing in nature that simply materialize and were not planned at all (like being near the edge of a cliff and thinking about jumping).\n\nWhile regulation of behavior is important, because it directly affects the well being of others livning in society, thought is neither something that you can fully control, nor something that directly affects the agency of another (unless we act upon such thoughts).\n\nSecond Response: \nLet's put aside your specific argument and just think about what's more important.\n\nThe role of consent in sexual relations isn't just there for its own sake, it's there to reduce harm and trauma in society. Consent is a basic function of an independent, free society where individuals can have autonomy over their own body.\n\nIn your first case, the boob staring is a border issue. By entering a public space, you are opening yourself to be looked at by other people. You have a reasonable expectation not to be *leered* at, but still, that's merely an expectation. Just like you have a reasonable expectation not to be called an idiot and challenged on every opinion you have upon first meeting someone, it's merely an expectation. It's part of the shifting social climate of etiquette.\n\nNow, in terms of your consent concept, I think it falls on several faces. First, in terms of a net harm, I think most women/men would agree that someone they barely know telling them they want to masturbate to them would be unsettling. If they were in relationships, it might affect their relationship, and perhaps their SO's relationship with this person. Since the masturbation icon is neither aware, nor directly affected by the act, and being informed of the intention is usually worse than being masturbated to, it follows that they better of the two options would be to not be informed about it.\n\nFinally, it's fundamentally unenforceable. Person A informs Person B they want to masturbate to them. Person B says no, that creeps me out, please don't. What happens next? Only Person A knows if they are honoring the request, and Person B is now given a nasty little reminder about this person every time they interact. Their thoughts might randomly drift to this person, where they then remember the request, and suffer anguish from not knowing if they honored the request or not. Even if they ask Person A, it's not like they can prove they haven't.\n\nSo, I get the general idea of your position, I just think it doesn't really apply all that well in practice. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more serious and philosophical tone, emphasizing the societal implications of consent and harm while addressing the broader context of the original post's argument. This approach aligns with the emotional complexity of the issue by appealing to the necessity of consent in a way that acknowledges societal norms and the protection of individual autonomy. In contrast, the first response primarily focuses on a defense of the inability to control thoughts, which, while valid, does not engage as deeply with the emotional weight of the issue.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response effectively uses reasoning and examples that help contextualize the discussion about consent within societal norms and potential psychological effects, thereby making a more compelling case against the original poster's suggestion. It raises counterarguments that address the practical difficulties of enforcing consent in personal thought while considering the implications for relationships and mental well-being. The first response relies heavily on logical constructs but lacks in emotional depth and engagement.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response directly acknowledges the specifics of the original post and extends the debate to broader themes. It provides constructive critique and demonstrates a clear understanding of the nuances involved in the original poster's reasoning. The first response, while addressing some logical inconsistencies, ultimately does not challenge the underlying assumptions about the relationship between masturbation and consent as effectively and comprehensively.\n\nBy examining these factors, it is clear that the second response more effectively engages with the original poster's argument and addresses the implications of consent in a manner that is likely to resonate with their concerns, thereby more successfully altering their perspective.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 86, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If anyone should replace Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill, it should be MLK Jr, not Harriet Tubman\n\nOriginal Post: \nFrom a legacy standpoint, AJ is probably the least deserving amongst the figures on American paper currency (Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, Hamilton, Grant, Franklin).  It's not like the guy didn't have good qualities or do good things while in office, but for a country that's trying to go in the direction of racial/ethnic inclusiveness, it's pretty baffling that the guy who's responsible for the trail of tears is on our currency.\n\nThat being said, I thought it was interesting to see in the news that people are trying to change who is on the $20 bill; however, Harriet Tubman seems like an odd choice considering the other possible candidates.  Off the top of my head, I think Teddy Roosevelt and MLK are the most deserving, and if I had to choose between them it would be MLK.  \n\nObviously, MLK's legacy speaks for itself, being the leader of the civil rights movement.  Compared to Tubman I just feel like MLK's impact was far greater.  His speeches and non-violent protests impacted the entire nation, millions of people, while Tubman saved ~70 people from slavery.  That's not to discredit Tubman because what she did was brave and important, and her accomplishments weren't limited to the underground railroad, but I think it's fair to say that MLK had a greater impact than Tubman, and therefore is more deserving to be placed on the $20 bill.  I might even go as far to say that it's not even close.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

I'm not saying that he doesn't deserve all the statues and holidays - he probably does - what I'm saying is that so many other people deserve a comparative amount of recognition.  Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, WEB Dubious, Booker T Washington, Ida B. Wells, A. Phillip Randolph, James  Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Nora Zeale Hurston, Ralph Abernathy, Fred Shuttlesworth, Diane Nash, John Lewis, Medgar Evers, Bayard Rustin and a 1000 others all deserve recognition for their efforts in creating a freer America. \n\nYet, it's always King we shine the spotlight. He already has monument on the national mall, a federal holiday, and [700 streets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_streets_named_after_Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.) named after him. Compare this to Douglass, probably King's most worthy competitor in most awesome orator/ in US history, who has like [four](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_things_named_after_Frederick_Douglass#Streets_and_bridges) streets *and* bridges named after him. Even if wikipedia is severely undercounting, it is still illustrative of this point. \n\nBy compacting the long march for freedom into one man, w've turned MLK into a mixture of a puppy dog and Jesus. He comforts us about America's trajectory on issues of racism. His memory assures us that the American Dream is not a lie for black people. That the promissory note has been cashed. In the popular memory, the United States had a problem with racism until MLK came and cleansed the America soul with his works and his sacrifice. By flattening the entire story down to one man, we not only forget the thousands (hundreds-of-thousands) other people who fought for civil rights from the founding of the country up until today. By erasing them from memory, we also erase the fact that so many people were needed to change the country. That our country was born with a cancer.\n\nFinally, honoring MLK is kind of a slap in the face to the man. Towards the end of his life he was fighting hard for so that the poor would have better access to wealth. I don\u2019t want to die and have to tell MLK \"millions of people still don't have money, but at least it's money with your face on it. \u3160\u3160\"\n\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI think this just comes down to *why* we want to put certain people on money. Are we going for the most famous? The ones who had the biggest impact, measured by total lives touched? Are we going for people of the best moral character, or the people with the most inspiring personal stories? Are we going for people whose story everyone already knows, or could we maybe use currency to spotlight heroes who don't get quite as much attention? Or should we just choose the best-looking historical figures?\n\nI'm not sure that \"impact\" or \"number of people helped\" should necessarily be the sole metric by which we choose people for currency. I'm not going to argue that Harriet Tubman had more of an impact on US history than MLK Jr., but I don't think that's the be-all and end-all of the discussion. I think there's something to be said for choosing someone who doesn't already have a holiday and a monument on the National Mall. And while MLK is certainly more impressive than the vast majority of figures out there, I think Tubman still has a more awe-inspiring personal story--she may have had less of an impact, but she also started as a slave. That's kickass. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the second response's nuanced discussion of the criteria for choosing figures to honor on currency.

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think this is the case for a lot of people. My boss friended me at one point, which I thought was awkward because whenever I'm in a leadership position I don't friend anyone because I don't want them to feel pressured into saying yes. Anyway. My boss used to talk to me (in person)about things I had posted online and events I had gone to, and it was almost like him seeing my Facebook made him feel like he knew me well and we were buddies. And I know I gave him access to that information, but I thought it was creepy that he cared.\n\nAnd that's what it comes down to. Yeah you are entitled to look through my post history, but WHY do you even care? I think that's what makes it creepy. \n\nSecond Response: \nYou haven't said anything inaccurate but I think you're missing why your example is creepy. The only time someone like that will freak out or be offended is if the picture or quote is from a while ago. It makes the other person think, \"why were they looking that far back in my profile\" or \"why do they remember that small detail\". It gives a slightly violated feel. As if your entire life was just examined and judged by someone. Social media is not a diary or a wikipedia about our lives. It's a way to stay in connect and \"speak\" to your friends instantly at any point in time. Before you mention that they shouldn't feel violated because they posted it, imagine someone listening to all of the things you've said publicly, on a recording device. Yes you said those things for the public to hear, but you don't enjoy the idea of somebody listening to all those things at once. When the youth post on social media, its like they are speaking casually to their friends. Internet based relationships are so imbedded in our lives that we don't give a second thought to the things we say online. So people can often times forget they even said the quote in question and it's off putting when someone brings up something you don't remember saying. People that \"stalk\" others profiles are also generally presented as creepy in TV/movies. When a person mentions a detail in someones Facebook history from a long time ago, it gives off a creeper vibe.\n\nHowever, in your example, if the picture or quote Frankie mentions is from that week, I doubt there would be any issue. \n\n**tldr: It's only creepy if the post is from a while ago.**\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a slightly more analytical and empathetic tone.

Also, I am going to be using Christianity as my reference religion, but other Abrahamic religions that contain the genesis story are applicable as well.\n\n_____\n\nThe theory of evolution that gives an explanation as to our origins I believe is not compatible with Christianity.

[Genesis 2:7]\n\nBut that does not mean that God could not have let humans evolve over millions of years, and then separately created Adam in a form that was similar to the form the evolved humans had. [Genesis 1:26]\n\nEdit: genesis citations.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; The Christian genesis story states that god created man in his current form, while evolutionary theory explains that life took millions of years to evolve and that our species is descended from a common ancestor with the other primates.\n\nYour mistake is assuming that your interpretation of the bible is the only one that is correct. An alternative interpretation is that God created everything in it's current form, but also created it in a *mature* form. It was made this way so that we can look at the world and discover how things will work from that point forward.\n\n&gt; If someone were to claim that only the genesis story is a metaphor but the rest is literally true, then that person has effectively filtered the bible themselves. For a person to pick and choose what is real and what is not in a sacred book is to not hold the book sacred. \n\nYou don't get to define the religion of another person. Seriously.

The Second Response, while offering an alternative interpretation, hinges on a more abstract view of religion as \"arbitrary,\" which could be seen as an intellectual dismissal rather than a substantive counter.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The First Response is succinct and clear, making it easy for the original poster (and other readers) to follow the argument.

Because, the way you're talking about it is sort of the way most people address this concept, like it's some sort of transcendent sentiment, that there's a purpose that can exist forever and we're not a part of it and that eternal purpose is the only important thing.\n\nBut, I mean, that's just some feeling that we have, like envy or boredom. \"Meaning\" the concept as opposed to \"meaning\" the feeling, as far as I can see, has no need to be attached or correlated to some arbitrary concept like \"time.\"\n\nYou know when you're sorta YouTube surfing and you start on some silly video and later end up on a 2 hour documentary on some huge scientific conquest we've done in the last decade sometimes? Or sometimes, it's the opposite, but often, you'll watch a video about puppies playing patty cake with cats and then suddenly **here's all the physics ever.** (EDIT: So re-reading this, I realized that at this part, I accidentally did it in the same order twice so it's not the opposite at all but I'm sure reddit will forgive me just like they forgave that one guy who misspelled his name)\n\nOne of those videos I watched, I think, was about what's outside our observable universe. It started out with stuff outside of what we can see because of expansion, and that was like \"meh\" because it was mostly, as far as we can tell, just our stuff, same composition, pretty uniform except for some cold spot that could be evidence of a multiverse or something. And then they started talking about the multiverse. And how there are totally different temporal dimensions that our temporal dimension exists in and how our \"forward\" in time is \"up\" one level up or some crazy arbitrary dimension.\n\nLike, you just sorta realize that time is **totally and completely arbitrary.** People put so much emphasis on time being such a huge thing, like if we don't last until the end of the universe in 10^gazillion millennia or whatever they calculated it to be, we don't matter, but no, it's just another arbitrary dimension, it's like saying that unless I'm really, really fat, I don't matter and I'm totally meaningless because I don't take up as much space in this dimension.\n\n###So...\n___\n\nBeing dependent on time is so, so arbitrary. Time is just a randomass mechanic that our minds just sorta found it convenient to interpret. I mean, everything about our universe is just interpretations. These colors are just radiation. There's radiation going directly into my eyes right now and some physical law has allowed a mysterious thing called consciousness to emerge from the soup inside my head to make what we call an image out of that. Time is like color, we're just looking at entropy and somehow, the evidence of less entropic states enters each of our consicous states in order to make memories.\n\nMy take on this is if there is a meaning out there, you wouldn't know. Meaning, as far as I can define it, is ability to have some sort of effect. I'm not sure if logic even exists outside of our universe, like I don't know if true and false are just suddenly not the only states of things outside here, but as far as I can tell, the best definition is having an effect, and when you have rigorous laws and logic, everything you do affects everything. The universe is just a structure, time included, just like a bunch of blocks you put together to make a Jenga tower that relies on every piece to stay up except Jenga is literally the opposite of that, but everyone always uses it as a metaphor for engineering so w/e. That's what Chaos theory is, if you change anything or remove anyone, suddenly the universe doesn't exist. It's gone. If someone from outside the universe came in and made you not exist, literally the ENTIRE UNIVERSE is gone. Aliens outside of our observable universe but still in our universe would just, without even knowing why, also stop existing because they rely on your existence.\n\nThat's fucking crazy, like, right now, some pregnant alien overlord is worried about their leadership and their baby and they're not worried about me at all, but if it weren't for me RIGHT FUCKING NOW being a thing, they would be freaking DEAD. They don't even KNOW.\n\nI'm not even sure I'm trying to change your mind at this point, I started typing and then I just got really enthusiastic, but yeah, you really should realize that\n\n###TL;DR (Honestly, don't read the above, it's a ramble because I fucked up and I'm too lazy to fix it)\n\n\"not lasting forever means we're meaningless\" is so super duper arbitrary when you realize how non-unique and special time is. It's just, like, another thing. Like a burger. It's like saying if I don't always have everything to do with this burger, I am meaningless, from cow to slaughter to consumption. Why a burger? Why not a sandwich? Or a late night television show? At the very least, if we're meaningless, it's not because we won't last forever.\n\nSecond Response: \n'Human existence is futile.' But to find meaning is what makes us human. To be an animal without hope of overcoming death is certainly meaningless.\n\nAs animals it isn't logical to think we were 'cursed' with the knowledge of our own future demise. \n\nWe fear death in the same way we fear pain: it motivates us to do something other than bang our heads against the wall. In order to escape the fear of death we seek transcendence; we raise children or create art to effect the next generation. Example: the 'mid-life crises' is caused by 1) getting older 2) feeling you haven't influenced the next generation positively. Some people try to 'make themselves feel younger' via sportscars, drinking, etc. which always fails.\n\nBeing a mere beast is futile.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To compare the two responses:\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** adopts a whimsical and rambling tone, infused with enthusiasm and a conversational style.

It probably won't occur to you to try, and if it does, you'll see that no one who is like you has succeeded and you might give up.

{"index": 91, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I believe there is no moral framework in which it is permissible to eat meat but not to have sex with animals.\n\nOriginal Post: \nEdit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no *consistent* moral framework\". The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate.\n\nA few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life.\n\nOkay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.\n\nConsider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam\n\nHow can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?\n\nI don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.\n\nAfter giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said \"CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them\" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

What's typically thought to be wrong about meat-eating is the suffering inflicted upon animals as part of industrial farming. If we were to reform our practices around meat-eating, however, and do away with these objectionable conditions, it's possible to to satisfy your first condition, to hold that eating meat is permissible.\n\nFor the second, we just need to hold, quite reasonably, that animals have rights against being harmed and that non-consensual sex is a harm. Both of these are pretty straightforward given how we view the torture of animals and rape.\n\nI suppose what puzzles you is the apparent tension between saying \"it's OK to kill an animal and eat it\" and \"but animals have rights against being harmed.\" This tension can be resolved if death turns out not to be a harm for the one who dies. Now this is actually a fairly tenable view. Consider some paradigmatic cases of harm: you break your leg, you're robbed, or you're psychologically abused. Something every case of harm seems to have in common is that the harm involves a comparison your state of being before and after the harming event. So when you break your leg you're worse off than you were before breaking your leg in virtue of the pain and hindered motion that you experience. If you're robbed you're worse off than you were before the robbing in virtue of being deprived of whatever was stolen. If you're psychologically abused, then you're worse off in virtue of the change in your mental well-being. So harm involves a comparison between how you were before the harming event and how you were after it. Given this comment element it's reasonable to define harm in comperative terms. So something like \"S is harmed by event X if and only if S is made worse off than they were with X having happened.\"\n\nNow when we try to conceive of death as a harm we run into a problem. Namely, there is no \"you after death\" to compare to. So before death you were x, y, and z, but after death you are non-existent. Since there's nothing to compare to, we can't count death as a harm on the comparative account that I gave above. Perhaps there's some other way to make sense of death as a harm for the one who has died or perhaps death is only bad for people who cared about the deceased and have had their own interests frustrated by her death. I'm not going to come down on either side of this debate here, but the latter is at least a reasonable approach to take and if it's correct then we can coherently say of animals that it's OK to kill them, but not OK to harm them.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nSecond Response: \nUnder the moral framework of rational self-interest, objectivism, virtue-value ethics, or Aristotelian ethics eating meat of animals is good because it gives us sustenance, and the *means* are justified as we have rights over beings that don't have the potential for free will or rational thought. Beastiality (as with rape or sex with a tree) is bad because it is an act that is self destructive i.e. self demeaning to the perpetrator (an act of destroying your own integrity). \n\nUnder this system, it's moral or immoral depending on the effect on the actor/eater/fornicator - rather than the effect on the actee/eaten/fornicated.\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is analytical and intellectual, focused on presenting a reasoned argument. The language is calm and seeks clarity, providing insights into the nature of harm and death's moral implications. The tone is respectful, which invites discussion without alienating the original poster.\n   - **Second Response:** The tone is more assertive and theoretical, engaging with moral philosophy directly.

It anticipates confusion, offering explanations to bridge gaps in understanding. The mention of paradigmatic cases of harm effectively builds credibility by grounding abstract concepts in relatable examples.\n   - **Second Response:** It employs specific moral frameworks to validate the position on meat-eating and bestiality. While it presents a philosophical stance, it assumes the audience's familiarity with terms and frameworks without adequately unpacking them, which may disengage some readers.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - **First Response:** The response is structured methodically, with clear transitions and understandable language. The paragraphs flow logically from one point to the next, which aids comprehension and retention of the argument.\n   - **Second Response:** This response features longer sentences with complex ideas explained rapidly. This dense structure may hinder understanding for readers not well-versed in moral philosophy.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n   - **First Response:** Directly engages the original poster through an exploratory dialogue, asking questions that prompt further reflection. The writer explicitly connects the discussion back to the original poster\u2019s concerns about harm and rights.\n   - **Second Response:** While it presents a moral rationale, it does not actively engage with the original poster's narrative or concerns.

Why should I get a say in how something that I don't pay for is run?  I could just vote myself more and more money without bearing any of the expense.  I lost my job last month and I\u2019m on unemployment.  Why should I get a say in how much money I get when I am living off the work of others?  This is just like when you are a child.  You don\u2019t get to make the rules because you aren\u2019t paying the rent, and you don't get to set your allowance.\n\nMoney is a medium of exchange it is received when you provide a good or service of value to someone, and spent when you take a good or service of value from someone else.  Therefore the more wealth you accumulate, the more net value you have provided to society.  These people should have more of a say in how our society is run because they have given it the most.  \n\nAlso this would be for the best since rich people are generally smarter and more competent than poor people, and would choose better politicians that don't just appeal to emotion.  \n\n\nFirst Response: \nOne of my favorite quotes from Rome \"... you know nothing of violence.

The brilliance of western democracies was constitutional protections to limit the power of even the majority to some reasonable boundaries that all can agree to and thus, even if the majority are in favor of a proposition, the constitutional values will sway popular opinion.\n\nMy point... It is important that Bill gates doesn't get more political impact than 100 million other people because, eventually, those 100 million other people would storm his house, kill his guards, and mount his head on a pike.\n\nJust look at how well feudal societies worked out in the past, and how well Russia is working out today.\n\nThe brilliance of western society is that we are all in this together and we all get to choose the country's course together.\n\nFinally...

I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The \"it's going to happen anyway\" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?\n\n\n\n\nOf those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'll rarely respect an argument against gay marriage, because that is discriminatively denying what should be a basic human right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. \n\nAbortion is a very complicated topic, though, and I can understand why someone would be against. Disliking the idea of ending a life before it makes sense is totally fair. I disagree with your position, but I get why you have it.\n\nAnd your opinion is not an asshole opinion. Unlike prohibiting gay marriage, banning abortion isn't trampling over liberties or discriminating. You could make the argument that it's telling a woman she isn't allowed to have control over her own body, but I'd argue that it doesn't reach the same extent. Now, this is certainly to a degree apples and oranges, and not the perfect comparison, but do you understand what I mean? Furthermore, you admit to yourself that you aren't in a position where abortion would matter to you. You know that you have a lack of perspective shaping your opinion. \n\nAnd just because you agree with Redditors on some things doesn't mean you have to agree with them on everything. They're *your* beliefs, and nobody can tell you that if you believe A, you have to also believe B and C. Sure, a party platform might indicate support for all three, but you believe what you want, regardless what other people have outlined. \n\nYou aren't saying women are subordinate beings. You aren't calling pro-choice people heathens. You aren't being a dick about your beliefs. They are thought-out, and you believe them for a reason. And there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nI disagree with it, but I won't attempt to change your view on abortion. But you *are* wrong about feeling like an asshole for it. \n\nSecond Response: \nI honestly don't know anyone who is pro abortion. It's a sad and traumatic thing to choose to do, and I'm not sure it's something I would ever choose for myself. \n\nBut not for one second do I think my choice not to have an abortion should affect someone's hard choice to have one.\n\nWhen is it okay to limit a woman's right to do as she wishes with her own body? \n\nA women's right to control her reproductive organs should not end the moment someone sticks a penis inside her. \n\nIt shouldn't end when he ejaculates, it shouldn't end just because she happens to be ovulating, or because an egg is inseminated. So when should her rights be limited with respect to her choice to abort the pregnancy? When should the rights of a fetus outweigh her right to choose her own destiny? \n\nObviously by the time she gives birth, that fetus has full rights to life. But when did they start? Did the child's rights to life gradually come into being, or were they switched on suddenly?\n\nI think that the fetus should only be deemed to have rights when it could theoretically survive even if the mother tragically died.  Only at this point do I see any point in supporting a fetus' rights. Before this it is too much a part of its mother to survive on its own and therefor too much a part of its mother to have rights separate from hers. \n\nSo do I support abortion? No. Do I support it being legal?

The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.\n\n  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.\n\nSo yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation. They are not actual non-profit organizations.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;  The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for\n\nThis is true and useful.  But only a tiny percentage of animals in zoos are endangered.  Also, *keeping them in zoos* renders them unable to live in the wild.  A far more effective, long term method of preserving endangered species is to protect the wildlife in which they live.\n\n&gt; either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. \n\nAnimals who are born, raised or otherwise spend long periods of time in zoos are no longer able to survive in the wild.  It's actually considered immoral to release them into the wild because they will die long before their ability to mate.  \n\n\n&gt; zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.\n\n\nIt is true that zoos bring animals closer to humans, but there isn't any evidence to show that humans are more caring of the wildlife environment as a result.  \n\n\n\nThough, mostly zoo life for animals is a lot like prison life for humans.  No one would argue that a human in prison is alive.  Or that it's not cared for.  Humans have food, shelter, entertainment and social structure.  But all of the things that make life worth living are gone.  The ability to build a family.  The option to find a mate.  The ability to build the things in our lives which we each assign value to.  Animals are not so different.  They might mate with another because they are incited to.  But they often have ideas of who they like or don't.  They cannot hunt their food in spite of an evolutionary drive to do so.  Also, often, the topic of animal depression is discussed in zoos where it would be nearly nonexistant in the wild.\n\nIt is the guarantee of *life* which is more than the wild offers.

For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction.

Can a person attracted to their sibling be only attract to their sibling? I mean, to really allow this, we'd have to distinguish fetish from sexual orientation. Can they have a relationship with anyone else, if they are of the gender the person is attracted to?\n\nA gay man could potentially marry any other gay man, right? The pool of choice is large and diverse. Whereas, the person who is attracted to their sibling can only marry those one or two people.\n\nGay marriage denial was a form of persecution due to sexual orientation, I think incest is more of a lifestyle application, maybe even one that might be impacted by life experiences: not having met any other X and having relationships with those individuals. If it is only due to proximity and lack of exposure, then it's not really a rights violation. It would also indicate that they didn't really have a choice in the matter because they were subjected to a limited population with whom to form relationships.\n\nThat's the argument I've been using for a long time.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; marriage is not about reproduction. \n\nThis is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. \n\nI imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include the following:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains a more respectful and reasoned tone, grounding its arguments in established points of law and ethics, which may resonate better with the original poster.

{"index": 97, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:I think the argument against Zoophillia based on lack of consent is only an effective argument for a tiny portion of the population.\n\nOriginal Post: \nSo the most popular non-religious argument against beastiality is that such actions are wrong because it is impossible to get any kind of consent. I think it is possible to argue otherwise (for some animals it is very easy to read their emotional state), but I won't argue that because I think the whole idea that consent would be necessary in these situations is completely inconsistent with how animals are treated by the vast majority of our population, including vegetarians.\n\nExample 1(for the vegetarians, but applicable for everyone): Pet ownership. Do we get consent when we take a puppy from his parents? Do we get consent when we neuter them? If you assume that consent is essential in animal/human relationships, pet ownership itself becomes a kind of slavery or imprisonment. The owner provides food and housing, the pet is imprisoned and provides entertainment to the owner. Any argument you could run about this being justifiable without consent would frighteningly similar to arguments for why slavery in the U.S. was good for many of the slaves. Arguments that they \"seem happy,\" or \"they don't run away\" are meaningless when you have kidnapped an animal and brought it up to be dependent on you. I'm not saying pet ownership IS slavery; I'm saying that the only way it pet ownership can be justified is if you toss out the idea of needing consent for our interactions with animals.\n\nExample 2(for the carnivores): The vast majority of human beings eat animals. If you are one of this majority, the idea that you would ask an animals consent for anything is laughable. You could argue that unnecessary cruelty is still wrong, but much beastiality clearly involves the pleasuring of the animal, not the torturing of it. And regardless, arguments against cruelty have nothing to do with \"consent.\"\n\nSo that's my basic argument. Come on reddit, change my view!\n\nEdit: Changed zoophillia to beastility since zoophillia does not necessarily involve actual sex with animals. \n\nEdit 2: Just to clarify, I think bestiality is both disgusting and morally wrong. I think that cruelty to animals is wrong.

We do throw out the concept of consent for ownership, but not for *everything*.  In fact it's fairly common for one person to break into another person's car if a pet is locked in without ventilation.  People are willing to put their rights and safety at risk and to damage another person's property.  There are comparable with excessively disciplining animals.  Society at large doesn't just think that an owner can do as they please with their pets.\n\n&gt;  The vast majority of human beings eat animals.\n\nHere you are merging the concept of animals as pets and animals as food.  While in many cases the animal is the same, the relationship is starkly different.  It would be like saying that humans are ok with other humans being beaten nearly to death because we all know that it happens in torture scenarios.  There are corner case scenarios which allow for a set of behaviors but that does not mean that they can be extended to everything.  Humans make what we feel are necessary concessions in the treatment of animals because we ultimately need them to become our food.  This does not mean that we approve of everything that happens so much as we may not be able to stop it.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou are saying:\n\n1. We don't require an animal's consent for being kept as a pet, nor for eating it or consuming its milk, so consent is not relevant to human-animal interactions;\n2. Sex is just another human-animal interaction;\n3. Hence consent is also not relevant to humans having sex with animals, aka bestiality.\n\nClearly (1) is true, and (3) is a simple logical inference. But the weak point in your argument is (2), i.e., your assumption that there isn't anything special about sex.\n\nIn actuality, there are some things that are special about sex, in particular in regards to consent. We are ok with an adult playing basketball with a consenting minor, or forcing a minor to go to school even without consent, but we are not ok with an adult having sex with a minor in any situation. In other words, there are things adults can do with children that do not require their consent (forcing them to go to school) and there are things we do not consider children to be able to consent to in any situation (sex), even though the majority of adult-child interactions are guided by consent (playing basketball).\n\nThe argument could then be made, that animals are a parallel to children. Animals can be forced to do some things without their consent, like keeping them as pets or eating them for food, which would parallel adults forcing children to go to school. We don't require consent in those areas. And there are some things that we just do not consider animals to be able to consent to, and are therefore forbidden, namely sex, which would be a direct parallel to sex with children.\n\nNow, you make a fair point that there might be a form of inconsistency here - why is it ok to ignore consent in some areas, and not in sex? However, the same potential inconsistency exists in society's treatment of children, and not just in society's treatment of animals, so if there is an inconsistency (debatable) it is at least one which society applies in a consistent way between animals and children.\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that leads to this prediction is the structured, logical argumentation present in the second response, which effectively addresses the original poster's reasoning while subtly guiding them to reconsider their views on consent. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains a calm and analytical tone, aiming to engage the original poster in a rational discussion about the implications of their assertions.

Hitler built a kickass highway system, and was mostly motivated by a love for Germany, but was also personally responsible for genocide. Gandhi was a bad father and a pedophile, but also freed India from colonialism, and inspired millions. Hitler has a mostly bad reputation, whereas Gandhi has a thoroughly positive reputation.

Or, are they both complicated individuals responsible for complicated actions, all with good and bad elements to varying degrees?\n\nSecond Response: \nAre you limiting this to only legal sanctions, or to ethical considerations in general?  Because legally of course you're either found guilty or not guilty, but even there, there's gray in the sense that things like motivation is taken into account.

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That's why \"it showed up on my news feed\" is the classic defence to that.\n\nIt's like the difference between reading a magazine that has pictures of someone and specifically seeking out all the magazines you can find with pictures of that person, cutting them all out, and putting them in a scrapbook. (I'll concede that one is much more effort than the other, but I think the analogy holds)\n\nIt shows that you have a level of interest in that person that is disconcerting \u2013\u00a0you want to find out lots of information about that person and follow their life without their involvement, consent or knowledge.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou can't use the the fact that something is allowable online as justification for expecting people not to act negatively toward a behavior.  Especially when said behavior makes them feel uncomfortable.  If a person or persons views being researched online as a violation of boundaries, you either need to respect it or establish that you do not respect their boundaries.  While they might not be able to stop you, they certainly don't need to like or accept the behavior in a social context.  One way displaying displeasure with such behavior is to refer to it as \"creeping\" and those doing it as being a \"creeper\".\n\nSo another way to word your question is:  \"Do people have a right to be upset that I learned things about them I found they posted online?\"  I say yes, why?  Because people have a right to their feelings, people establish social norms and boundaries and may be upset when someone violates it. \n\nFirst I much address:\n\n \"presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.\"\n\nYou presume to much, something posted on social media does not imply that the poster means for it be information observed, retained, and reported by every single person who could find access to it.  It might not be secret, but it is not meant to be a conversation piece either.\n\nIf I go to a coffee shop and have a personal conversation with a friend about my Mother dying of cancer, it's not a secret conversation and people may over hear.  However if someone, even an acquaintance, comes up to me a month later and starts a conversation with \"I heard you talking about your dying Mom at Starbucks last April.\"  I'm going to find it off putting, and likely consider that person a creep.  \n\nThe online world seems to become a place where people tell themselves that if a door is unlocked they are allowed inside.  If someone leaves a photo album open, they are allowed to open the book make copies of all the pictures and maybe using them in Photoshop later.  While legally, they are right with the second example, social norms in groups may have different rules.  These rules can change from group to group and you don't have to agree to them to be held to them in the eyes of the group.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that people not only take issue with the action of being researched, they also take issue with and are made uncomfortable with  idea of someone taking the time and effort to research them and see what is available about them online.  They may not be able to stop said activity, but they certaintly don't need to treat it as an acceptable for of social interaction.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post, we can compare their stylistic elements:\n\n### First Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is somewhat clinical and rational, focusing on logical distinctions without appealing heavily to emotions.

{"index": 101, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Common Core (esp. Mathematics) is a system that is fundamentally flawed and does not prepare students for the real world.\n\nOriginal Post: \nTo my understanding, Common Core is a set of standards of skills that a student should learn before graduating high school. Though I am still quite some years before getting there, what I have observed in my school's mathematics system shows that these skills rely heavily on memorization and calculation, much less on reasoning, and virtually none on application. I've looked at the Common Core website and seen that these accurately reflect the standards put out.\n\nLet's take the [Common Core Algebra standards](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSA/introduction/) as an example. If you scroll down to the Overview, you see that almost all of the skills listed are to solve equations or something of that sort. This is calculation. Common Core currently spends too much time on this, something relatively easy such that computers can do it. Some of this time needs to shift to the other branches of mathematics.\n\nI believe that algebra, as well as much of the rest of mathematics, should be used as a medium through which logic and reasoning are taught. Though computers can use logic to some extent, the human brain is much more capable and should be used for what it is needed for. [Here is a purely algebraic problem.](http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1981_AHSME_Problems#Problem_30) Despite the concepts being purely algebraic, it requires high levels of critical thinking and reasoning in order to solve. This is the type of multi-step problem that should be taught in high schools, but is almost always not. Common Core does not require students to display this level of critical thinking.\n\nLet's take [Geometry for another example.](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/HSG/introduction/) If you scroll down to the Overview, these standards are somewhat better, since they introduce the notion of proof. However, on close inspection of the Congruence section, only a few basic proofs spanning a few basic proof types are necessary. These do not cover the important proof by contradiction and proof by induction, two kinds of reasoning that can be much better applied to the real world. It is also never required that the student prove any algebraic concepts, such as the quadratic formula. Most theorems in Geometry and all in Algebra are not proven, and the student is forced to memorize them. We have computers for that. We need people to prove and reason.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for concepts like Geometry to be taught in conjunction with other areas of mathematics, such as Calculus. I took Geometry in 8th grade, and though that is a bit early for Calculus, the idea of limits and things like that should have at least been touched upon. Why is it that the volume of a pyramid is Bh/3? The idea of taking some function to the limit makes it easy to prove this. Common Core does not cover this.\n\nSo far, I\u2019ve touched very little upon the idea of application, and mostly because that\u2019s the most difficult one. We know that mathematics is applied in all sorts of STEM subjects, but what if the student is already set on taking a liberal arts major? They shouldn\u2019t be forced to study engineering with math. So, I think that the application of mathematics needs to brought back to its roots, being the application of logic. Programming is great way to apply this, and though maybe math class isn\u2019t the right place for this, every student already has a programmable graphing calculator anyway. Instead of forcing students to not use programs on tests like they do at my school, I think that the use of programs should be encouraged, since they demonstrate understanding of the basis behind all mathematics, which is logic. Maybe this is straying a bit far from the purpose of Common Core, and it shouldn\u2019t be implemented as a guideline, but perhaps as a suggestion it would be great.\n\nI\u2019ll be going through Common Core for a few more years, and I want to know if it\u2019s effective. Please CMV.\n\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I think reasoning is much more important than having formulas memorized for the real world.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Like a lot of sporting events it is a prestige thing (which is part of why those corrupt regimes want it), and there isn't a good reason to pay for someone else's prestige. While you would certainly save money with reusing the infrastructure it will still be expensive, as you will need to be maintaining stuff far beyond was is necessary locally between each games.

They were successful and the infrastructure benefits have paid for their costs long term, even if they all had a couple unnecessary temporary facilities.  \n\nBeijing *did* do a lot to clean up the city, even if you don't trust their numbers.  The Atlanta &amp; Sydney games are probably a wash in terms of cost/benefit, depending on whom you ask.\n\n&gt;  blatantly wasteful \n\nThat's not to say all have been successful.  Sochi was a mess of epic proportions.  Montreal, Nagano, and Lake Placid were bad too... all of them badly overestimated future tourism and growth of their host cities.\n\nI'm not sure how far back in time you want to go.\n\nThe games can be beneficial, and they can be money pits.  It really comes down to management. \n\n&gt; I think the Olympic Games should be held in Greece every four years\n\nYou are aware that the Athens games were among the most mismanaged and over budget ever, right?\n\n&gt;  this would allow Greece to reap the benefits of the economic surplus generated by the Games\n\nI'm not sure we need to further enable Greece to be financially irresponsible and devoid of a real economy.

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nYou can't use the the fact that something is allowable online as justification for expecting people not to act negatively toward a behavior.  Especially when said behavior makes them feel uncomfortable.  If a person or persons views being researched online as a violation of boundaries, you either need to respect it or establish that you do not respect their boundaries.  While they might not be able to stop you, they certainly don't need to like or accept the behavior in a social context.  One way displaying displeasure with such behavior is to refer to it as \"creeping\" and those doing it as being a \"creeper\".\n\nSo another way to word your question is:  \"Do people have a right to be upset that I learned things about them I found they posted online?\"  I say yes, why?  Because people have a right to their feelings, people establish social norms and boundaries and may be upset when someone violates it. \n\nFirst I much address:\n\n \"presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.\"\n\nYou presume to much, something posted on social media does not imply that the poster means for it be information observed, retained, and reported by every single person who could find access to it.  It might not be secret, but it is not meant to be a conversation piece either.\n\nIf I go to a coffee shop and have a personal conversation with a friend about my Mother dying of cancer, it's not a secret conversation and people may over hear.  However if someone, even an acquaintance, comes up to me a month later and starts a conversation with \"I heard you talking about your dying Mom at Starbucks last April.\"  I'm going to find it off putting, and likely consider that person a creep.  \n\nThe online world seems to become a place where people tell themselves that if a door is unlocked they are allowed inside.  If someone leaves a photo album open, they are allowed to open the book make copies of all the pictures and maybe using them in Photoshop later.  While legally, they are right with the second example, social norms in groups may have different rules.  These rules can change from group to group and you don't have to agree to them to be held to them in the eyes of the group.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that people not only take issue with the action of being researched, they also take issue with and are made uncomfortable with  idea of someone taking the time and effort to research them and see what is available about them online.  They may not be able to stop said activity, but they certaintly don't need to treat it as an acceptable for of social interaction.\n\nSecond Response: \nInstead of assuming that these people don't understand how the internet works, you might try considering the possibility that you haven't given enough thought to the way *privacy* works.\n\nWhat does it mean to have privacy? The definition I like best (credit to [Helen Nissenbaum](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=_xJfVdDBLcb_ywPdgYLoAg&amp;url=http://crypto.stanford.edu/portia/papers/RevnissenbaumDTP31.pdf&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGBN-P8lmftoRARQIaFC7puTCFEQA&amp;sig2=Gt2vJs2OOigOi9cgEkJ1dA)) holds that it means having a certain degree of control over information about oneself. \n\nThat control can be achieved in a number of different ways. Your home is generally a private place by default, because access is physically restricted to those who are invited inside. But the privacy of your home isn't contingent on the fact that people aren't able to get through your door without a key. The fact that it's understood as a private space leads to a generally acknowledged *expectation* of privacy that demands the respect of others by way of an unspoken social contract, so that you feel your right to privacy has been violated when someone on the roof of the neighboring building peers into your bedroom window through binoculars.\n\nAnother form of privacy is that which we expect to have in otherwise public spaces, even when we're completely surrounded by strangers. Think about what it's like to have a conversation in a crowded restaurant. Although it's true that everyone around you can easily eavesdrop, you aren't speaking to them, and the social norms governing that situation dictate that they should ignore you. If someone were to sit nearby and actively listen to you and your friends without having been invited, you'd probably feel that your privacy wasn't being properly respected.\n\nOnline social media spaces are a lot like that. Everybody has access, but having access isn't the same thing as having an invitation. Do you remember how upset people were when Facebook first rolled out the news feed? None of the things being displayed there were shown to people who didn't already have access to them, but the architecture of the virtual space had been radically altered. Exchanging wall posts used to be like having a private conversation in a restaurant. Suddenly, it was more like *performing* a conversation on a stage, in full view of a room full of people who were actively paying attention. Check out [danah boyd's article](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;ei=JxdfVa2wIpDJogTet4OoDw&amp;url=http://www.danah.org/papers/FacebookPrivacyTrainwreck.pdf&amp;ved=0CCIQFjAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF8fUtm1RijtNSQnmv9HjXtSoUI-g&amp;sig2=u9tqPkv_lOBeSGrI3-Wxbg) on the Facebook community's reaction to that event.\n\nWhen people call you a creep for knowing about something they've shared on Facebook, what they're really upset about is the fact that you've misunderstood your relationship with them and that information. You may have had access to it, but it wasn't meant for you. You've joined a conversation to which you weren't invited. Being able to recognize the difference between a conversation that you're allowed to join and one you're supposed to ignore even when it's happening right in front of you is a social skill that is just as important online as it is in real life.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "The two responses vary significantly in their engagement style and emotional resonance with the original post.\n\n**First Response:**\n\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response adopts a somewhat confrontational and disapproving tone. It emphasizes the feelings of discomfort that might arise from others \"creeping,\" subtly shaming the original poster\u2019s perspective.

{"index": 104, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Marriage is an unreasonable expectation of relationships.\n\nOriginal Post: \nNew here, so please correct me if I am doing anything wrong.\n\nBefore I begin I want to point out that this is strictly opinionated and based off of personal observations. Also my grammar isn't the best so please forgive any errors.\n \nThe main issue I have with marriage is the consequences of ending it. I do understand that this can be avoided to a degree with prenuptial agreements however, they are generally frowned upon. The idea of penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship seems counterproductive to me. This creates a sense of security to those who have refrained from showing or disclosing certain habits or personality traits to their spouse. It also encourages many to \"let themselves go.\" By that I mean things such as weight gain, poor hygiene, addictions, etc. \n\nSecondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.\n\nAll of that said, my opinion is probably a bit biased due to my now divorced parents' marriage, but I am open to hear other arguments on the issue.\n\nEdit: First off, I'd like to thank everyone for their responses. I'd just like to clear up some things I didn't communicate well in my post.\n\n1. By penalizing I wasn't just referring to spousal support and alimony but the legal fees as well.\n\n2. The argument I made was not meant to necessarily knock the institution of marriage because I do think it can work but there does exist many problems with how a failed marriage is dealt with...at least here in the US. My issue is mainly with society's expectation that long term relationships must eventually lead to marriage when it is not for everyone.\n\nLastly, a few of you pointed out the issues that arise when one spouse stays at home with the children and the other wants out of the marriage down the line. I do now see more of a purpose for it when the intention is to start a family. \n\n\nFirst Response: \nSorry about your parents. That really sucks, and I hope you're able to maintain a healthy relationship with them both. \n\nAbout your CMV, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by \"penalizing someone for ending a failing relationship.\" When two people divorce, generally the state divides their income &amp; assets in half, and every effort is made to ensure that neither party gets to walk away with everything and leave their spouse with bupkis. Basically the whole point of divorce law is to ensure a fair division of property. This includes alimony &amp; child support if one of the spouses has no ready way to make their own income.\n\nThe problem is that it's cheaper for two working adults to share a household, so when they have to go back to living in a single-income household, finances can get tight. There's nothing courts can do about this: it simply flat out costs more to maintain two houses than to maintain just one. I don't think this is a \"penalty\" for divorce so much as it means simply losing the financial benefit of being married (or civil union'd or what have you).\n\nSecond Response: \nMarriages ending aren't attempting to penalize people, most of the typical \"downsides\" are actually benefits if you look at them in context. Yes, it sucks that you sometimes need to use the legal system to split your properties in half, but on the plus side, you have a system to ensure you can at least get half of the things the two of you owned as a couple. There are way's that this can be done without marriage at this point of course, but they still hold the same \"drawbacks\". another huge benefit is custody rights.\n\nThe argument of \"letting yourself go\" has nothing to do with actually getting married. it has to do with being around someone and not having feeling a strong pressure to find someone to be with. This happens with or without marriage, and its really down to the couple to handle that.\n\n&gt; Secondly, I have seen in many cases where there is just no repairing the relationship, yet the couple remains together due to the financial repercussions of ending their failed marriage. This ultimately leads to a very uncomfortable situation at home, especially for children. It also in many cases leads to infidelity which brings a plethora of problems itself.\n\nThe big issue here is that the alternative is much worse. This is usually about the person who has a larger income feeling they deserve more of the assets after the divorce, and not wanting to give that up. Yes, it can really suck, but imagine if assets were not split? Especially if there are children involved, things can get very complicated. Imagine a situation with one stay at home parent, and one employed parent. The couple made this decision because it made sense at the time, but now they are unhappy and wish to divorce. The stay at home parent has very few technical skills from not being a part of the work force, is the primary caretaker of the child and would likely have custody, and if they were not entitled to any of the assets that the employed parent had, they would really have nothing, despite that they were operating and working as a team.\n\nAnd yes, I am aware that legal fee's are quite high, and that's really the biggest issue. That being said, the legal protection is what makes a marriage a risk more safe. I would be less willing to share a bank account, and all of my possessions with another person if there was not any form of legal protection in place to help deal with that.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The second response maintains a more constructive and positive tone, framing the \u201cdownsides\u201d of marriage not as penalties but as safeguards. The responder tries to reframe the original poster's perception, suggesting that the legal system provides beneficial protections that ultimately support both parties, especially when children are involved. In contrast, the first response seems somewhat dismissive when stating that the speaker does not understand the original poster's perspective, which could alienate them.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:** The second response uses comparison and hypothetical scenarios to illustrate the potential consequences of not having legal protections in place during a divorce. This engages the original poster's concerns about the negative aspects of marriage by presenting a counter-argument that acknowledges those concerns but argues that the alternatives could lead to worse outcomes. This rhetorical strategy actively encourages the original poster to reconsider their stance. The first response, while informative, primarily refutes key points without offering alternative viewpoints or reassurances.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster:** The second response actively engages with specific points raised by the original poster, offering clarifications and examples that demonstrate an understanding of the complexities involved in marriage and divorce. The use of direct quotations from the original post helps to connect the responder's points back to the original poster\u2019s arguments, which may resonate more with them. On the other hand, while the first response acknowledges the original poster's situation, it mainly focuses on legal definitions rather than emotional dynamics, which may fail to persuade the original poster to change their view.\n\nOverall, the second response's ability to empathize, recontextualize the issues, and directly address the original poster's specific arguments likely made a stronger impact on the original poster\u2019s beliefs.", "is_correct": true}

{"index": 107, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Mainstream acceptance of the Book of Mormon Musical shows that joking about a religion (of any kind) should be allowed in the USA\n\nOriginal Post: \nTo start off yes I am Mormon and no I am not offended by The Book of Mormon Musical. In fact I know a ton of very devout Mormons who have seen the play and they all said that they thought it was very funny. In fact the LDS (Mormon) church even bought ads in the Playbills of the musical to direct the audience to the official LDS website. Prominent political figures such as Hilary Clinton have also seen the play and didn't have any issues about it.\n\nYet at the same time there are certain religions in the United States that are big no-no's to make fun of.  This seems slightly counter intuitive. \n\nI only have the view from a Mormon perspective but there have been other pieces of media that openly mock and slap at Mormons including [this](http://images.politico.com/global/2012/07/bbw_mormonempire_cover29.jpg) from the cover of Bloomberg Businessweek. For a little bit of background on this cover and what it is depicting. That is Joseph Smith who is the founder of the Mormon church along with another member of the church receiving a blessing from an angel.  Obviously this angel did not say those things that are on the cover and disputing what the cover brings up is a topic for a different subreddit, so please don't address those things, but know that this cover is offensive to most Mormons. This scene in Mormon theology is as sacred as Moses receiving the ten commandments or Buddha reaching Nirvana. \n\nSo I guess I'm just trying to understand why its acceptable to harshly mock some religions (not just Mormons) but not others.\n\nTL;DR Why is it politically correct to never criticize one religion but its okay to criticize another?\n\n\n\nEdit: /u/nosotros_road_sodium explained it the best with the [Punch UP vs Punch Down idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35md5x/cmv_mainstream_acceptance_of_the_book_of_mormon/cr5qlbl).

One can talk and discuss religion in general with them without the feeling they are talking to either a wall or a broken record.\n\nA lot of Christians I know are similar, you can mock their faith all you want, they understand that different people hold different views and not everybody believes as they do and it's fine. Joke about the religion and they laugh, say something dumb about it and they ignore you.\n\nYet other Christians I've met or heard about seem to want to grab arms as soon as a non-believer even mentions god. Or treat you as if you're denying the day and night cycle.\n\nMost people I know that follow the Islam are different than that, the \"mature\" people will simply not like it when you joke about the religion and give you very foul looks if you say something dumb about it. The not-so-mature folks will take greater offence.\n\nIn the end, the reason why I think it's okay to joke about some religions and not others is because some religions have a lot of supporters that get really pissed if you joke about their religion.\n\nAs for how it should be, or rather, how I think it should be, acceptance for people saying dumb shit should be lower. I'm all for freedom of speech, it's important and should be an universal basic right. It should NOT be about how dumb religious people are and it should not be about how all non-believers should go to hell. It's not helping anybody, doesn't change opinions and only stirs up trouble for no good reason. Somebody yelling something thats obviously wrong should be slapped (probably figuratively, *maybe* literally) and educated. You are free to believe what you want but your not free to sprout bullshit. There is plenty of room for discussing non-scientific things in a civilized manner. Usually this is philosophy, which is probably just as great as science is.\n\nSecond Response: \nAs to why it's OK to mock some religions but not others in American culture, look up the meaning of [punching up vs. punching down](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2014/07/21/never-punch-down/). \n\nMocking a majority religion like Christianity is degrees edgier than mocking a minority religion like Islam. Yes, I know a minority of Christians are LDS, but Mormons have become a cultural force in America whether: a major university with a powerhouse football program (BYU), the last Republican presidential candidate (Mitt Romney), and the numerous Mormons in business executive positions (Marriott for instance, from what I recall). \n\nMuslims, on the other hand, get lots of shit for choosing their faith, with the stereotype of being terrorists/terrorist apologists/anti-American rising post 9/11. look at how many \"Obama is a covert Muslim\" remarks have been spread around AM radio, blogs, Free Republic, etc. since Obama entered the national political scene. The \"All-American Muslim\" reality show, an attempt to show how Muslims are \"just as American\" as WASPs, backfired big time, while the same audiences offended by such a show embrace reality TV about fundamentalist Christianity like \"19 Kids and Counting\".\n\nTL;DR: Mocking a majority religion = standing up to a bully, mocking a minority religion = kicking a dead man.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading me to this prediction stem from the tone, rhetorical techniques, and overall engagement with the original poster. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more comprehensive and analytical tone, utilizing references to cultural dynamics and the historical context of religion in America. It conveys empathy towards minority religions, particularly Islam, while framing mockery of majority religions as a necessary pushback against prevailing societal norms. This persuasive tone can resonate more effectively with the original poster's curiosity and seek to challenge their view through logical reasoning. \n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs a stronger use of analogies (e.g., \"standing up to a bully\" vs. \"kicking a dead man\"), which serve to clarify and emphasize the differing social dynamics surrounding religion. By invoking examples and contemporary implications (e.g., referencing media portrayals), the response provides a richer context, making it easier for the original poster to reconsider their stance.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response is more structured, facilitating easier understanding of complex ideas. It's straightforward yet nuanced without being overly verbose, engaging the reader effectively.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: By directly addressing the question posed in the original post and relating concepts like \"punching up\" vs. \"punching down,\" the second response connects back to the original poster's inquiry thoughtfully, thus enhancing the likelihood of changing their perspective.\n\nIn comparison, while the first response discusses similar ideas, it does so in a less organized manner and lacks the depth found in the second response. It also does not pose a convincing moral framework for why certain religions can be mocked, which is central to the original post's query.

{"index": 108, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If straight and cis people attend a Pride parade, they should spend some of their time there volunteering.\n\nOriginal Post: \nContext: I'm a straight cis man with a lot of straight friends (as well as LGBTQA+ friends) who often go to Boston Pride Parade and NYC Pride Parade. I've never gone to one myself (always find out about it a few days after it happens), but I'm planning on going to volunteer at next year's Boston parade, assuming I'm home from school in time.\n\nI personally get a little uncomfortable when I see straight people partying hard at Pride parades. To me, the parades are supposed to celebrate marginalized social groups who are often shoved under wave after wave of oppression and hatred the other 364 days of the year and has this one day to fully let loose and celebrate in the face of a culture who still may not accept them in the way that they'd like. When straight people jump in, it almost feels like they're co-opting the one day in which non-straight people are finally in control. It seems to me to be similar to straight people putting a rainbow filter over their profile pictures - in theory, it might be OK, but in practice it shifts the attention from the LGBTQA+ people who deserve it onto the straight person who steps in. Almost like a \"Look at me, I'm celebrating pride! Look at how great I am!\"\n\nAnd, yeah, to a certain extent I think this display of solidarity is good. Gay/trans/queer rights won't move forward without the support of those already in power - straight people - and it's nice to see people united across gender and sexuality boundaries in order to celebrate how far we've come and prepare for how far we still have to go. That being said, though, I think there's a point at which a display of solidarity becomes less about the people for whom the solidarity is shown and more about the people who are \"showing\" the solidarity. I think that at a certain point, support for the LGBTQA+ community can transition into an exercise in self-promotion and narcissism, and I'm not super comfortable with that.\n\nThis is why I think that straight/cis people who participate in Pride parades should spend some of that participation on volunteering. The parades really run on volunteers, and if a straight/cis person spends time doing the thankless task of picking up trash, filling and lugging big containers of water everywhere, or making sure a first-aid tent is properly staffed, it helps show support for the LGBTQA+ community in a way that simply taking selfies with a shirtless parader will never be able to. I think it's a great way to be an ally to the community in a way that doesn't obnoxiously trumpet that allyship, and it might teach people more about what really makes the revelry run smoothly and give them a new appreciation for something many almost take for granted.\n\ntl;dr Volunteering is a helpful form of allyship for straight/cis people in a way that just going to the parade and celebrating is not.\n\n**EDIT:** Just a clarification - I believe that people shouldn't be *forced* to volunteer, and going to the parade at all is still preferable by far to not going. That said, I think that going and volunteering is far enough preferable to just going to participate that it should be pretty heavily suggested for people planning to go.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Now, before you rip me to pieces, hear me out.  It's a disability that a person does to themselves.  It's a disability that is completely avoidable, and I think for these reason people don't like to classify it as a disability.  However, I still think it's a disability because it makes it harder to perform every day tasks.\n\nHere's a comparison that I use.  Imagine you cut off your leg with a hacksaw, for no good reason.  You're now missing a leg, and I would consider you to be disabled.  You did it to yourself, and you could have made different life choices to avoid becoming disabled, but you are disabled all the same.  You might argue that someone who cuts off their own leg obviously has some mental issues, but that could be said for a person who allows themself to become severely obese.  For example, depression leads to overeating for many people.\n\nSo why should obese people be denied some of the \"benefits\" of being disabled, just because they did it to themselves?\n\nAnd I hate that I feel like I have to even say this, but no, I am not overweight, and I do not have any personal agenda.  I am honestly curious why people believe this, and I am willing to reconsider my views.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

But the context of when and how the discussion comes up matters.\n\n1: Imagine you have a dude who doesn't have a leg because he carelessly cut is off with a hacksaw. Then you have an obese person who is too big to walk. They both go to a grocery store and there is one scooter. Well the amputee can't walk because he has one leg. The obese person could just stop eating so much, and maybe wouldn't be so big if they'd just walk. In fact, they probably SHOULD be walking. When people say obesity isn't a disability, I think it usually comes up in a context like this, where people try to use obesity as a way of getting out of basic activities of daily living or to get special accomodations. People generally don't like the idea of someone getting special treatment because they are too lazy to walk, or don't have the self-control to maintain their health. It's kind of more like someone who complains about being thirsty, but won't drink water.\n\n2: Obesity can cause disabilities, but isn't a disability in and of itself. Again, people lose sympathy when it is something where people make a daily decision to stay that way. \n\n3: Sometimes people will blame their obesity on their health conditions, rather than their health conditions on their obesity. So when a person says they can't exercise because they have a bad back or bad knees or whatever else and that's why they're obese, the common sentiment is that \"no, you aren't disabled, you're just fat. Lose weight and you won't be 'disabled' anymore\".\n\nSecond Response: \nIn your analogy, the guy who hacks off his own leg is permanently crippled.  He may regret his decision but there's nothing he can do about it, his leg is still gone.  He can't get it back no matter how much he tries, it's just gone.\n\nBeing obese (in most cases) is not just a 'well they did it to themself' but rather the result of an ongoing series of self-destructive choices ('they are continuing to do it to themself').  The obese person (generally) only stays obese through a continued lifestyle of bad diet and low exercise.  This is a choice they make every time they pick up a McLardBurger.  If the obese person improved their diet and started exercising, their weight would improve and they would no longer be disabled.\n\nTherefore, we can say that an obese person is *continually choosing to be disabled* and thus shouldn't be afforded the same benefits as someone who does not have a choice.\n\nLet me make an analogy here- **let's say I tied a rope around my legs and handcuffed myself behind my back.  I then claim that I am disabled** and I need a wheelchair and someone to push me around and spoon feed me because I am unable to do these things.  **Would you support spending tens of thousands of dollars to pay for my wheelchair and an aide?**  \nNo of course not, because I am only 'disabled' by choice and I can choose to become un-disabled whenever I want.  Therefore while my present situation may require accommodations, *by choosing not to correct that situation I am also choosing to require those accommodations*.  This is little different than parking in a handicap spot because I'm too lazy to walk across the parking lot- handicap accommodations are for people who are handicapped by illness or injury, not people who choose to reduce their own capabilities.\n\nThe correct solution for someone like this not to spend $10k+ on wheelchairs and aides and whatnot, it's to give them the tools they need to improve their own situations-  a handcuff key and a pair of scissors will do nicely.  Or if you want to go REALLY hands on, un-handcuff them and then cut the rope for them.\n\n-----\n\n**Let's take a couple of similar analogies to illustrate.**\n\nMy job involves just talking on the phone, and I'm really really lazy.  I sit in bed all day talking on the phone, never moving an inch.  As a result my muscles atrophy and i'm now extremely weak.  Do I have the right to demand that self-closing doors have their tension reduced because I'm otherwise too weak to open them?  \n\nIt's the middle of summer, and I show up somewhere wearing a thick winter parka.  I complain that it's too hot and I demand the AC be turned up.  I refuse to take off my parka because it's my right to wear the parka, but my overheating will cause me medical problems therefore I need accommodation.  Is this reasonable?  No of course not because I'm creating a problem and demanding other people fix it (even when I can fix it for myself cheaper and faster).\n\nIf I drink too much at a party, and I'm still drunk or very hung over the next day and I can't do my job, should I be able to claim medical disability leave and get a paid day off?  No of course not, because the only reason I'm unable to work is because I made irresponsible bad choices the night before.\n\nIf I do a bunch of drugs and show up to work fucked up, and my manager fires me, should I be able to claim discrimination against a disabled person because my manager discriminated against my disability?  No of course not, because any 'disability' I have is the direct result of irresponsible bad choices.\n\nIf I get addicted and I have a continual habit of drug or alcohol abuse, should I demand special accommodation from my employer because of a disability?  No, because (while addiction is very real), it's still within my control.  My employer shouldn't be forced to pay for my bad life choices.\n\nAnd food/weight is the same thing.  If I eat two McLardBurgers and a 128oz soda for lunch and again for dinner every day, pretty soon I'll be morbidly obese.  Should I demand that doors be made wider for me to fit through?  Should I demand a free scooter from the government due to 'disability'?  Should I demand airlines give me two seats instead of one (but without charging me extra)?  Why should I get these accommodations if someone who's 'disabled' due to drinking or drugs (also choices, just like food) does not get those accommodations?  \n\n**Why should the drunk or the drug user be told to take responsibility, while the obese person gets a free pass?**\n\n-----\n\nNow this all said- there ARE legitimate medical conditions that directly cause obesity, and it's important to recognize their existence whenever on this subject.  Not everyone who's obese is just a fatass.  However it is the vast majority...\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Clarification of the Argument**: The second response provides clearer reasoning against the original post\u2019s view, presenting a structured argument that highlights the difference between permanent disabilities (like losing a leg) and obesity, which can be perceived as reversible through lifestyle choices.

{"index": 110, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: (NSFW) One needs proper consent to masturbate about someone.\n\nOriginal Post: \nConsent, I think we can agree, is a basic requirement for sex to be a positive act. Consent allows for there to be communication and reassurance between whoever is involved that what they're doing, and how they're doing it, is okay with their partner(s). Consent also allows for things that would otherwise be creepy or weird to come into a positive light and expressed in a healthy way. I would consider the act of objectifying to fall under this category. For example, a woman may be creeped out if a dude right in front of her at a party is just staring at her boobs without any concern for her at all. The same act of staring at the boobs is 100% fine if it's with her boyfriend while they're having consensual sexual relations.\n\nIf we take this same line of logic of consent that happens with sex and put it with masturbation, that's where I'm going with this. If you're thinking about another person in a sexual manner without them knowing about it, and then acting out that thought process by masturbating, it just seems a bit creepy to me. If I'm not allowed to objectify or do other sexual acts in person without having consent from the other person, I don't see how that wouldn't also translate over to masturbation. It's the same sexual thoughts, feelings, and intentions with the only difference being that the partner is not physically with you. Because they're not there with you, you can't ask for proper consent unless you physically ask them some other time if you can masturbate about them.\n\nThis line of thought has logic to it, but it's a conclusion that I don't like to face. This line of thought potentially makes masturbation an awful act if done without consent. It also makes it an act that wouldn't be allowed if no one gave any consent to you. You might be able to say that pornography that was paid for might be consensual masturbation because the model is being paid, and is therefore willing to consent to you masturbating. Even so, this doesn't allow you to explore your sexual desires outside of straight up porn unless someone says it's okay. If you asked me whether I'm for or against masturbation, I would say that I'm very pro-masturbation. The act has health benefits, relieves stress, is pleasurable, and all sorts of other fun goodies. It makes it so I don't want to come to the conclusion that I've come to that it needs strict consent about the person(s) that's involved in one's fantasies.\n\nSo please, CMV!\n\nEDIT: After reading over the many replies I've gotten (thank you all) I think my view has already sufficiently changed. Consent with masturbation has more of a tendency to be harmful than helpful and positive. There's a difference between one's thoughts and actions, and masturbation causes no harm if the one being fantasied about isn't informed. There was also the argument that ones thoughts and fantasies should be their own, and no one else's. Control of your own thoughts is a human necessity, and putting a limit on them could be hazardous. As long as I keep a mental image of someone in tact of who they are, and not just seeing them as a sex object, I think it's all fine and dandy.\n\nThanks guys. I felt like I must've been wrong with my logic somewhere, and you helped point to where. I needed that. :)\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You were talking to Sarah Marsh.\nDonald Kaufman: Oh, God. I was so in love with her.\nCharlie Kaufman: I know. And you were flirting with her. And she was being really sweet to you.\nDonald Kaufman: I remember that.\nCharlie Kaufman: Then, when you walked away, she started making fun of you with Kim Canetti. And it was like they were laughing at *me*. You didn't know at all. You seemed so happy.\nDonald Kaufman: I knew. I heard them.\nCharlie Kaufman: How come you looked so happy?\nDonald Kaufman: I loved Sarah, Charles. It was mine, that love. I owned it. Even Sarah didn't have the right to take it away. I can love whoever I want.\nCharlie Kaufman: But she thought you were pathetic.\nDonald Kaufman: That was her business, not mine. You are what you love, not what loves you. That's what I decided a long time ago.\n\nUltimately, I get to choose the object of my desire. Even if that person despises me, I can still choose to love them. Donald Kaufman was not in the wrong to think about, love, and masturbate to his fantasy girl. It does no harm to her, and it did a lot of good for him. \n\nSecond Response: \nIn this same regard though, wouldn't it be the same as someone thinking about punching someone in the face as assault? Or thinking about harming someone, or murdering them be considered attempted man slaughter? \n\nWhat about a sexual dream involving someone you know, that didn't consent to the dream your subconscious had about them? Would that be considered rape?\n\nAlso, how are you going to monitor what people think at any given time? It honestly sounds like a movie where people are so controlled that they can't even have a thought without being punished. \n\nYou are essentially asking people to get permission to think. Thousands of thoughts go through peoples heads unchecked every day and no one is the wiser. I glanced at a woman this morning and noticed her boobs, they looked very nice, I thought about them for a while. Should I have told her? No, because there isn't a point, it would have just made her uncomfortable and then it can be constituted as harassment.\n\nIf the person was being asked to participate, then yes, consent is needed, but I don't need permission to think about someone, for any reason. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Both responses to the original post present persuasive arguments designed to challenge the original poster's view on the need for consent when it comes to fantasizing about or masturbating to someone. However, they differ significantly in tone, rhetorical techniques, engagement, and overall readability.\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response employs a more analytical and introspective tone. By referencing a film and a relevant quote, it directs attention to the complexities of unrequited love and personal desire. This approach allows for a deeper emotional engagement since it provides a narrative that the original poster can reflect upon.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** It uses a story from \"Adaptation\" as a metaphor to illustrate the legitimacy of having a personal fantasy, even in the absence of consent from the subject of the fantasy. This indirect argument adds emotional weight and invites the original poster to reconsider their stance on objectification and personal ownership of thoughts.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The response features varied sentence lengths, maintaining a flowing narrative style that keeps the reader engaged. It reads smoothly and clearly conveys the author's points.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** It engages the original poster by directly addressing their shared human experience and encouraging them to reflect on the nature of ownership in relation to desire.\n\n**Second Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The second response has a confrontational tone that challenges the original poster more directly. It uses rhetorical questions aggressively to dismantle the premise of needing consent for thoughts or fantasies.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** This response employs analogies that might initially appear humorous or exaggerated (e.g., comparing thoughts about sexual activity to thoughts about violence) to provoke a reaction. However, this technique might come off as dismissive rather than constructive.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** While it raises valid points, the sentence structure is less varied, making it feel somewhat chaotic. The rapid-fire questions and ideas may confuse the reader and make them less likely to absorb the underlying message.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** The response engages the original poster primarily through rhetorical questioning rather than dialogue, which could be seen as less inviting or respectful than the first response.\n\n**Prediction:**\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n**Key Factors:**\nThe key factor that leads to this prediction is the first response's emotional resonance and thought-provoking approach through storytelling. It encourages introspection and connects with the original poster's experiences, making the argument more relatable and compelling. The second response, while logically challenging the original poster's view, lacks the same depth of emotional engagement and may come across as overly confrontational, likely hindering its effectiveness in changing the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": true}

In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*\n\nI believe that:\n\n1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.\n\n2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.\n\n\nI do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.\n\nBut we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.\n\nI further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.\n\nChange my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm almost never driving after 10pm, don't drive much on rural roads, and most of my driving is on low-speed surface streets.\n\nStatistics are great  for getting overall trends, but suck at predicting individual outcomes.\n\nIf I lived alone (i.e., no spouse or family), were well-trained in handling firearms safely, with no history of depression, the odds would be dramatically different than the ones you list.  \n\nIn that case, it would be perfectly rational for me to have a gun, since I'm not likely to use it to commit suicide, my non-existent kid isn't going to find it and accidentally kill his friend, and I'm not going to wake up without knowing my non-existent wife slipped out to satisfy a Ben and Jerry's craving and shoot her because I think she's a burglar.\n\nThere just aren't a whole lot of circumstances that make it likely that my gun would be used in error.\n\nYou point may hold that it's irrational *for the average person* to own a gun.  But for many real people it's completely rational.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think there are more exceptions to that rule than you care to admit.\n\nIf you've ever lived in the country, you know how valuable a gun can be.

But the best part is I've never had to shoot anyone. I've never even had to shoot *at* anyone. For most purposes, just the sight of a gun is enough.\n\nSo I'd argue that it is very rational to keep a gun in your house for self-defense purposes.

{"index": 112, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: There are times when smacking a complete stranger's misbehaving child is justified.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'll allow that, in most cases, the misbehaving kid is just throwing a temper tantrum, but what do you do in cases where the kid has thrown himself on the floor in the middle of a restaurant and the waiters are going to trip over him and the parents are refusing to do anything about it? The rest of us have just become too polite of a society and other people who are affected by the bad behavior or might be injured in cases where the kid is throwing things, biting and kicking other people should be justified in disciplining a misbehaving child in a way that doesn't cause welts. Just a few instances of getting knocked on his butt by a complete stranger should be enough to get it through the kid's head that this is not something you do in public.\n\nFirst Response: \nHitting someone else is never \"justified\".  Even if it causes their life to improve 500 times over you can't just hit people because you don't like what they are doing. Especially a child could be horrified of going outside in future thinking someone 10 times their size might just hit them to the ground when they're doing something. \n\nBut verbally scolding them or telling them what they are doing is bad is fine in my eyes, but of course the mother/father will rightly so be angry you're going to upset their child. I highly doubt there would be many situations when the parent would feel happy you're treating their child bad. But you can let them be mad, you're..In theory..Doing the right thing, if you can take a bit of verbal abuse back at yourself and brush it off then go for it. Tell them to stop doing what they are doing and act properly. \n\n\nIf there's a kid on the floor a waiter should speak up and ask \"who's child is this?\" and if they refuse to make him behave they should be removed from the restaurant. \n\n\n\n\nBasically I think your idea is fine but you'd be going about it wrong.  You should watch the movie whiplash, it has that kind of abusive relationship to force someone to do what they should be doing. I think you might like that, plus it's a good movie.\n\n If you watch that movie you might be able to see how the child would be feeling in that situation, doing something wrong and being scolded over and over until you finally get it right is a very hard process and most likely won't work unless the person wants to change or is forced to.  Most children will grow out of it and understand what they are doing is wrong once they're forced into a school where behaving normal would be enforced properly, until then it'll mostly be up to the parents.  Your efforts at trying to change them could work amazingly, but most probably be a waste of time. The best you can do is get them to be removed and explain politely to the parents they need to control their child. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nAs a parent of two young children (2 1/2 and 4), I know that children can be highly unpredictable if their routine is broken. In a perfect world, I'd have my youngest in bed by 7:15 and oldest in bed by 9. That isn't always possible with life events (car is breaks down, need to wait by the repair shop, only place within walking distance for children is a family restaurant because they need to be fed. Or you're out for an extended family dinner, or whatever). \n\nI personally remove my children from the situation/area on the rare occurrences they pitch a major fit in public. I also get very annoyed with parents who ignore their kids in public places when they pull that shit. \n\nA customer, however, do not know the entire circumstances or get to dictate to me how I deal with my children. If I'm alone with my two children and one is having a meltdown in a restaurant, I need to get the second child at the table packed up to leave as well. If he's covered in food, that means a quick cleanup. He's likely to get pissed I'm taking him away from his food unexpectedly, and won't understand as he's 2. So now I might have two kids melting down. I might need to locate a staff member to tell them I'm not bailing on the bill or food, just stepping out to calm one of the kids down. This can take a couple minutes while I'm trying to keep the one having a meltdown calm. If you as a customer get antsy while this is happening and hit my kid, I'll punch your teeth out.\n\nNot to mention there can be extenuating circumstances. I have friends with young children that have mild developmental and mental disorders that can make their behavior unpredictable. They're capable of leading semi-independent lives and their doctor/child therapist recommendations are to get the kids out and with others to start adjusting them to different situations. You have no idea if the kid is on the autism spectrum, and hitting them is the worst thing you can do.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are the tone and emotional approach of each response, as well as engagement with the original poster's point. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response adopts a somewhat condescending tone, aiming to correct the original poster's stance but lacking personal connection or empathy.

If you are a vegetarian for any other reason, this does not apply\n\nBeing a vegetarian is more expensive than eating meat. Therefore, you need to get this money from elsewhere. This ultimately ends in a society having less money/resources, which they can give to the poor. Thus, you are kind of killing humans in trying to save animals. So vegetarians are basically putting other species of animals above their own, which I would say is objectively bad. \n\nOf course, this is not how society works, you are not directly killing people by being a vegetarian, but you are not directly helping animals either, so that is not an argument.\n\nI fail to see any argument against this. What about you?\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;Being a vegetarian is more expensive than eating meat.\n\nThis is an unsupported (and as far as I can tell, incorrect) assumption, and without it the rest of your **economic** argument falls apart.\n\nAnd I say economic because you are focused on the potential utility costs of the diet, but that's not what wholly goes into an **ethical** position, which your argument is supposed to be about (\"only talking about people who are vegetarians/vegans for ethical reasons\").\n\nAn ethical argument can be much more nuanced than straight up monetary utility.  As an easy example, many mentally and/or physically impaired people are overall drains on the economy -- is it ethical to kill them off to reallocate resources elsewhere?  What of the elderly or chronically ill?  If a vegetarian believes that right-to-life is a cornerstone of their ethical framework, and that animals should be afforded this right similar to humans, then they can ethically believe that animals should not be terminated even if society must bare some cost by changing diet.\n\nOf course, I think one would be hard pressed to support an argument that eating meat is cheaper than eating vegetarian.  There are plenty of dirt cheap vegetarian sources of cheap protein (such as rice&amp; beans, buckwheat, soy products, etc.), and a large segment of the impoverished world makes due with these staples and very little meat.\n\nSecond Response: \nNot a vegetarian myself but by the same reasoning:\n\nPlants are lower on the food chain than animals. Meat production costs more energy/resources due to the animals' metabolism, incomplete digestion, etc. This ultimately ends in our planet having less energy/resources that can be utilized, which can be used to help the poor. Thus, you are kind of killing humans in trying to produce meat.

I would offer, however, that at one point in time they were a minority, and with the advent of freedom of speech, their voices were allowed to shine in free, open, democratic discourse.

People are not really mad that we're talking about Cecil's killing in the wake of the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose. People are made that we're talking about Cecil's killing **at the expense of** talking about the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose.\n\nNobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic. People are arguing that the lion's death is not so tragic that it's worth completely ignoring yet more examples of not only police brutality but straight-up lies told by the police to cover that brutality up. We want positive change, sure, but it's good to prioritize.\n\nYou say that \"people have the capacity to care about more than one issue.\" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.\n\nTl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about \"less important\" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general. Therefore, we should apportion appropriately and not give undue attention to an issue which is not as important.\n\nSecond Response: \nIt doesn't take an expert to spot the flaw in that sort of argument. It is an informal fallacy, called \"appeal to worse problems\". There are many reasons why it does not work, you have named several.\n\nHowever, as with many fallacies, the idea behind it has merit. All problems are not equal. Devoting time, effort, money, etc. to lesser problems at the expense of larger ones is undesirable, all else being equal.

I've done several CMV's where I was the clear minority in terms of viewpoint, and got downvoted on nearly every post. Due to Reddit's karma system, this makes me wait a period of 7 minutes in between replies if my karma is low, and makes it more difficult for me to respond to everyone (the more karma you have, the less time you need to wait to post). If I act like a dick to you, act irrational, or say something logically fallacious, I implore you to downvote me, but I'd really like to be able to discuss with everybody and not be held back by my inability to reply (and consequently hear replies).\n\nOkay, onto my view. I'm not worried about the US government spying on citizens, for the following reasons.\n\n1. I don't necessarily \"have nothing to hide\", but I don't expect that there is literally a person on a computer looking through what I post to Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook (or what porn I look at). I have some personal things I wouldn't want an actual person to know or look through, but I feel entirely comfortable with a machine using a CTRL-F function to search for terrorist activity, or other organized illegal activities since I don't commit any major crime. I know a lot of people are worried about the government seeing people torrenting things illegally or watching movies/shows illegally on the internet, but considering how widely this is done and how nonexistent people are prosecuted for it based on the governments ability to view all this, I'm not worried about it. I don't do drugs, but if I did and tried to buy drugs over FB or text, I doubt the government would even care. We have /r/trees for instance, thousands of people openly doing minor illegal things and the government doesn't care enough to try and arrest them.\n\n2. I remember hearing during Rand Paul's filibuster that there has been terrorist activity stopped by government spying on people. I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. I also heard during the filibuster that the government was using spying to take down organized crime. I'm not worried about that, considering I'm not involved in organized crime and therefore am not worried about it. (I'd like to point out here, that it's not really a view regarding sympathy or empathy towards criminals and what rights they should have to privacy, but simply my *feeling of worry* about being spied on). I don't view the NSA spying on druglords to be much different than wire taps or undercover officers.\n\n3. In addition to the above, I have the view that Islamic extremism is, as of ISIS' international attacks (or extremist Muslims inspired by ISIS at least), a legitimate threat to the United States. There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications. They have claimed to have thousands of people in the US, and while that may be an exaggeration, I don't believe it to be unbelievable considering they have had 150 individuals that have travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS (Source: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/25/american-foreign-fighters-isis_n_6753854.html). I would expect if many people are willing to take the trouble to travel to another country to fight others, it's not unexpected that they more would stay in the US to try and perform terrorist activity here considering it would be easier.\n\n4. I'm not worried about the government knowing my political views. I broadcast them publicly on Facebook, and considering our country's devotion to free speech as well as multiple political parties, I don't view any dissent to be any threat to my well-being.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is a culture of finding and trading nude pictures at the NSA. It has been suspected that the NSA has shared data with other agencies (like police forces and the DEA). We are just one law away from allowing this data to officially be used by other agencies for even minor crimes. First it will start with something like child pornography, then they can target you for pirating content.\n\n&gt; I think government spying still has an effect as a deterrent (terrorists can't use media to communicate, and therefore it makes terrorist activity harder to commit. \n\nIt doesn't. Any sufficiently advanced terrorist is able to encrypt their communications, and the NSA can't yet break well-implemented encryption. This just makes the groups take more precautions. Osama Bin Ladin wasn't found by NSA programs, he was found by human intelligence.\n\n&gt; There have been US citizens that have gone to fight for ISIS and local Islamic extremist attacks, and believe the US should be able to spy on their communications.\n\nNobody is really against spying on foreign powers. If, in the course of spying on foreign powers, they find someone of interest in the US; they should get a warrant. The problem is that *everybody* is watched, and not just people of interest.\n\n&gt; I'm not worried about the government knowing my political views.\n\nThat's not really the concern. Say that someone with controversial views is running for office. A person with sufficient power has access to extremely private information that can be used to smear and/or blackmail anybody they want to keep from office. Whether or not they do it now is not the problem; all it takes is for one corrupt individual in the future to abuse it. Look at what Snowden got away with; it seems like you just need to bribe the right person at the NSA.\n\nSecond Response: \nConsider this situation:\n\nIn 10 years a candidate runs for high office, say a senate seat. He runs on a platform of curtailing the police state, ending the war on drugs and reducing domestic spying.\n\nThe NSA will have a database of the nude pictures he sent his girlfriend when he was 17. They will know about the fact he messed around with a guy when he was 19 and the fact that he had a crisis of faith in which he \"cursed god\" in a private email that he deleted before sending at 22.\n\nAllowing spying on this scale with little to no filter means granting domestic spy agencies even more severe power to tip the balance of political power in their favor, entrenching them even deeper.\n\nCase and point: The FBI revealed Martin Luther King's infidelity to his wife. In the threat to reveal the information they tried to convince MLK to kill himself.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/magazine/what-an-uncensored-letter-to-mlk-reveals.html?_r=0\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the emotional weight and impactful storytelling present in the second response. While both responses have an analytical tone, the second response provides a vivid hypothetical scenario that directly illustrates how government surveillance can be exploited for political manipulation.

{"index": 117, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Goldeneye 007 is useful only as a historical artifact and is, functionally, vastly inferior to today's FPS games.\n\nOriginal Post: \nLet me preface this by saying I own Goldeneye 007 and have played it in both single and multiplayer. Neither particularly impressed me. Note that I don't blame Goldeneye's developers for this; they did the best they could with what they had at the time, and if you compare it to Duke Nukem 64 or SNES Doom it beats them by a landslide. \n\nGoldeneye was absolutely revolutionary for its time, and shaped the path of future FPS games. However, by today's standards, it is absolutely awful and is outclassed in literally every way by today's games.  This is for a number of reasons, including mechanics, controls, and map variety. Despite this, many people choose to play Goldeneye, even though it is crap. \n\nIt's not even moderately close-ish who wins between, say, Battlefield 4 or Goldeneye. However, since I know you guys are going to point out the massive price disparity between buying a PS3/X360 with 4 controllers and an N64 with 4 controllers, I'm going to instead compare it with Timesplitters 2 on the PS2, which I believe to hold up far better today. A PS2 with 4 controllers and TS2 costs you $50 + $10x4 + $10 = $100. (Amazon prices) An N64 with 4 controllers and Goldeneye costs you $50 + $20x4 + $15 = $145. (Amazon prices) All of this is used.\n\nLet's first compare game mechanics. It makes sense that Goldeneye's game mechanics are less complex than Timesplitters 2's because the controller has fewer buttons. In Goldeneye you have the ability to do the following: aim, move, zoom in, fire, perform contextual actions, and switch weapons in one direction. Timesplitters 2 offers all of that as well as the ability to crouch and reload, as well as cycle backward and forward through your weapons. Of course, both of these games' mechanical complexities pale in comparison to today's FPS games, which add sprinting, jumping, and more.\n\nNext, controls. The N64's lack of dual analog makes the clear winner TS2. Other than that, they pretty much have the same control scheme. Props to Goldeneye for having more variety, but most of the variety is exceptionally poorly thought out schemes where moving and aiming are mixed between the C buttons and the analog stick.\n\nFinally, there is map variety. Due to the limitations of the N64, all of Goldeneye's maps are basically the same: completely indoor mazes of hallways and doors. Granted, there is much more variety than on most games of this type in that era, but compare this to TS2. You can CREATE YOUR OWN MAPS and many of the pre-created maps are outdoors. The maps also feel very different: the difference between Caves and Library is nothing compared to between Circus and Hangar, for instance.\n\nAll these points are why I feel that Goldeneye 007 is a relic of the past and if you're looking for a multiplayer FPS experience you are better off looking elsewhere. In fact, other than \"because I played it as a kid,\" or \"because I own no consoles newer than the N64,\" I don't think there is any reason at all to play Goldeneye.

It was developed by the same people who made Goldeneye. (The people at Rare left to form Free Radical, which is now called Crytek UK.)\n\nAnyways, the big advantage of Goldeneye is that it is perfectly balanced. All the features blend together to create a whole that is greater than the sum of it's parts. It's why people still listen to Mozart when they could be listening to Drake or Skrillex.\n\nI liked Timesplitters 2 plenty, but it was a vastly inferior game. All the guns were basically the same. The create a map feature was time consuming and clunky. The plot was awful, the characters were cheesy, and overall balance of the multiplayer experience was just off. It doesn't matter if one map is Western themed while another is Al Capone Chicago if the maps are basically the same with different window dressing.\n\nCompare Mario 64 to Mario Bros 3. Though they are both platformers, they are totally different types of games. In the same way, 3D RPG's like Oblivion and Fallout 3 are totally different types of games from top down 2D RPG's like Golden Sun and Pokemon. Just because Fallout is a newer type of game doesn't mean it is inherently better than a game like Pokemon Red. I think Modern FPS games have a lot of great qualities, but Goldeneye (and Perfect Dark) have a certain feel to it them likely won't ever be captured in a modern game. Modern blockbuster superhero movies match modern audience preferences better than a black and white silent films starring Charlie Chaplin, but for the discriminating eye, those old films have a certain feature that makes them excellent beyond simple historical  curiosity. \n\nAs a final point, don't compare Goldeneye to today's best first person shooters. Compare it to an average or terrible shooter. COD4 is arguably better than Goldeneye, but is [Duke Nukem Forever?](http://www.ign.com/articles/2011/06/14/duke-nukem-forever-review)\n\nSecond Response: \nMario 2 remains one of my favorite platformers.  Other games offer different things, but Mario 2 had this weird mix of qualities that just worked for me.  \n\nGoldeneye is never a game I got into, but I know plenty who have and still play it to this day.  You've named plenty of features, to be sure, but have left out a few things, like balance and feel.  Some people just like the way it plays.  \n\nSame thing with other \"antiquated\" things.

It positions its argument as one based on personal preference and influential design rather than solely a critique of functionality. In contrast, the second response lacks a similar conviction, appearing more anecdotal and less focused on counterarguments.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first responder uses comparisons that help contextualize the value of Goldeneye while drawing parallels to other beloved media (like music and films), making a case for its lasting significance that transcends mere gameplay mechanics. The second response relies on personal sentiment without providing substantial comparisons, which weakens its argumentative impact.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response is well-structured, mixing longer and shorter sentences effectively, which makes it engaging to read. Its use of structured arguments allows for easy navigation through its points. The second response, while coherent, is less structured and lacks clear transitions between points, making it feel more like a collection of thoughts rather than a cohesive argument.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response meticulously addresses the specifics of the original poster's claims about mechanics, controls, and map variety, demonstrating that it has taken the time to consider the original arguments deeply. It challenges the original poster\u2019s conclusion with reasoned points about balance and game feel. The second response is less engaging as it mostly revolves around personal preferences without directly addressing the weaknesses highlighted in the original post.\n\nGiven these elements, the first response is more likely to resonate with the original poster and effectively challenge their perspective on Goldeneye's value relative to modern games.", "is_correct": true}

Yes, people cited their religion for reasons, but ultimately that's what it would come back to (for the most part). Since 'genetic inferiority' is a scientific claim, it requires scientific evidence to support it. There is none, in fact there is plenty to disprove it. So interracial marriage happened without problem. (I like what other commenters have said about interracial marriage not changing the definition of marriage). \n\nOpposition to same-sex marriage is based on opposition to specific *actions*, and not wanting the government to sanction and support those actions. People who are opposed to same-sex marriage would also be opposed to two heterosexuals of the same sex getting married. The marrying couple's sexual *orientation* is not the target of disapproval, it's the *actions* of two individuals. (Yes, I am aware that many people who oppose same-sex marriage also actively hate or are at least grossed out by gay people--but that is irrelevant to a discussion of the possible social repercussions of legalizing same-sex marriage.) The fact that certain people are biologically predisposed to want to do those actions, and others are completely *not* interested in doing them, is a confusing side note to this argument. \n\nThis is a distinction that will probably be hard to make sense of, especially since I had trouble trying to explain it. Let me know if you have points you'd like clarified. \n\nI'd like to echo what others have said, and what has been said for the past several years: The government's interest in marriage is in harboring a place to raise successful citizens. Every solid study I've read up on shows that a child's best chance is to be raised by its biological parents*. Whenever possible, the government supports this with tax breaks and by attaching things like inheritance and hospital visitation rights to marriage. Since the child of same-sex partners cannot be raised by both biological parents, they are automatically at a disadvantage. At least, that's the argument. \n\n*I know there are studies out there that suggest that same-sex parents are just as likely to raise successful children as the biological parents. Every one of these studies that I've looked at has been deeply flawed--usually with non-random samples (parents who volunteer for a study about successful parenting are probably going to be the ones who are doing pretty well), extremely small sample sizes, or by comparing a population of same-sex parents that got their children through the difficult and expensive process of adoption to a population of heterosexual parents of all types--adopters, planned parents, accidental parents, etc. From what I understand, the meta-study the Supreme Court cited in their decision was a study of these flawed studies. Feel free to link a good study on same-sex parents. \n\nSecond Response: \nThe fundamental difference between state sanctioned interracial marriage and gay marriage is what they are promoting as a social norm. In interracial marriage the norm that is being promoted is that people do not need to be kept separate because of their racial characteristics, that integration of racial groups is a social good that we want to promote (or at least isn't an ill that should outweigh the good of marriage).\n\nGay marriage is an attempt to normalise a certain types of sexual relationships by raising their legal status and making them legally equivalent to others.\n\nThey are quite different things\u2026.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are the tone and emotional approach, engagement with the original post, and the clarity of points made by the second response.

What about when you are wrestling with a buddy and your dog thinks you are getting attacked and tries to save you?\n\nI agree that dogs don't really have the mental capacity to understand the complexities of friendship in a tit for tat type of way and their inner pack mentality will be a factor in how they operate but I don't think that make it impossible to have genuine feelings for their human companions.\n\nSecond Response: \nDogs demonstrate the same reactions to stimulus as they do to people.  That shows that they have some feelings about certain people.  For example, a dog gets a look at a leash and becomes excited and a bit raccous because it knows its going for a walk.  This is a reaction to a positive stimulus. A dog might demonstrate that same behavior when it sees its owner for the first time in a couple of days/weeks, clearly excited at the prospect of seeing its owner again.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are primarily rooted in tone, emotional appeal, and engagement.

{"index": 121, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV - in a truly libertarian economy, unions would rapidly become very powerful players, leading to a restablishment of a welfare state\n\nOriginal Post: \nEDIT: a portion of replies I'm getting are focused on the defination of 'libertarian' and the rainbow of american groups that claim it for their particular beliefs. If in doubt, replace 'libertarian' with 'minimally regulated, minimal government intervention' in the following argument.\n\n---\n\nDisclaimer, I'm a Brit who's also lived and worked in several developing countries, so I've seen first hand the damage, exploitation and general cost to societies of un-regulated (or highly corrupt) health and safety at work laws. I also don't have the same knee-jerk association of unions and criminal gangs that seems to prevail in discussions I've watched americans have. \n\n---\nThat said, let's move into the meat of the disscusion. \n1) a libertarian economy is not interfered with by the goverment. You want to force people to sign slavery contracts? it's allowed. By the same token however, there are no laws preventing people from forming unions, or those unions taking action to promote the interest of their members. If [the industry can maintain blacklists](http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/27/on-the-blacklist-building-firms-secret-information-on-workers), so can the unions. If ]a company decides to close stores to punish union members](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/walmart-accused-of-closing-stores-in-retaliation-for-workers-demanding-better-pay-and-conditions-10193668.html?origin=internalSearch), they run the risk of a rival firm that will work with unions taking the bulk of the sales in that area.\n\nAn antagonistic culture between unions and corporations is not the only option of course, and companies with forms that favour longer term thinking (like walmart, ironically) but also Waitrose in the uk (employee owned) might thrive when others get bogged down in strikes and penalties.\n\n2) unions get more and more effective the larger they get. At heart, they are simply rebalancing the power between a huge corporation and a single worker. The largest unions appeared in nationalised industries - the largest conglomerates of the day. There is a strong selection pressure for small unions themselves to form alliances, or even full unions with each other to increase their bargining power. An ineffective union will loose members to a more effective one and the market will deliver :)\n\n3) the unions themselves suffer the problem of free-riders. People who do not join but benefit from the union driving up minimum working standards and safety. If providing things like out-of-work support costs the union (and thus the corporations they work with) then companies that manage to avoid using union workforce will face a slight advatnage. As such, for strong unions, it is wise to agitate for political change, so that all workplaces have to conform to those same standards, that union type out of work support have to be applied to the entire workforce to prevent more predatory models from gaining a competitive advantage.\nThis also has the advantage, especially at the minimum level of starvation, slavery and loss of limb I've seen, of being a moral thing to do. \n\n4) Some people may have a very high risk tolerance (for whatever reason), and want to do without the safety nets and complain at the cost or inconvenience it puts on them as an employer, employee or as a tax payer. They will continue to complain, but when their individual demands conflict with organised forces, whether as a corporation, worker's union, or an insurance company, they will loose.\n\nFirst Response: \nUnions wouldn't exist at all because of free rider and collective action problems.  There are no laws that make unions illegal in right-to-work states in the US, and unions generally can't survive there because not enough people pay dues/join if they aren't forced to do so.   Also, it would be far too risky for an individual employee or small group to attempt to organize a union--the employer would just fire all of the organizers.  The only reason employees can organize unions now is because labor laws prohibit firing workers for union activity.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; unions get more and more effective the larger they get. At heart, they are simply rebalancing the power between a huge corporation and a single worker. \n\nYour thesis is a little all over the place, but this statement,in particular, is idealistic. Recently, Unions in LA demanded the right to negotiate for less than minimum wage for their workers? Why? Because they are losing members and by having union workers paid less, they would be more likely to have union people hired, and thus, union membership rolls would swell, and unions would earn more money. In other words, they were incentivized to act like the profit making organization they claimed to be fighting against.\n\nIn any case, Libertarians don't have a problem with private sector unions. But they tend to dislike laws that force people to pay union dues, even if those said people don't feel like the union is representing them in any meaningful way.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more critical yet measured tone, addressing the original poster's idealism head-on. It challenges the premises of the original argument with specific examples that demonstrate the practical limitations and flaws of unions, while the first response sounds more dismissive and absolutist in nature.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response effectively employs examples to illustrate its points, such as the situation with unions in LA negotiating for sub-minimum wages. This adds depth to the argument and engages with the original poster\u2019s views by challenging specific claims rather than broadly refuting the entire concept. In contrast, the first response primarily points to the mechanics of union survival in specific contexts without engaging critically with the broader argument.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response maintains clarity while offering complex ideas, allowing the reader to follow the thought process easily. The first response utilizes longer, more complex sentences which may hinder readability, making it less engaging.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response directly addresses and critiques a statement made by the original poster while also maintaining a more conversational tone. It opens a door for further discussion and invites the original poster to reconsider their stance. In contrast, the first response gives an impression of condescension and lacks an inviting dialogue, which may lead to defensiveness.\n\nOverall, the second response is more effective in reshaping the conversation and persuading the original poster to reconsider their view due to its grounded critique and constructive engagement.", "is_correct": true}

I believe altering Mother Nature is wrong and could cause (and probably already have) serious problems.\n\nOriginal Post: \n\nI do not support GMO's and do not want to consume them. Many other countries have restricted GMO's because they don't consider them safe alternatives. I personally don't believe that we should mess with the composition of the natural world. Especially on this level, where about 80% of our food is GMO in the U.S. We don't know enough about it to widely accept them in the country, as there could be long-term effects. We already know cancer, obesity, heart disease, autism, mental illness( especially anxiety and depression), and diabetes is a growing problem. \n\nWith this whole GMO labeling issue going on right now I definitely think everyone has the right to know what they are eating, because not everyone wants to consume food that's in essence a science experiment. \n\nFirst Response: \nI also agree that everyone has a right to know what they're eating. I disagree with just about everything else you've written.\n\n&gt; We don't know enough about it to widely accept them in the country, as there could be long-term effects.\n\nThere have been many, many studies that have demonstrated the safety of GMO crops. Let's start off by [reading the statement by the American Academy for the Advancement of Science](http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_GM_statement.pdf) that addresses many of the common concerns. I'll quote: \n\n* In order to receive regulatory approval\nin the United States, each\nnew GM crop must be subjected to\nrigorous analysis and testing. It must\nbe shown to be the same as the parent\ncrop from which it was derived\nand if a new protein trait has been\nadded, the protein must be shown\nto be neither toxic nor allergenic.\nAs a result and contrary to popular\nmisconceptions, GM crops are the\nmost extensively tested crops ever\nadded to our food supply. \n\n* The World Health\nOrganization, the American Medical\nAssociation, the U.S. National Academy\nof Sciences, the British Royal\nSociety, and every other respected\norganization that has examined the\nevidence has come to the same\nconclusion: consuming foods containing\ningredients derived from GM\ncrops is no riskier than consuming\nthe same foods containing ingredients\nfrom crop plants modified by\nconventional plant improvement\ntechniques.\n\n&gt; We already know cancer, obesity, heart disease, autism, mental illness( especially anxiety and depression), and diabetes is a growing problem.\n\nIf you're implying that consuming GMO foods causes any of these diseases, then you're wrong. Science disagrees with you. A [widely-circulated paper](http://www.skepticalraptor.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Seralini-Final-Paper.pdf) that claimed to show that GMO food caused health problems [has been debunked](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22287-study-linking-gm-crops-and-cancer-questioned/?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news). But those who rely on making the public afraid to promote their own agenda aren't usually receptive to proof that disproves their claims.\n\nLet me know if you need more proof /u/Londiebug13, there's a ton of research I could show you to demonstrate the safety of GMO foods.\n\nEdit: formatting.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe thing is that there is not any substantial, substantiated link between GMOs and any of the health concerns you have outlined. There have been many, many different studies done on GMOs in order to verify their safety, and only a small handful have turned up potential risks (and those studies had major flaws, and the results were not reproducible). \n\nAlso if you fear that your food may be a \"science experiment\", you should be surprised to learn that your fears should pretty much apply to every food you eat. As just one very small example, as a means of pest control, some organic crops are sprayed with natural insecticides produced by a type of bacteria  called *Bacillus thuringiensis*, because they are both \"natural\" and non-toxic to humans. Now the interesting thing about this is that one of the main strains of GMOs is genetically modified so that the plant itself produces this exact same protein, rather than having the protein (or the bacteria themselves) sprayed on it. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "In comparing the two responses, we can analyze several stylistic elements that may impact their effectiveness in persuading the original poster (OP) regarding GMOs.\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is confrontational and somewhat dismissive. Phrases like \"I disagree with just about everything else you've written\" set a combative tone. This response relies heavily on established authoritative sources but risks alienating the OP by undermining their concerns.\n   - **Second Response:** The tone is more informative and gently probing. The phrase \u201cThe thing is\u201d introduces a conversational tone, which might be more accessible. It suggests a willingness to engage rather than a definitive rebuttal, which can foster a more comfortable space for dialogue.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - **First Response:** The use of authoritative sources and direct quotes is strong, but the insightful engagement with the OP\u2019s specific fears is lacking.

This approach may resonate more effectively with the OP as it offers a perspective without outright dismissing their concerns.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - **First Response:** The structure is more formal and complex, involving lengthy passages of information.

I also jump from topic to topic without much transition, I apologize in advance for that.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the people that I look up to in life and seem to agree with all seem to support abortion. The people I see on the internet are supported for calling out someone who is against abortion, for instance reddit, to support abortion seems to be the widely regarded popular opinion. This probably isn't the best way to put it, but I seem to agree with every other popular political opinion on reddit (I should have thoughts of my own, and shouldn't form my opinions based upon some random website.) I like making fun of racist old assholes, I like making fun if homophobic old assholes, I like making fun of sexist old assholes, and I like making fun of religious old bigots, etc. etc. etc. But abortion seems to be the thing I disagree with, and I kind of feel like an asshole, like I must be missing some key point. I feel terrible that I have the opinion I do, because everyone seems to hate those who have it, and that's why I've come here, I must be missing some sort of point, and I hope that you can point it out for me. At first I just thought I didn't understand the issue well enough, but after I came to understand both sides of the debate, I can't help but wonder why everyone just accepts that a fetus isn't alive, and are kind of ignoring the moral implications of what if it's not? It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it). However I am going to counter my own argument here in saying that you can't prove that rocks aren't sentient either in the philosophical sense, but there is at least reason to believe that a fetus is more alive than a rock. When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality. Now I realize that it's not always consensual sex, and having to carry the child of someone who assaulted you is an absolutely horrendous thing, I would not wish that on my worst enemy, and I don't say that lightly, I really truly wouldn't. I can only imagine feeling as though I would just want to tear the child out no matter what. Never the less, life is life, a fetus is innocent, and the best I can recommend is some extreme therapy taken to whatever (healthy) extent necessary to help a person cope with such a thing. The \"it's going to happen anyway\" mindset I believe is just lazy, there are so many things on this planet that are going to happen anyway, are we just going to let them happen?\n\n\n\n\nOf those who are fine with people having a different opinion, it seems as though the popular opinion among them is that those who are anti abortion should shut up and keep it to themselves, don't bother anyone with it, but to be honest I even disagree with that, I don't get mad at those who picket abortion clinics, I don't see it as a bad thing to do, they literally see abortion as murder, even if you do support abortion, try to get in that mindset, seeing something as murder and being told to shut up and ignore it. (This is also why I don't get mad at animal rights activists, I've seriously considered going vegan, and I kind of think following my own philosophy, it's selfish and hypocritical of me that I'm not.) I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. We're having two different discussions and getting pissed at each other for not coming to the same conclusion. I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain. But please help me change my view, I feel like a total ignorant asshole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I feel like an asshole for being against abortion\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It's not that I think the fetus is necessarily alive, it's more along the lines that I don't think that you can prove that it's not alive (I genuinely don't think we will ever be able to definitively prove it).\n\nWhat do you mean by alive? From a biological perspective, a fetus is definitely alive, as is anything made up of cells. When you say alive, are you referring to consciousness? \n\nFor me, whether or not it is \"wrong\" to kill a fetus is basically dependent on whether or not the fetus values its own life (i.e. wants to stay alive/wants to not die). For me, this makes the question pretty clear cut throughout most of pregnancy. You need to be able to think (i.e. have a mind) to value your own life, and all evidence points to the necessity of brain activity in order to think. As a result, it is reasonable to assume that a fetus must have brain activity in order for it to value its own life (and by extension for it to be wrong to kill the fetus). Before about 24 weeks, a fetus doesn't have brain activity, so I assume that it doesn't value its life at least during those first 24 weeks, and that it is acceptable to kill it. Even when a fetus does develop brain activity, that doesn't mean that it will value its own life, but it's much easier to draw a line at existence/nonexistence of brain activity.\n\n&gt;I feel as though people are arguing two completely different things, a persons right to do what they want with their body, and a fetus's right to live. \n\nI think that the \"person's right to do what they want with their body\" argument is pretty ridiculous. I think this because (1) if you don't believe that a fetus is a person with a right life, then that argument really doesn't matter anyway because killing the fetus is OK (2) if you believe that a fetus is a person with a right to life, that argument essentially says that when person X's continued existence is sufficiently dependent on person Y, and person Y finds person X's continued existence inconvenient, they're allowed to kill X. \n\n&gt;I try to avoid spreading my opinions on the topic, because I feel as though it's not my place, I am a gay male, I will literally never have to worry about pregnancy. And maybe that's why I don't understand, maybe if it even remotely affected me my opinion would be different. I'm not certain.\n\nCall me hyperrational, but I think that that rational conclusions should not be swayed when you realize that they are hard to live with. They should only be changed when you encounter something that alters your base assumptions or when you realize that your reasoning was faulty. If you change your beliefs based on what advances your interests, then you might as well just stop attempting to justify them rationally in the first place.\n\nSecond Response: \nNobody is saying fetuses aren't alive. They are. They just should not be considered as *independent* organisms that are subject to moral principles. My hand is 'alive' in the same sense as a fetus is, but that doesn't mean cutting it off is the same as killing a person or animal. People often say fetuses develop into humans in time, therefore they are humans, but this does not account for the fact that they require the mother's body to do so. A zygote does not 'naturally' develop into a human without outside influence. \n\n&gt;When you have sex, you know it's a possibility to get pregnant, it's kind of like its part of the terms and conditions of sex, yeah it sucks but that's the reality.\n\nWhen you get in a car and drive somewhere, you know it's a possibility that some idiot may crash into you, regardless of how careful you are. Does that mean you implicitly 'accept' all the personal injuries and damages that result? If so, why should you get medical treatment to minimize these effects?\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses to the original post, we can identify some key stylistic elements that differentiate them, focusing on tone, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, and engagement with the original poster.\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n\n- **First Response:** The tone is more analytical and detached, aiming to address the original poster\u2019s concerns with logical reasoning rather than emotional appeal. The responder dissects and responds to specific points raised by the original poster, presenting a tightly constructed argument regarding the definition of life and the moral implications of killing a fetus.\n  \n- **Second Response:** This response has a critical yet confrontational tone. The phrasing suggests a certain level of exasperation with the common arguments surrounding the issue, framing the opposition's assertions in a dismissive way.

{"index": 124, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The only way to change the ignorant is with violence.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've (M) grown up in a very accepting family where they accept me for who I am and how I express myself. Now, I can't say that for some of my friends or the people who have gone through that with family or people in general.\n\n\nAs I was walking with my date (M) through town, a group of college students started laughing at us for holding hands. As we were walking by, I kept thinking of all the ways I could get them to stop because if they were to laugh at us, who else are they gonna make feel humiliated or disgusting. I felt like a pet. Some play toy. And that my life was humorous to other people.\n\n\nI can't say that there would be anything to say or do to make them realize that it's normal to appeal to the same sex. I'm ALL FOR education. I believe education makes the world go around and it's so perfect to learn abd understand new things about the world AND be open minded to everything. \n\n\nHowever, when I see a group of people act ignorantly, I can't help but clench my fist and think about raising hell in their life. The people they are are the kind that take pleasure in hurting people. Why? Because they want to do it for themselves. They can only think about themselves and that they're more perfect than everyone else.\n\n\nI sure as hell am not perfect. I resort to violence when it comes down to this topic. But when I hear or see ignorance made to hurt others, like this (https://youtu.be/1df_i26wh-w). I can't help but feel like this ignorance needs to be dealt with a punch in the face. Nobody deserves what I got. And nobody deserves the ignorance others recieve.\n\n\nIgnorance stems from close mindedness, which is something in this world we don't need. If we were all close minded, we wouldn't have advanced as far as we have. Do we really need more of it in this world? Is it necessary for our survival? I believe so to the extent that when there is an absolutely close minded person,there is an equally absolutely open minded person (the bell curve).\n\n\nSo to deal with these people is to punish them with hurt nowhere near the pain they've inflicted onto people, while still sending a message. CMV\n\n\nEdit: I know violence won't get me anywhere. Are there any other solutions besides time, education and ignorng other people that can remedy the situation more directly?\n\nFirst Response: \nFirst of all, let me just say that I understand how you feel. I've been in the same situation as you but not for the same reason. \n\nI'm from the US and during my middle school through early high school years, I went to school abroad in a non-english-speaking country. Ignorant remarks about my mastery of the english language were commonplace, with my peers often telling me to not speak English because I wasn't in the US, speak clearer, speak slower, and to go back to the US if I was going to speak English. Sometimes they would be joking, other times I feel not so much. \n\nViolence would not have solved anything. It's not like once I would've hit them they would have gone \"Wow, I guess this guy's right. He's changed my view entirely with a punch to my face\". No. They would have resented me, associated violence with being able to speak English correctly, and strengthened their opinion as true. \n\nThe fact is, ignorant people react this way to things that seem foreign to them because that's what they've been taught. Their negligent parents never taught them to be tolerant or that people can be with whomever they want. Or those types of reactions are applauded by their ignorant circle of friends. Or, in your case, they grasp at the opportunity to make sure their friends don't think they're gay too (though most of the time the people that make the most commotion out of it are usually the ones that are hiding something). \n\nUltimately, violence does not deter this kind of behavior. In the short run, yes: you can raise hell and they'll go away. But the next day they'll find someone that can't defend his or herself physically against these bullies and the ignorance continues. \n\nThe only thing in the world that solves ignorance is education. Not violence. And we're getting there. \n\nThink of it this way: homosexuality has been seen as bad for hundreds (if not thousands) of years, and the western world has undergone the transition from \"gays = weird, disease-ridden, etc.\" (ignorant, inaccurate descriptions) to just having legalized gay marriage a couple of weeks ago in the US. \n\nAs with most issues of ignorance in society, it takes a while to eradicate it. Blacks and Whites getting along as they do now (for the most part) was inconceivable to Americans of just 100 years ago. Look how far we are now. \n\nThe good news is that we're getting there. \n\nSecond Response: \nViolence takes many forms.  It can be physical (punching someone) or it can be more abstract like censorship (imposing will).  Violence is the use of force.  \n\nEndorsing violence to change close minded people is pretty circular.  One who uses violence as a tool to impose will is being just as close minded.  What you're really saying is \"they will never agree with my correct view, therefore I need to force them to change for the betterment of all.\" There's a utility to that but I personally believe it's dangerous.\n\nAdvocating discourse and advocating for violence are polar opposites.  It's ironic that someone from the LGBT community would advocate for the latter over the former, considering the fact that if you went back 100 years, it was majority heterosexuals seeking to impose their will via violence to curb homosexuality.  Now, we find that sort of behavior atrocious.  \n\nDiscourse however allows for the free flow of thoughts and ideas to change the minds and hearts of others.  It's the whole purpose of this sub and its power speaks for itself.  \n\nI think you're being absolute in saying the close minded people can never change.  \n\nAnd only a Sith deals in absolutes....\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include the second responder's nuanced argumentation and their engagement with both the emotional and intellectual aspects of the original poster's argument. Here\u2019s a breakdown:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response employs a slightly more balanced and philosophical approach, inviting the original poster to reconsider their stance without dismissing their feelings entirely. While the first response recounts a personal experience and acknowledges shared emotional experiences, it comes off as more didactic. The second response engages in a calmer, more reflective discussion about violence and its implications, which encourages critical thinking.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second responder utilizes a form of irony and analogy (referencing historical oppression of the LGBTQ+ community) which not only contextualizes the emotional pain of the original poster but also prompts them to consider the broader ramifications of endorsing violence. This technique is more thought-provoking compared to the first response, which primarily focuses on personal anecdotes.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response has a more varied sentence structure, which maintains engagement and facilitates a deeper understanding of its arguments. It balances complex ideas with clear reasoning, making it more digestible than the first response, which, while impactful, tends to be more straightforward and less layered.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response directly addresses the original poster\u2019s perceptions and challenges them\u2014specifically regarding the belief that violence can be justified as a means to change minds. This engagement suggests a respectful confrontation of ideas, promoting dialogue rather than an outright rejection of the poster's feelings, unlike the first response which, while empathetic, does not deeply challenge the notion of violence as a solution.\n\nIn summary, the second response's broader philosophical approach, rhetorical strategies, and deeper engagement likely resonate more effectively with the original poster, potentially leading to a reconsideration of their viewpoint.", "is_correct": false}

Meaning, minorities/persons of color/foreign nationals cannot be racist because they do not benefit from their discrimination. Whereas the majority are inherently racist because they are privy to a system, be it political or societal, that favors their ethnicity.\n\nI don't understand how definitively discriminatory actions cannot be considered racist, because of the characteristics of a person.

I think you may have misunderstood one or more of the arguments that have lead some to suggest that minorities can't be  racist or practice racism. *Anyone* can discriminate or act bigoted or discriminatory. But from a sociological standpoint, *racism* is more than simple discrimination. \n\nSure: some will quote dictionary.com and say that 'racism' is any discrimination or bigotry based on race. But that 'by the book' definition doesn't really help us address root causes of societal inequality. There's a sketch on the TV show *Upright Citizens Brigade* in which a racist character looks to find a group to direct his racism toward that won't be damaging and unacceptable and settles on the Laplanders (residents of the extreme north of Norway, Sweden, and Finland - about 200,000 people). The joke is that a white, middle-American guy being racist toward Laplanders is almost as good as being non-racist: in that his racism will be very unlikely to affect anyone in his daily life (of course, because this is comedy, he suddenly encounters Laplanders everywhere and is forced to again confront his racism).\n\nA member of a minority group being 'racist' (bigoted or discriminatory) toward white people is just like a white guy discriminating against Laplanders. On the one hand -society's general preference for white people makes his discrimination more or less non-effective. So few minorities are in positions of authority where they could even effectively discriminate against majority groups; fewer still will achieve those positions by being overtly discriminatory against the majority. Only ultra-insular communities would ever permit a minority person to attain a rank sufficient to discriminate against majority persons: think ultra-orthodox religious communities or radical racial groups. Mainstream whites aren't trying to join Hasidic Jewish synagogues or the Black Panthers any more than blacks are trying to join the KKK. \n\nSure: excluding *anyone* from *any* group based on race is the dictionary definition of 'racism'. But you have to ask yourself - does excluding members of a majority group from insular, race-based identification societies damage those excluded in any way? Aside from hurting their feelings, are members of the majority racial or ethnic groups damaged in a systematic fashion by bigotry and discrimination by members of minority groups? If not, I don't think that 'racism' is a correct label to apply.\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To compare the two responses, we will examine several stylistic elements that could influence which one may better change the original poster's view.\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- **First Response:** The tone is somewhat dismissive and confrontational, utilizing a comparison (\"it's like you're saying starvation in America is just as bad as it is in Haiti\") that could come across as patronizing. It attempts to illuminate the power dynamics at play in current societal structures but does so with an underlying frustration that might alienate the OP.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is more explanatory and nuanced. It addresses the OP's misunderstanding with a sense of understanding while providing sociological context to the argument. This tone is less combative and more inviting of dialogue, which may foster a better connection with the OP.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- **First Response:** It employs analogies to communicate a point effectively, but the analogy used could also be perceived as too extreme. It tends to focus on reinforcing a singular narrative about power and privilege without providing sufficient space for the OP's perspective.\n- **Second Response:** The response draws on a cultural reference (a comedic sketch) to illustrate its point, making the argument relatable and accessible. It elaborates on the sociological underpinnings of racism versus discrimination, which adds depth to the explanation.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- **First Response:** The sentence structure is somewhat convoluted, with longer sentences that may require multiple readings to fully grasp the argument. The complexity of thoughts might overwhelm the OP.\n- **Second Response:** The response uses varied sentence lengths and formatting (including italicizing key terms) to enhance readability. The writing flows logically from one point to the next, making it easier for the OP to follow the argument.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- **First Response:** Although it mentions the OP's confusion, it doesn't engage with them constructively. Instead, it reinforces the OP's misunderstanding rather than guiding them toward a more comprehensive understanding.\n- **Second Response:** It directly addresses the OP's statements and provides clarifications and examples that demonstrate an understanding of the OP\u2019s position.

I love my wife, and I love my children, but I am not a fan of Father's Day. I feel the \"holiday\", if one can call it that, forces people to adopt a tradition that bills itself very similarly to a birthday...which I already have once a year. If you want to appreciate someone it should be done on an individual basis and *not* based on some yearly Hallmark Holiday. Yes, I feel the same about Mother's Day, but I'll be damned if I don't go through the motions.  \n\nI feel much the same way about many of the other \"appreciation days\" (e.g. Administrative Professionals Day, Thank a Mailman Day, etc.). You are thanking someone for doing what they *chose* to do. Society should not force an expectation on others to give you praise for the things you choose to do or become. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You exist!  We get to celebrate the fact that you are in our lives and are special for existing!\"  Now, this doesn't mean I don't love the birthday-person the other 364 days of the year, but their birthday gives me an excuse to make that love and appreciation tangible.  (And to be a bid morbid, people do choose to have birthdays; they can always \"opt out.\")\n\nAnd so I feel much the same way about \"Appreciation Days.\"  It's not about them to \"reap the benefits\" of something they chose to do, but rather for the rest of us to say \"Yay, you did something, and we are really quite happy you did!\"  \n\nFinally, Appreciation Days also allow people to feel less guilt about being lavished with loot.  I don't have a dad, so I can't speak for Father's Day, but if I gave my mom gifts every time I felt appreciation for her existence, she'd feel guilty for all the money I was spending.  But because Mother's Day exists, I can get her a nice gift and she has to go \"Well, okay then.\"\n\nNow, if you have people in your life that few the appreciation of you on Father's Day as a burden, then I wouldn't like that day either.  But if you have people who look at it as an *opportunity*, then it's for them, not you, and I say give them free rein to say \"Yay!\"\n\nSecond Response: \nMost holidays are hard to justify on paper. Why celebrate someone's birthday? It's really just an arbitrary marker that bears little on an individual's actual development. Christmas is a scam. Halloween is a scam. Easter (if you're not religious) is a scam. Mother's day: scam. On and on.\n\nBut you know what? I like these days, I don't care if they were pushed into being by cold and uncaring corporations. They are a part of our culture, and we chose to make that so. \n\nYou could say that companies were just responding to a need (days of celebration) evidenced by how well they were received and embedded into the fabric of our culture. There are many 'holidays' you've never heard of, because they were never accepted by the public at large. The ones we celebrate, we celebrate for a reason.\n\nIgnoring the consumerism for a moment, what I find important about these days is it does give you time to reflect. Mother's Day makes us ask ourselves \"Have I been showing my mom how much I love her?\" In the day to day hustle of life, it's easy to lose track of these things. Ideally, we'd never need a day, we'd just be thankful and appreciative all year round. But we tend to be focused on our own needs most of the time. Father's Day helps raise our awareness about what it means to be a good dad, or a good son or daughter for that dad.\n\nI'm not going to try convincing you to love Father's Day, but I would urge you not to \"hate\" it. My dad actually sounds quite a bit like you, and honestly it saddens me the way he is. He is so hyper aware of social manipulation of this kind that he loses perspective. He takes on a cynical attitude towards these trappings and so becomes less emotionally receptive as a result. He thinks he's rebelling against culture, but really, he's just rebelling against his own family, closing off one small avenue to help strengthen bonds.\n\nIn the end, he accomplishes nothing with his rebellion in terms of reshaping culture, and ultimately starts to seem more a curmudgeon than anything. Being in such vehement opposition to something as trivial as a holiday doesn't make you brave or heroic, it just makes you an ass (not saying this about you personally, just in general). \n\nYour view of the world shapes reality. If you see Father's Day as consumerist bullshit, that is exactly what it will be for you. You will act in such a manner as to make it so. It's very easy to pick up on the vibe of your parents and respond in kind. Your kids could have had an opportunity to be extra loving on this day with you, and you could respond in turn. But alas, you are simply too above it. Too above a good excuse to be a bit kinder to each other. Is that really something worth fighting for? Is that the person you want to be? Is that how you want your kids to be?\n\nJust try this. Be stupid for a day. On Father's Day, take it just as seriously as marketers would like you to. Get excited about all the gestures of kindness, material or otherwise, and make your appreciation clear to your family. You will be surprised to discover, that forced excitement and appreciation becomes real. What was before only a formality, becomes a catalyst for real emotional connection. When your family sees your warm reception, it will make them happy, which in turn will make you happy. Instead of reinforcing a cycle of cynicism, you are now reinforcing a cycle of love and kindness. Does it actually really matter how the day came about? You have an opportunity here, fucking *use it*.\n\nLife may ultimately be meaningless, but each day we have the ability to create real meaning for ourselves, our friends, and our family. Father's Day may be bullshit, but it also represents one small opportunity to find true meaning. Not just find it, but to make it. To fail to understand this is to fail to make the best use of this short time we have.\n\n\n^(This post sponsored by Hallmark.)\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "When comparing the two responses to the original post about disliking Father's Day, several stylistic elements emerge that play crucial roles in predicting which response may have effectively changed the original poster's view.\n\n### First Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response carries a positive and encouraging tone.

{"index": 127, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The SJW movement uses language of the elite and privileged, and thus does very little to empower or educate.\n\nOriginal Post: \nLet me preface this by saying that I consider myself socially liberal, and I actually agree with *most* SJW talking points. Like other left-leaning movements, it seems to have good intentions, but I actually think it does more to silence non-privileged voices than it does to encourage education, empowerment, progress, or harmony.\n\nA college education (or at the very least, the Internet and plenty of time on one's hands) seems to be a standard cost of entry for dialogue with a typical SJW. Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as: patriarchy, heteronormativity, trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF), cisgendered, gender spectrum, gentrification, respectability politics, privilege, oppression, identity, assimilation, queer, otherkin, institutionalization, marginalization, etc....I could keep going.\n\nThese are all terms that I've just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pages/comments. Some are more easily defined than others, but there are still layers to each concept (such as privilege or oppression) that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time they've been exposed to these ideas.\n\nHonestly, I have a master's, and the first time this language was thrown my way, I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent, specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words, but how is someone who doesn't have the privilege of a college education, or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts, expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like it's spoken by a women's studies textbook? It can be intimidating, and no one likes to have a conversation that makes them feel stupid. How is this use of privileged language encouraging those who are economically and educationally marginalized to participate?\n\nI don't want to generalize, but from my own experience, a majority of SJWs enjoy doing what they do because they like winning arguments. It's not about empowering and educating. In the face of ignorance, SJWs tend to belittle and insult, rather than educate or allow for a balance dialogue. The attitude is, \"Oh, you're ignorant? Let me make you feel *more* ignorant by insulting you and using words you don't understand.\"\n\nAgain, I'm in favor of most ideas SJWs tend to champion...transgender rights, #BlackLivesMatter, feminism, etc. I just think they're going about it in a way that turns people off, because they're so concerned with being able to flex their knowledge and with shutting down those who might disagree with their ideas the tiniest bit.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Mind you, a lot of \"SJW's\" are college students, they're used to this style of talk about social issues and mimic it on tumblr. The way it's always been with social activism is that there's a sort of \"ivory tower\" side and a more \"hands on\" side to it. \n\nThe latter organizes youth groups, teaches people about racism on their local school or community center, it organizes things like pride parades and history month celebrations.\n\nThe former is deliberately all talk, its efforts go towards identifying and naming the phenomenons that surround the injustice and discussing solutions. \n\nThis is not a new thing at all, take socialism for example, you had the academic elite discussing about concepts with big words and citations to lofty philosophers, there was the side that came in contact with people and riled them up or informed them. Also take how sociology professors talk about microagressions and mental colonization, while black advocacy groups take those ideas and rather than preaching about them go into action to stop them. None of them does more than the other, they need each other to be effective and thorough.\n\nI think there are several problems with how \"SJW's\" are handling activism, but their academic or pseudo-academic approach is not it. Refusing to educate others is regressive and a problem, yes of course, but the fact that advocacy includes complicated concepts and words is a nonissue. \n\n\nSecond Response: \nOn the subject of specialized language, couldn't you say the same thing for pretty much *any* specific area of discussion?  For example, American football has dozens of similarly inaccessible words for those who haven't taken the time to look them up.  These words aren't any harder to learn than any other.  It just so happens that some words (and the things they represent) come up less often in everyday conversation, so the average person is less likely to already be familiar with them.  This is not even the slightest bit unique to \"SJW\" words.  \n\nExample: if you asked me what a linebacker was, I would have absolutely no idea what the answer was, besides that it's a position in football.  (And for the record, I'm a 20-something year old male living in North America.)  Yet I don't accuse football of being elitist because I haven't bothered to check what these words mean before trying to talk football with people who have.  As for when there are lots of \"layers to each concept,\" what does this really mean?  These layers exist not because of some SJW conspiracy to keep outsiders out, but because ideas like privilege and marginalization are genuinely complex issues that you can't become an expert on overnight.  \n\nBut you can still do some basic research on simple definitions quite easily, and learn the rest as you go along - just as you would with literally any other complex idea.  I don't think that's too much to ask, and it's what education is fundamentally about to begin with.  It seems strange to accuse something of \"doing little to educate\" on the grounds of there being lots of things to learn.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor in leading to this prediction is the Second Response's effective use of analogy and relatability to counter the original poster's concern about the elitism of specialized language in the SJW movement. By comparing the jargon of social justice to the specialized language in football, it emphasizes how many fields have their own complex terminology that can be learned over time rather than being inherently exclusive. This argument normalizes the use of complex language and frames it as part of the broader learning process, which may appeal to the original poster\u2019s own experience with SJW concepts.\n\nAdditionally, the Second Response employs a calm, logical tone, aiming to educate rather than belittle, which appears to engage the original poster\u2019s concern about communication and empowerment effectively. It also points out that the complexity of ideas is rooted in fundamental truths rather than obstructionist tendencies, which could help soften the original poster's perception of SJWs.\n\nIn contrast, while the First Response offers valid points regarding the coexistence of academic discourse and grassroots activism, it doesn't directly tackle the original poster's view regarding elitism or make an effort to bridge understanding as effectively as the Second Response. Thus, the Second Response is more likely to sway the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 128, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If religion magically disappeared one day, I don't think the violence would be any different\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe likes of /r/atheism argue that most of the world's problems come from religion, and that a post-religion world would be miles better.\n\nAs humans, we inherently drive ourselves into groups based on similarities. Sometimes, these groups bunch up against each other. Eventually, the groups will want to expand over the same area. Each group thinks that they are the sole group worthy of that land, and that they must display this worthiness by stopping anyone that gets into their way. \n\nYou could replace the word \"group\" with anything: religion, race, color, etc. Sure, religion's the largest group, but if religion were to disappear any day, there would still be sectarian fighting. You'd hear news about conflicts between the \"Arab Nationalist Front\" and the \"Pashtun Defense Brigade\" instead of ISIS that could be just as violent as religious conflict. \n\nTL;DR: If humans weren't killing each other over religion, they'd be killing each other over ethnicity or race. \n\nFirst Response: \nYou have said that eliminating religion wouldn't eliminate sectarian violence, and of course it wouldn't. That kind of violence will always exist, and anyone who tells you otherwise is speaking with a mind full of utopia. That being said, just because something isn't the only factor playing a part in violence doesn't mean it plays no part at all. Nationalism, racism, religion - when taken to their furthest implications - will almost always result in some kind of fanaticism, which is exactly why religion **does** play a vital role in the amount of violence we see today.\n\nReligion is unique in the sense that it can provide someone the promise of post-life reward. Someone active in the military may be fighting for the idea of securing their family's safety, or the safety of their country, yes, but even that army can't promise that soldier an **eternal** benefit for their contribution.

The answer is that many religious ideologies either promise an eternal reward **for** doing it (i.e. heaven), or an eternal punishment for **not** doing it (hellfire and the like).\n\nSure, one could chalk all of this up as certain people using religion as an excuse to make others \"do their dirty work.\" Even I once believed that every time religious violence showed up on the news, that it was only a bad apple or two, and that the religion itself played no part in it happening. But eventually I had to face the terrifying truth in front of our faces today; in pretty much every holy book there are callings for true believers to wreak havoc on those who don't believe. While Islam is the most often accused of [breeding fanatics](http://www.vexen.co.uk/religion/islam_unbelievers.html), it's worthy of noting that [the Bible also calls upon true Christians to shed blood.](http://www.humanreligions.info/violence_and_crime.html#Christianity) In Matthew 10:34, Jesus Christ of Nazareth himself said that he came to earth, [\"not to send peace, but a sword.\"](http://www.holybooks.info/matthew.html#Chapter10) Hell, even [Buddhist and Hindu scriptures](http://www.humanreligions.info/violence_and_crime.html#Scriptures) contain justifications for murder.\n\nThere are a handful of ideas so gripping, so compelling that someone would be willing to die for them. Sometimes their influence is so strong that they won't stop at killing themselves, sometimes it's so strong that killing other people isn't off the table, either. Sadly, religion falls into this category. It all comes down to interpretation of a religion's core principles, the way its followers interpret its holy book(s). And while it is true that a majority of any of these religions will condemn the ones murdering, there are noticeable communities within these faiths that are willing to kill in the name of the faith. Getting rid of religion wouldn't eliminate all crime, but it would be childish to say that, with all of these dogmas done away with, there wouldn't be **any** noticeable difference in violence around the world.\n\n**EDIT:** While I don't think I strayed from being as objective and unbiased as possible, some seem to have taken my comment as an antireligious sentiment. This is false. I support the practice of all religion and believe it plays a huge part in cultures and the growth of communities around the world. The purpose of the comment is to change OP's view (which is the point of this subreddit, IIRC) that violence in a world without religion would be in no way, shape or form different than violence in a world with religion. It in no way calls for the abolishment of religion, which is something I would disagree with personally.\n\n**EDIT #2:** Something that's interesting to me is that some of you have criticized what you perceive to be bias against Christianity, or Hinduism or Buddhism, in the sources I provided. However, the claims against Islam leading to violence have simply been left alone. This leaves a question in my mind: if Islam alone was done away with, would violence in the world be any different at all? I think we'd all agree it would. And if you said yes, then wouldn't it, by definition, be different if religion as a whole was gone?\n\nSecond Response: \nLet's imagine a hypothetical. There is a religion based on a holy book that is only one sentence long: \"If you kill someone above the height of 6' you will go to paradise\" Now imagine that this is one of the most widely believed religions in the world.\n\n\n\nIt's easy to imagine how the existance of this religion could make the world more violent. As a person above 6' tall I would certainly look over my shoulder more often. It would also be fair to assume that violence against tall people would increase. Would some people who were prone to violence anyway use this as an outlet? Certainly. Would the organization into this religion cause groups to form which would otherwise form anyway under nationalism? Probably. But all it takes is one person who would be otherwise a normal and peaceful person, in full belief that killing a person about 6' would send him to paradise, in order to make it a more violent world. Can you imagine a person, with complete and utter confidence in this doctrine, who would be motivated to kill? If it truly were one of the most popular in the world you can expect the number of people who are motivated by this religion alone to kill someone above 6' to be massive. However, even if only say 10,000 believed it you could still expect it to be a more violent world, as some amount of those 10,000 would be motivated to kill. So I think we can agree that a world in which this religion were believed in any capacity would be more violent than the one we live in now.\n\n\n\nThis hypothetical is a direct parallel to the world we live in with regards to Islam. Within the doctrine of Islam lies the idea that if you martyr yourself killing infidels, you will be rewarded in paradise. The only difference is that Islam is a much more convoluted religion with many interpretations, some of which repudiating martyrdom. Yet sects of Islam for which Martyrdom is a prominent feature do exist, and in no small number, and a significant amount of these believers have enacted and are enacting suicide attacks. Even if radical versions of Islam are not immensely popular (though they are far more popular than most people suppose), by the same logic that we concluded that the belief in the hypothetical religion in any capacity makes the world more violent can also be applied to radical Islam. It is not a difference of kind, it is a difference of scale. If any number of people, however small, believe that blowing themselves up in a crowded area will get them into paradise, religion directly causes the world to be more violent.\n\n\n\nWhile you may think that the number of radical Islamists is negligible, you must concede that it is a difference in scale only. Your assertion was that \"If religion magically disappeared one day, I don't think the violence would be any different.\" If you concede that the disappearance of radical Islam would make the world less violent in any way, then you must change your view.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Engagement and Emotional Tone**: The First Response directly engages with the original poster's arguments by acknowledging their perspective and then contrasting it with a more nuanced view.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nLet me start by saying I'm a fan of Win *8.1* (the .1 being the key there).  And still appreciate what Win8 was trying to do.  So my arguments more or less here are to understand why there are a lot of people who hate it.  I think it's also worth mentioning that Win8 brings a lot of great things to the table (new explorer, new task manager, better under the hood performance, etc) but depending on the person, they probably don't care.\n\n&gt; The main complaint seems to be the start screen replacing the start menu.\n\nThe problem is that it's considered a really jarring experience for a lot of people, and they don't like that.  So in order to access your programs in Win7 if they weren't pinned to the bar you could just open up the menu while still having a complete view of the desktop.  With Win8 however, going into the Start Screen completely tears you out of your working environment so you can access your programs not pinned to the bar.  So for some that only have a handful of programs pinned to their Start it's incredibly annoying to have an *entire* screen fill up your desktop rather than a small menu on the side.\n\nAnother issue (which I still kinda have with it, even though it doesn't happen often) is when you accidentally hit the Win key it pulls you out of whatever you're working on and into a completely different screen.  In Win7 if this happened all you'd see is the menu pop up and you'd just click off it to get back to work.  In Win8 you have to find the Desktop tile and click that, or strike the key again.  The process is non-ideal.\n\nI also feel that it could have been executed a lot better as far as tile organization goes.  You can do two sizes, and stack them in a column.  I think they should have taken the \"snap to grid\" approach for icons on the desktop to allow you to stick tiles anywhere on the Start screen rather than just form columns and hope they align with your OCD.\n\n&gt;  if you really hate it you can install something like classic shell to bring back to the start menu\n\nI'm an advocate of this, however you have to remember that the majority of PC users are *not* incredibly bright.  So for instance if my father wanted to get a new laptop then he's got to figure all that stuff out on his own (not likely), I need to babysit him through the process on the phone, or I need to just do it myself.  And since it's a third party software, it's possible that it'll break for one reason or another in which case either he's got to fix it (not likely) or I need to fix it (annoying).\n\n&gt; To change my view here you should tell me if there's something worse than the start screen in Windows 8 that makes it that bad. Or if the start screen really is that bad.\n\nSo depends on who you are.  I don't mind the Start screen but there are a lot of people who absolutely *loathe* it.\n\nOther things wrong with Win8:\n\n - Charms menu.  Every time my cursor wanders over to a corner I get an annoying Charms menu pop up.  If I have a multi monitor setup (which I do now) if I *do* want to get to the Charms I have to balance my cursor between screens, making it nearly impossible to get on a single try.  It's also kinda useless.  I've nearly forgotten it's there on my desktop since all of its functionality is available elsewhere (at least from what I've used).\n - Lack of Start button (fixed with 8.1).  In Win8 there was no Start button, so the only way to get to the Start menu was hitting the Win key or going all the way to the corner with the cursor.  Annoying.\n - Shut down (fixed in 8.1, kinda).  In Win8 if you want to restart/shut down/sleep it's a several key/click process.  You need to get to the start menu, then open the charms bar, then select settings, then power options, then select what you wanna do.  It's a kind of hidden process, and really annoying if you don't know how to do it.  Once you do know, you think \"why is this a several step process when it should be like Win7?\".  Win 8.1 *kinda* fixes this by allowing you direct access with a right click of the Start button, or directly on the Start Screen.  I say *kinda* because a right click is non-ideal and non-obvious and putting it on the Start screen means you still need to use the Start Screen.\n - Direct to Start Screen on boot (fixed in 8.1, with a settings change).  Booting up goes right to the Start Screen rather than the desktop.  Annoying.  Fixed with a settings option in 8.1, but it should be default.\n - Full screen apps (kinda fixed with 8.1).  Full screen apps on a desktop (or even laptop) are a terrible idea.  Win 8.1 kinda fixes this by docking them on the taskbar, but full screen apps are still a terrible idea.  They need to be windowed or the option to have them windowed, period.  For someone who wants to look at more than one thing (laptop and desktop users) having Mail taking up your entire screen is a drag.\n - General hidden features.  Things that should be obvious are hidden.  You need to hunt a corner to pop a menu out, accessing \"all apps\" from the Start Screen there's a *hidden* arrow button, right clicking contextually to find things (like the shut down point before) etc.  Not to mention all the stuff buried in the Charms bar.  There's too much hidden stuff that's only nice if you already know where it is.\n - General touch-oriented approach.  A lot of stuff is designed with touch in mind, like the Tiles.  Great if you have a touchscreen, and janky looking if you don't. \n - Too much tied in with MS.  They really try to get you to make an MS account, and tie your login with said account.  I absolutely hate that.  It makes things like Onedrive on the desktop inaccessible because of this integration, as opposed to just having the application take whatever credentials it needs.  If you chose to shirk making and signing in with an MS account, you lose some of the perks Win8 brings to the table.\n - Multiple PC settings areas.  So you've got the standard Control Panel, then you've got this \"Settings\" area that has some repetition from Control Panel, then some other stuff not in Control Panel that should be integrated into just Control Panel.  It's also a full screen app...ughhhh.  So if you wanna set something, you have to hunt through an already kinda cryptic Control Panel, but also through this new Settings app.\n - Repetition of functionality.  There's a lot of different ways to do one thing.  Shut down is yet again an example of this.  Device management is another (Control Panel, Settings app, Charms bar).  Search is another (Win+S, Start menu then type something, Charms bar).  There is way too much repetition.\n\nSo all in all, if you're not a savvy user (like most) then updating is a real pain in the ass.  8.1 does fix a lot of flaws 8 had, and Win10 supposedly brings a lot of that stuff even closer to Win7 (Start menu).  Win10 is what Win8 should have been.\n\nAnd in reality, there's ways around just about every nit up there.  Problem is, that if you have to find a way around something in order to get to experience the better things and improvements Win8 has to offer then that's a bad thing and deserving of a lot of the hate that Win8 has garnered.\n\nSecond Response: \nIn 1994-1995, there were a bunch of \"alternative shell\" programs launched for Windows 3.1. Most prominent among them were Microsoft Bob and Packard Bell Navigator.\n\nThey were intended to make computers simpler, friendlier, easier to use thanks to more familiar UI elements.\n\nThey were a massive failure, in part because their supposedly-intuitive UIs were anything but, and in part because they were so limited\u2014a lot of functionality was buried, you had no idea what you could or couldn't interact with or what anything would do, and you just couldn't do certain things without exiting the \"friendly\" UI and returning to the real OS.\n\nWindows 8 is that, but worse. It's grafted into the OS, rather than merely overlaying it. It's mostly ignorable, but there's just enough designed-for-touchscreen elements (which are explained... once... the first time the computer ever turns on while running that version of Windows) that are vital to day-to-day life that you can't just pretend it doesn't exist. Like the Charms menu in order to reboot or power down, or tying the native web browser and SkyDrive to the new \"modern\" UI, or the nightmare that is trying to sort the start screen. Even if you like the new start screen\u2014I personally think it looks pretty nifty\u2014it's not really very *good.* (I always preferred Launchy to the Start Menu, so that wasn't a problem for me, but it's certainly a problem for a lot of other people.)\n\nAnd that half-baked, Frankenstein's monster of a solution was really a shame. I liked Windows 8. I still like Windows 8, and I'm looking forward to Windows 10\u2014the improvements to network file sharing code, file move/copy, the task manager, and overall RAM use are all really good benefits, and bumping my work computer from 7 to 10 is going to be a delight. But 8 was badly-designed software, even if you could ignore most of the bad parts if you knew what you were doing.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor in this prediction lies in the depth and detailed engagement the first response provided. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response maintains a relatively balanced tone while clearly expressing the challenges many users face with Windows 8.

{"index": 130, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: after watching Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, I think TV shows' quality is bad and I don't want to bother seeing any more of it. [Warning: spoilers ahead.]\n\nOriginal Post: \nBefore you downvote me, please hear me out and try to CMV with a well articulated comment. I would like to keep this a civil discussion without resorting to shutting people up with downvotes.\n\nI will try to explain my opinion.\nWARNING: looong rant ahead.\n\nI first watched Breaking Bad. \nI've never been into TV shows since they tend to be time consuming and (IMO) tend to appeal to a broader audience, but since everyone told me to watch it I did. \n\nThere are definitely some high points in the show: Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Giancarlo Esposito gave terrific performances, and without them I think the show would not have had the success it had. \nGus' arc is IMO the peak of the show, with Gus' back story and general awesomeness. \nThe other characters though, feel irrelevant and without much to offer. There is the cop who conveniently discovers Heisenberg's identity on the toilet, his wife who is just... There, and the same goes for Walter's son. Skylar is a hypocrite and exists only to judge others from her morality horse. The other villains are forgettable and the psycho that appears towards the end of the show is a convenient plot device to kill Jesse's love interest and doesn't have any interesting trait. He's completely unidimensional. \nIn the end, the series felt like an action movie with a few interesting characters and some pretty good cinematography, but nothing mind blowing. \n\nI still liked it though and I can see why people like it but if this is considered the best TV show ever, then I question TV shows' quality. \n\n\nNow for Game of Thrones: I didn't read the books nor do I intend to unless it's significantly better than the show. \n\nI will try to keep my cool but I really DESPISE this show. I feel about it the same way I feel about Attack On Titan (yes, I hate that one too): interesting premise, terrible characters and pacing, and lots of CHEAP. SHOCK. VALUE. \n\nThe show always goes for the most shocking outcomes for the sake of shock value. People praise this show for being unpredictable and killing off anyone without distinction. Yet all the people who die are COMPLETE FUCKING IDIOTS and their deaths feel forced to avoid, god forbid, that the story might start getting going. \n\nWhen the Stark guy knows the King's wife has an incestous affair and suspects her to have tried to kill a fucking child, the guy who loves his wife tells him not to trust him and his daughter tells him about people wanting him DEAD he just claims the Iron Throne without considering that maybe, just MAYBE, he could get arrested/killed. \n\nHe could singlehandedly fix the corruption of the South, or at least try to while others tried to kill him, but we can't have that, now can we? The story must keep not going anywhere. If his death could have been at least plausible then it would have been okay.\n\nThen there is the dragon girl, who gets married to someone she doesn't love, is raped and then just falls in love with him. Dafuq, Stockholm's syndrome maybe?\n\nAnd at the end of season 3 we have other Starks dying because they're complete fools. Marrying another woman when you have already promised to marry the daughter of a powerful ally sure is a bright move, Einstein! After that I just dropped the series.\n\nIt's just like a soap opera, with tons of violence and sex, where characters who are considered \"grey\" are just flat without any interesting development other than the dwarf (I don't even remember those guys names) and maybe the Stark tomboy little girl and the Stark who is at the Night Watch. There is a woman with an incestous affair with his pretty brother, a king who likes drinking, eating and fucking, a king who's a naive imbecile, a dragon girl with Stockholm's syndrome who becomes a badass cuz DRAGONS, a psychopathic teen king who somehow still hasn't died in 3 seasons, a guy whose penis makes the thinking and dooms his family to death, etc. \n\nTHIS is considered good TV. If this is the best TV has to offer, then I don't even want to bother watching any more of it.\n\nPlease try to CMV.\n\nFirst Response: \nYou're missing the point of the shows you name to a certain extent. Breaking Bad isn't about exploring a wide cast of characters, it's about drilling down into the core of a select few characters with a primary focus on Walt. Characters like Hank, Marie, and Walt Jr. are really only relevant to the purpose of the show in how they affect Walt (I'd argue this is true about all characters besides Walt, but that's an argument for another time). \n\nGame of Thrones isn't about characters always doing the most intelligent, logical thing. If anything, it's the opposite: it's a study of the tragedies that inevitably follow from character traits (often traits that are usually seen as positive). Ned Stark's greatest fault is that he's so honest, honorable, and committed to doing his duty, he can't properly anticipate other people being treacherous and thus gets fooled and betrayed by basically everyone. Catelyn's defining trait, her desire to protect her family, leads her to make emotional choices that ultimately end up killing her husband and scattering her family. When characters aren't destroyed by their best qualities, they're torn apart time and time again by being forced to choose between two evils. \n\nAlso, this show gets its reputation for surprising deaths due to its reliance on the viewer's awareness of narrative tropes. In a typical show, the Good Guy investigating corruption and doing the right thing would end up saving the day, or the Good King fighting a war against an unjust king would win and set the realm right. By instead showing the realistic consequences of the protagonists' actions, the show counters those implicit beliefs about how fiction should work and ends up surprising people. \n\nFinally, I wouldn't hold Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones up as examples of the best TV has to offer. It's certainly exciting to watch, but TV as a medium is unique because it gives the viewers the chance to get immersed in a world over a long span of time and become attached to characters over years. A TV show that makes optimal use of the advantages of the medium should offer a fully realized world with rich characters, while still creating a technically competent piece. Shows such as The Wire and Mad Men fit this mold better than shows like Breaking Bad (which has a narrower focus, though is still very good) and Game of Thrones (which often suffers from inconsistent quality and awkward dialogue). That said, if the character map of Game of Thrones is too much for you, then these kinds of shows may just not be your kind of thing. There's nothing wrong with that, but you're missing out on a rich viewing experience not possible in any other medium. \n\nSecond Response: \nWhile I will agree with you that both shows have their weaknesses, i'm not convinced, based on you viewpoint's defense, that you are up to speed on what these shows are trying to accomplish. \n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you are reasonably young. For some reason, a lot of younger TV and Movie watchers are becoming obsessed with plot mechanics. I cannot for the life of me figure out why. 'If X is happening to my character, and character does y, and it makes no sense to me, my appreciation for the tv show has fallen.'\n\n This is not what pop fiction is about. \n\nBreaking bad was a character study of evolution and morality, a study of actions and consequences, and responsibility. Drawing connections to reality, and watching good people make bad choices is the overall point of the show. Yet you did not indicate that you even grasped the concept, instead just pointed out plot holes/character confusion.\n\nGame of thrones is even less plot centric. The plot isn't the focal piece (it's basically been done to death) it's the study of the characters/ ideologies. You reject their behaviors because they don't fit into what you consider correct behavior. Again, if you dislike the show for this reason, this defense is weak. Part of the strength of the show is learning and reflecting on why these people do the things they do, and why they act the way they act. You may not like the way they act. You may even say this makes the show 'less believable' at which point i tune you out (what part of anything on tv is even remotely believable).\n\nThe problem with movies like 'inception' (which i only moderately enjoyed) is that it makes a lot of people look at plot complexity and logic holes as the ultimate sign of 'story' quality, when there is no story in history that is regarded as classic or 'art' because of it's plot logic. It's the other stuff that you take with you that makes it longer lasting and enduring and elevates it to a new level.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction stem from the first response's effective engagement with the original poster's arguments and its more constructive, analytical tone. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response maintains a respectful and intellectual tone, inviting the original poster to reconsider their views without outright dismissal. It encourages further discussion, positioning the responder as thoughtful and considerate. In contrast, the second response is somewhat condescending, suggesting the original poster's youth and obsession with plot mechanics may cloud their judgment. This approach could alienate the original poster and create defensiveness, hindering a productive discussion.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first responder employs logical reasoning and references themes within the shows, offering a thorough exploration of character motivations and narrative techniques. This enhances their argument's persuasiveness, as it addresses the original poster's criticisms directly. Alternatively, the second response leans heavily on generalizations and personal feelings about viewing habits (i.e., associating youth with plot fixation) without sufficiently linking back to the specific points made in the original post.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response is well-structured with clear, articulated points that allow for easy comprehension and engagement. It effectively breaks down complex themes and provides examples, making it more relatable and digestible for the reader. The second response's style is less clear, with some convoluted phrasing and broad claims that may confuse or frustrate the original poster.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first responder seeks to reframe the original poster's perspective by questioning their interpretation and offering alternative viewpoints, creating a dialogue rather than a confrontation. The second response, while attempting to engage, does so in a more accusatory manner, which may provoke defensiveness rather than openness to change.\n\nOverall, the combination of a respectful tone, logical structure, and clear engagement with the original poster's arguments makes the first response more effective in potentially shifting their perspective on the quality of these shows.", "is_correct": true}

But there's lots of solutions that allow you to use mirrors to check instead, among them being\n\n- [adjusting your sideviews to incorporate the blind spot](http://www.caranddriver.com/features/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots)\n- [buying one of these](http://www.amazon.com/Fit-System-C0400-Passenger-Adjustable/dp/B001DKT0DO/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1436313257&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=blind+spot+mirror)\n\nBoth of these options let you keep at least your peripheral vision on the road and greatly reduces the time it takes you check your blind spot.\n\nEdit: Apparently, I've been doing it wrong the whole time. You guys are right, there shouldn't be any reason to take 2 seconds to do a shoulder check - I tend to scan the whole rear side of my car instead of looking at a specific spot. Thanks for the responses, I'm gonna go on youtube now and figure out how to drive more properly\n\nFirst Response: \nYou seem to be making checking the blind spot way harder on yourself than it has to be. It should be 1/4 second, turning your head at best 70 degrees and then glancing your eyes to the side. Most of the time, you know what's going on in your blind spot. The only time there should be any confusion is where bikers are allowed because they don't make noise, but typically you know if you have someone besides you on the highway. I'd suggest that you utilize slowing down and speeding up to accomplish what you want if you hate checking your blind spot so much or are scared that you sideswipe the car besides you either way. If you don't have a car directly in front of you, you can speed up 10-15 MPH (on a highway) and give yourself a comfortable lead so the car in you desired lane can see your turn signal and slow down for you. If you do have a car directly in front of you, you can plan ahead by putting your turn signal on immediately (so cars behind you can expect your next move) and then slow down at a constant rate of 10 or so MPH (again using highway speeds), let the car in your desired lane pass and then change lanes.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think you might be doing the blind spot check wrong. You aren't supposed to scan the whole area. There is one specific spot, maybe 6 inches in diameter on each side that you are supposed to look at. It's a very fast process. \n\nThe best way I can describe it is by relating it to video games. I don't know if you've ever played Counter-Strike, but there was a type of cheat called an aimbot. Whereas regular players would jump through a door and look around for players before starting to shoot, the aimbot already knew where the players were and automatically aimed the gun right at the other player's head. That's how you want your blind spot check to look. You look right at that one spot quickly and then go back to the road. You can take your time with it since you aren't wasting looks at places that are covered by your mirror.\n\nProper shoulder checks are irreplaceable. There is a very large blind spot in all cars, and many many accidents are caused by people not doing a proper shoulder check. My driver's ed instructor even made it a point that if we ever look at a mirror, we can't just move our eyes. We had to move our entire heads. It seemed stupid at the time, but I'm a much safer driver today because I made it a habit.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the second response's use of a relatable analogy (the aimbot from a video game) to clarify the concept of a blind spot check, making it more accessible and memorable. This rhetorical technique engages the original poster on a personal and emotional level, likely resonating more than the first response's straightforward advice. Additionally, the second response offers a clear explanation regarding the technique behind a shoulder check, reinforcing the importance of proper method over merely expressing alternatives to checking the blind spot.

{"index": 132, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: MRAs are right to claim that there are men's issues. However, the way they're trying to address them is ineffective and quite possibly makes things worse.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe fact that men are disadvantaged in child custody cases is appalling. So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the ACTUAL PERPETRATOR. That's disgusting, and obviously I could list many other real problems.\n\nBut the MRM is not the best solution to these problems, and often gives men's issues such bad press that it's toxic to defend them. In other words, it's not the MRM's fault that these problems exist, but it's actively damaging to the cause, quite possibly more than it has helped.\n\nDistancing itself from feminism breaks the gender equality world into \"men's activists\" and \"women's activists.\" This causes us to ignore that gender inequality is bad for everyone. No one wins when a man is arrested for being assaulted by a woman. This is not a victory for women's rights. Everyone loses, because a criminal walks free while an innocent person sits in jail. Sure, there are extremists who will claim to hate all men and think this is fine, but there are also crazy atheists who claim to hate all religious people. This isn't \"no true Scotsman,\" this is pointing out that it's unreasonable to define a group by its crazies, because if we did, no group would be reasonable. \n\nPitting MRAs against feminists undermines the notion of actual gender equality and makes it a \"men vs. women\" debate, which we all lose. \n\nIt would seem, to me, that a better strategy to promote men's issues would be to do it within the feminist movement. The feminist movement has existed for a long time and (relative to the MRM) is reasonably positively regarded. People get behind feminist issues. MRAs often complain that no feminists care about men's issues, but a) this doesn't seem to be entirely true unless we're yelling about strawmen and extremists and b) this would be even less true if people stopped leaving feminism/gender egalitarianism for the MRM. It looks like people are ditching feminism for the MRM and then complaining that feminists don't care about men's issues, which is only true because anyone who did left. Why can't we all just work together? I get that there are people who identify with all of the above, but it seems like EVERYONE who considers themselves ANY of the above should care about all of the above. I really can't think of an intellectually honest reason to care only about men's issues or women's issues. They're both real. So why are we treating them as opposing forces? It's not like we have to ban abortions because we start listening to male victims of violence. This isn't a zero sum game, why is it being treated as one? Everyone seems to think it is, and it just doesn't make sense to me.\n\nSome things I anticipate people saying:\n\n\"What about gender egalitarians?\"\n\nI think rebranding feminism as gender egalitarianism would probably be the best solution, but that's going to take a hell of a lot of time. One thing that would help is if feminists started acting like gender egalitarians and actually cared about all gender issues, and MRAs joining up with them would only speed up the process. As for people who consider themselves \"feminists and gender egalitarians,\" I see no issue. \"Feminist, MRA, and gender egalitarian\" is fine too, although I've never encountered one who phrased it like that. Those who consider themselves anti-feminists but gender egalitarians... Eh. I really don't know, but I feel like shitting on feminism in general is not helpful to the gender equality discussion. (this is as opposed to legitimate critiquing, which is fair game. I'm not saying anything anyone labelled \"feminist\" does is above reproach, nor anything the movement does. I'm saying condemning all of modern feminism and trying to start from scratch is really unhelpful, especially when a huge part of the world is still incredibly patriarchal; see countries where getting raped is still a crime--if you're female). \n\n\"Feminists aren't open to men's issues. I hear what you're saying, but that's not possible.\"\n\nBecome a feminist open to men's issues. You're listening to one right now. Make that two and we're one step closer.\n\n\"It's right for men's and women's issues to have different advocates because they are different. You might as well be saying that feminism should just merge with the LGBTQ rights movement.\"\n\nI don't think that's true. Men's and women's issues differ, but they are rooted in the same fundamental ideas. The reason men are arrested when they are the victim of domestic violence by women is that we live in a society that sees women differently from men. It's benevolently sexist to say that a woman simply couldn't hurt a man except in self-defense. It's also hostile sexist against men to say that men are simply violent people. Men's and women's issues are intrinsically linked, because stereotypes and perceptions of gender roles are the root of both. Essentially, I think men's and women's issues are symptoms of the same problem, so they can be addressed together.\n\n\"Is your problem with anti-feminists, or MRAs? You seem to move between the two.\"\n\nBoth, to some degree. I don't think it's fair to treat those two entirely separately, given the links. MRAs who are anti-feminist are the ones I disagree with most. People who identify as MRAs but also feminists I'm largely okay with, but the MRM in general is not terribly kind to feminists and borders on actively anti-feminist, which is the problem I'm talking about here.\n\nEdit: Guys, I want to have a conversation! I really am open to chatting about this and changing my view. I know lots of CMV users love the MRM, it gets brought up all the time... I want to understand your perspective. I don't bite.\n\nEdit2: Well, I asked and you delivered! Definitely an interesting conversation here. Credit to u/Prince_of_Savoy for highlighting issues with feminism that make it inherently poorly compatible with the MRM. I'll be checking back and responding to comments that might get added later tonight, but I may not get to all of them--sorry about that! I am reading and listening to all that is said, and I appreciate the many varied takes on the issue that have come up.\n\nEdit3: Okay, there are still new, good comments being posted, but there's also a fair bit of needless vitriol. I'm not responding to any comment that was rude, so if you came here to post that, you won't be hearing from me. Namecalling doesn't change views and just makes you look like a dick.\n\nFirst Response: \nYou seem to be coming from the premise that the anti-male parts of the feminist movement and the anti-feminist parts of the MRM are similarly extreme. I would disagree. Reading men's rights campaigners such as Ally Fogg (who I would highly recommend), I see a battle for one of the few campaigners whose motivation is to improve the lives of men, rather than as a reaction against feminism, to find a collective he can work with. He is forced to spend almost as much time fighting MRAs as anti-male feminists, simply because he recognises that the way to achieve his equality aims is not to blame everything on women. My contention is that until the MRM can move on from the reactionary core that defines so much of its work, and recognise the value of feminism and the equality of women (which includes accepting the ways in which women are still disadvantaged), the idea that feminism should accept MRAs and concede to their perspectives would be a betrayal of feminism's most fundamental principles. \n\nSo, in conclusion, I agree with your suggestion of collaboration in principle, but the reactionary and misogynistic principles that make up so much of the MRM make this impossible in the short term. \n\nSecond Response: \nYou act like MRA activists being pitted against feminism is entirely the fault of MRA's.\n\nThat's a bit simplistic I think. I certainly won't argue that it is just the fault of feminists either though.\n\nThe truth is, both MRAs and Feminists have extremely unhelpful extremist elements in their midst that frankly need to be denounced by the mainstream of both sides. Feminists love to complain about Misogyny in the MRM, but ignore any misandry among their own, or even claim that it doesn't exist.\n\nI'm not just talking about feminists who want all men to die (and those do exist). There are plenty of popular mainstream feminist with views that would be called sexist if the genders were reversed.\n\nLike Anita Sarkisian, who blames school shootings on \"toxic musculinity\", or claims video games make us sexist. She is not some extreme outlier or straw man. The fact that she raised hundreds of thousands on Kickstarter alone shows how mainstream her views are.\n\nThe fact is, whether you agree or disagree with the MRM or its methods, there is a reason it exists. In many cases these are former feminists who felt drowned out or ridiculed when they tried to talk about men's issues. Instead of denouncing them, feminists should take a good, hard look at themselves and really question why these people don't feel welcome in their community.\n\nAnd there are issues were feminist are not only not acting on men's issues, but actively oppose equality for men. (#notall ofc.) Feminists have for example pushed for lighter sentencing for women, when they are already hugely advantaged in that respect.\n\nMany feminist push for woman quotas in male-dominated fields, which many feel would mainly result in more discrimination against men then less against women.\n\nI'm sure others could list more examples.\n\nThe fact is, it simply isn't a coincidence that the movement is called FEMinism. And despite its grand claims, most members usually behave according to the name.\n\nFeminism (complete with Patriarchy theory etc.) just isn't the answer to create equality for all, or else either the MRM wouldn't exist, or there would be a womens movement on its opposite. So you really can't just \"rebrand\" it intro egalitariansim and ignore the underlying issues. A movement for true egalitarian values has to show these values in itself. And feminism, even mainstream feminism just doesn't in word or deed.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response is likely to have changed the original poster's view for several reasons:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response adopts a respectful tone while also providing constructive criticism of the original poster's perspective.

This positive engagement can foster an atmosphere conducive to open-mindedness and reconsideration of views.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The use of specific references, such as mentioning Ally Fogg as a representative of a more constructive MRA perspective, serves to provide concrete evidence supporting the argument. By discussing a credible figure within the MRA who promotes collaboration rather than reaction against feminism, the first response substantiates its claims and challenges the original poster's assumptions effectively.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response is well-structured, easy to follow, and contrasts the ideas presented in the original post with those of the MRM thoughtfully. The clarity of its argument helps maintain the reader's engagement and makes it easier for the original poster to digest the points being made.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: By starting with a focus on the original poster's premises, the first response actively engages with their viewpoint, rather than just attacking it. This method encourages the original poster to consider the feedback rather than becoming defensive.\n\nIn contrast, the second response mainly highlights problems with the feminist movement and tends to generalize the failings of feminism while reiterating grievances felt by MRAs.

This is exactly why I think he's the right choice.\n\nFirst, I think it means you get less backlash against the movement in general. If she were to interrupt another candidate, more people would use that as evidence against the BlackLivesMatter movement in general. That means more people would use the incident to negatively paint the entire BLM movement since they are less familiar with it, while the Sanders supporters who would be upset would be the least likely to do this.\n\nSecond, it forces Bernie to make a bigger deal out of racial injustice in his campaign. Even if he doesn't support the people who interrupt him, he has to at least issue some statement that says \"Why'd you pick on me? Here's everything I'm doing to help . . .\" and suddenly, it's a major part of his campaign.\n\nSanders *does* have a solid [page on racial injustice](https://berniesanders.com/issues/racial-justice) on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions.

In response to that he gave a massive speech with SCLC about racial inequality, hired outspoken BLM supporter Symone Sanders to be his national press secretary, and truly made combating racial injustice a cornerstone of his campaign. \n\nDid you not hear or read the SCLC speech? I'm sure Marissa and Mara didn't. Here's a link to it https://berniesanders.com/remarks-senator-sanders-southern-christian-leadership-conference/\n\nImportant to note that speech was given before O'Malley posted his policy positions on racial issues. Bernie actually reacted faster. \n\nThe interruption on Saturday did absolutely nothing to make Sanders more focused on racial issues. He had already hired Symone, she had already written her speech to introduce him Saturday night and speak out about how we need to end institutionalized racism in the country. The page on racial issues had already been written. \n\nEssentially, BLM asked Bernie to change in July, and by all appearances he has embraced the BLM message and changed in all the ways they asked of him. The \"protest\" yesterday did absolutely nothing to help their cause because they've already won Bernie over and he's already clearly the biggest supporter of the movement of all current candidates. All they accomplished was making themselves look bad. When you ask someone to change and they do it, you don't slap them and yell in their face about some of the changes being marginally slower than you would've liked. \n\nSecond Response: \nThe entire point of civil disobedience is to make uncomfortable or make inconvenient what is beloved by the mainstream. These things could be beloved things like first night in Boston for example, sit-ins, blocking off ramps. I can get behind shutting that down to raise awareness (I can't recall for certain if that was directly tied to #BlackLivesMatter, but it was certainly tied to the momentum begun under the Ferguson protests.) By interrupting the speech they were acting in that vein. By demanding four and a half minutes of silence they were acting in that vein. Even by making the statements about Seattle is a racist city they were acting in that vein (In response to the \"Let Bernie Speak\" chants). Where I think they made a miscalculation was in refusing to give back the mic. I suspect they refused to do that because people in the rally were no respecting the moment of silence (which was pretty tactless on the people crying \"Let Bernie Speak\").  \n\nIf the objective was about exposing the hypocrisy of white progressive liberals, how does forcing him to leave, then give a scripted response, and making Sanders out to be another unappreciated advocate accomplish that objective? Sanders respected their actions by standing to the side, letting them speak and not speaking during the moment of silence. I don't mention that to make Sanders out to be some saint, only to outline a rationale for what could have happened had they given back the mic. I don't think its unreasonable he would have told the crowd that they shouldn't have spoken during the moment of silence, then speak on the topics, if only briefly, that #BlackLivesMatter want to have, and then resumed to the itinerary of the rally. But even a brief detour like that would have been a massive statement: #BlackLivesMatter has a primacy in this political cycle over other political issues, they can dictate the conversation if they so choose, and force others to recognize the issues at hand, which *is the entire point of the hashtag*. Instead, they created another martyr of under-appreciated advocacy. It was a miscalculation. \n\nMoreover, the fallout is reminiscent of the fall of the Puerta del Sol and OWS protests. Both fizzled out because they became about purity, infighting and diversifying of objectives unrelated to the root cause of the protest. #BlackLivesMatter advocates are already concerned about other groups trying to hijack the hashtag for their subgoals. I was at the end of the Puerta del Sol protests, and believe me, it can get all over the place politically very quickly and that is a fast way for a movement to die out. I am not saying that there isn't a hypocrisy and blind spot in the mentality and thought of white progressive liberals, but not acknowledging how purity and infighting brought down other recent social media driven protests, advocates like these two are making a big mistake. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe prediction is based on the following key factors:\n\n1. **Engagement with Original Poster**: The second response actively engages with the original post's ideas about civil disobedience, addressing the implications of the BLM protest and the motivations behind it.

To preface this, I am *not* against anyone in the LGBT community and welcome the idea of gay marriage and things similar. However, I've never really been on-board with all these new genders. \n\nAnyway, some of the terms that come to mind are *Agender* and *Androgynous*. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words? *Genderfluid* and *Bigender* seem completely redundant too - so, why even have them? I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth. \n\nDoes it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as *gender-fluid* because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than *cross-dressing*. Again, I have nothing against that, but it seems like people are trying to make other words to someone glorify what they're doing.\n\nAlso, what's the deal with \"cis\"?\n\n* Cis-female.\n* Cis-male.\n* Cis-man.\n* Cis-woman.\n* Cisgender.\n\nIf the definition of \"cis\" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they *just* be called women and men? Why do they have to have a special name? Considering that people are giving away names to things that already exist, it seems really indicative of how strong other words in their dictionary are (see: gender-fluid and bi-gender redundancy).\n\nAgain, I can't stress this enough, I have no issues with people being who they want to be and how they want to be that. It just seems overly unnecessary to have a million new Facebook gender options for things that clearly overlap each-other. A lot of this also seems more of a ploy for attention, not someone *actually* identifying as something.\n\nWith that being said, am I just seeing this the wrong way? I get incredibly annoyed when someone tells me they're \"gender-fluid\" or \"cis-female\".

You can be annoyed about it, but \"cis\" definitely has a meaning.\n\nDepending on context, its probably safe to assume that when someone says \"woman\" what they mean is \"cis-woman\", but that doesn't mean there is no ambiguity.\n\nSecond Response: \nWhat a load of crap and a waste of time and energy. \nThere should be 3 options - Male,  Female, Other.\nWhy do these people want to be so precious and special?\nIt doesn't matter what you think other people think of you, what matters is your knowledge and appreciation of your own value.\nStop trying to impress everyone with your precise identity definitions and overly descriptive sex and gender orientations.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that leads to this prediction is the tone and emotional approach of each response.

{"index": 136, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: 'Mouse and keyboard' is the superior control scheme for PC gaming.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI am strictly a PC gamer. I own an XBox controller for my PC and am very interested in the upcoming Steam controller. But I'm hesitant to make the purchase, as I barely use my XBox controller. I have tried several times to get used to playing with a controller - even reinstalling old games and starting with the controller to familiarize myself - and I always go back to 'mouse and keyboard'. Below are the reasons I think 'mouse and keyboard' is the best way to play PC games (really: any game, but K&amp;M is really only an option on the PC).\n\n* The mouse is infinitely more precise than a controller. I can't even imagine playing FPS games with a controller (mostly, I've been playing 3rd-person action games a la *Arkham* and *Tomb Raider*). I know many FPS games use an aim assist system to compensate for the imprecision of a controller. I would rather have a more precise input system than an 'assist' to compensate for the imprecision of my input device.\n\n* Because we use them all the time, a keyboard is intuitive. Most of us use computer keyboards and mice on a daily basis in our work. Every QWERTY keyboard has the same layout. When a game tells me 'press X', I know exactly where X is. Even people who are very familiar with controller layouts haven't spent nearly as much time with that controller as they have with a keyboard and mouse. \n\n* Keyboard and mouse work for *all* games. As I mentioned, I prefer the precision of K&amp;M for FPS games. But I'm also a big-time RTS and strategy gamer (*Total War* are my favorite games) and there's no way I could imagine playing strategy games with a controller. K&amp;M works for everything. I even preferred *Dark Souls* with a K&amp;M - a game that many will say is only playable with a controller. \n\n* I am perfectly comfortable in my computer chair. One of the big advantages I often hear about controllers is the ability to play from the couch. I prefer to be close to my display (I play on a 32in TV and sit about 3 feet back). My keyboard and mouse sit on a laptop desk and my computer chair is very comfortable. I feel more engaged in my games at the distance I sit vs. sitting on the couch. \n\nWhy I want my view changed:\n\n* I think the Steam controller looks really cool, but I'm not sure I'd use it. I don't want to make a purchase I won't use.\n\n* Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer? \n\n* I've got a device I barely use. I would like to use it more, if there are games in which using it would give me a better experience. \n\nEdit: many good suggestions in this thread so far. I'm going to spend a few minutes playing some of the types of games mentioned (stealth, action, driving, etc.) and see if the controller enhances the experience.\n\nEdit 2: Hey everyone. Thanks so much for the discussion. Lots of good points made, but I think the best was made by /u/stoopydumbut, who suggested that using a controller adds an additional level of challenge. Props, also, to all the users who pointed out the genres of games (racing, fighting, flight sims) that I don't play, but benefit from a controller. I am going to make it point to use my controller as often as I can going forward, and am still considering a Steam controller purchase. Thanks, everyone, this was exactly the conversation I wanted to have. Please feel free to keep posting, if you have something new to add. I will keep reading, commenting, and awarding deltas. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

If you've ever played GTA or a similar game with a controller, then switched to mouse and keyboard, you probably threw your mouse through your computer in a fit of rage. If you want more use out of your controller, get GTA V and drive around a lot.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; Am I missing out on good experiences that only a controller can offer?\n\nYeah, you're missing out on the subtle immersion that the vibrations from a controller can generate. I played an action game (probably Tomb Raider) a little while ago, and when an explosion took place off-screen, or sometimes during a cut scene, the controller would vibrate. Coupled with the sound design it really added to the feeling of being \"inside\" the game.\n\nEdit: You mentioned the Batman games. It's been a while since I played them, but I think the controller vibrated a little during a silent takedown, mimicking the thug's struggling. It was cool. It's hard to explain the value of the sensation in its absence, but it did add some extra enjoyment to the game.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses to the original post regarding the superiority of 'mouse and keyboard' for PC gaming, we can observe several key stylistic elements that differentiate the two:\n\n### First Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The tone is somewhat confrontational and dismissive, suggesting that the original poster's views are incorrect without much depth in which to substantiate that claim. It assumes a shared frustration with driving controls on mouse and keyboard.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques**: The sarcasm of throwing the mouse in rage adds an element of exaggeration, which could potentially alienate the original poster. The response lacks personal anecdotes or wider context to support its claims, making it seem less convincing. \n- **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The structure is straightforward but lacks nuance, making the message feel abrupt. It consists of shorter sentences and a limited explanation. This may detract from its overall effectiveness.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster**: There is little direct engagement with the original poster's perspective or a call to action beyond suggesting a specific game. It feels more like a rebuttal than a dialogue.\n\n### Second Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The tone is more inviting and informative, aiming to engage the original poster by addressing their question directly. It presents a more balanced view, acknowledging the original poster's experiences while introducing the value of a controller in a specific context.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques**: This response incorporates personal experience, which provides a relatable context for the reader. The use of specific examples (like vibrations during gameplay) adds depth and illustrates the argument effectively.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The sentences are varied in length and structure, making the response more engaging and easier to follow. The flow contributes to the overall readability, enhancing the persuasive quality of the argument.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster**: This response addresses the original poster's question directly and elaborates on the immersive experience a controller can provide, offering insight into how controllers can enhance certain types of games.\n\n### Prediction:\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Key Factors Leading to Prediction:\nThe second response effectively engages with the original poster\u2019s curiosity and concerns while also providing personal insights and specific examples that illustrate the benefits of using a controller. This method not only validates the original poster\u2019s experiences but also opens the door for further exploration of controller use, aligning with the intent of changemyview discussions.

My problem is that everyone seems to agree that self harm is bad, but no one can give me a logical argument for why.\n\nSo far this is the logic I've heard again and again:\nSelf harm is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could die, or could get an infection.\n\nThe problem I have seen with this is that you can replace \"self harm\" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.\n\nLacrosse is bad because it is dangerous. It is dangerous because you could get a concussion.\n\nCooking is bad because it is dangerous. You could get burned.\n\nTaking Lithium for Bipolar Disorder is bad because it is dangerous.  It is dangerous because it could give you kidney failure.\n\nSo I can not accept the false-logic of dangerous = bad. That means anything dangerous is inherently bad, and that is not true.\n\nIt is very easy to self harm without any danger.  Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.\n\nOf course this can still leave permanent scars, but so can getting a tattoo or a piercing, so once again, self harm isn't inherently bad just because it leaves scars.  Lots of things leave scars, so scars aren't what's bad about it.\n\nOkay, but it's a symptom of a bigger problem.  Yes.  And the bigger problem is the thing that should be fixed.  But that *still* doesn't mean that the symptom is bad.\n\nIf you have a bacterial infection, you treat the infection.  You don't just cover any redness up with makeup to treat the symptom.  So self harm, the symptom of many mood disorders, isn't what should be treated.\n\nSo besides the ridiculously flawed \"it's dangerous\" argument, explain to me why self harm is inherently bad.\n\nTl;Dr, something being dangerous doesn't make it bad. Give me a real reason why self harm is bad.\n\n**EDIT**  I have to go to bed now, but I will continue this conversation with anyone who posts new comments in the morning.

Sterilize tools, clean and cover wounds, etcetera.\n\nThis may be true today, but for our entire evolutionary history this was absolutely false. Any and all wounds carried *significant* risk, so we have, as a species and in general, developed an instinctual response to avoid them.\n\nIf someone demonstrates that they *lack* that preventitive instinct by cutting themselves there's an immediate cause for moral concern because so much of our socially acceptable behaviour (ie: morality) is tied up in biological instincts: the rational desire to live, empathy, and so on.\n\nSelf-harming, even if it effects no one else, *does* call into question someone's mental state and fitness to act in a pro-social way, so I think it's fine for us to want to discourage that kind of behaviour and label it 'bad'.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;The problem I have seen with this is that you can replace \"self harm\" with so many other things and still follow the same basic structure.\n&gt;Lacrosse is bad because it is dangerous.

In all these situations, the activity is done where a risk of harm is present, but the practitioners try to avoid harm.\n\n\nSelf harm is more like an addiction, such as drug abuse or alcohol abuse. Where it is done as a coping mechanism to cover deeper rooted problems within a person, and can quickly become addictive to the point where a person cannot stop themselves from doing in.\n\n\nEven then, the pain and damage caused by drugs is an unintended consequence. The comedown, the shakes, the liver damage, the collapsed veins and ruined skin.  No body takes methamphetamines because they want to damage their body with them\n\n\nSelf harm is literally your damaging your body, for the sake of damaging your body.

It does not dismiss the original poster's argument but offers a substantial counterpoint that addresses the psychological and societal implications of self-harm. This tone can resonate more deeply with someone contemplating the moral implications of their views.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first responder employs a logical progression that ties self-harm to biological instincts and social norms.

With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.

This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.\n\nFor example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were \"just following orders,\" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.\n\nPoverty can make good people do evil things. \n\nDrugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.\n\n---\n\nLet me explain what I understand by \"good people\" and \"evil things.\" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?\n\nA \"good person\" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the \"outside force\" is religion.\n\nAn \"evil thing\" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. \n\nIn order to CMV, please:\n\n* convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.\n* show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.\n* show me that my definitions of \"good person\" or \"evil thing\" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).\n* anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

When do you define a person by their actions whether they're good and when do you define them by their ideology?\n\nIndoctrination happens in mostly religious households and scenarios. Yes, political as well, but when it comes to beliefs and values I think religion does the indoctrination part a bit more. Especially with the whole \"hell if you don't believe\" idea.\n\nI think that someone isn't a good person if they have an ideology I disagree with. I think nationalists are bad, fascists are bad and so on. So when it comes to ideology, they're not good people doing bad things, they're bad people doing bad things.\n\n&gt;show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.\n\nI mean it's all about interpretation.\n\n\"Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.\"\n\nHe's certainly right when saying with or without religion, good people would do good things and bad people would do evil things.\n\nSome actions aren't evil, yet aren't good either. So maybe good people could do bad things yet not evil.\n\nTheft is an obvious example. It's not a good thing surely, and good people could do this whether or not they were religious, for different reasons. But it's hardly *evil*. Sometimes, theft is necessary or them to survive.\n\nCan't really think of anything else to add here.\n\n&gt;show me that my definitions of \"good person\" or \"evil thing\" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).\n\nI suppose I already said what I thought on here.\n\n&gt;anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.\n\nI agree that drugs is a problem. But then you could have the philosophical discussion like... Are they really themselves when influenced by drugs?\n\nReligious people aren't drunk or intoxicated when doing things, they're fully aware.\n\nSecond Response: \nThis is my first time encountering this quote, but tis is my interpretation:\nThis quote could be held as true only under the premise that \"religion\" in this case does not refer exclusively to theistic religions. Any system of rituals or beliefs that people follow, including the patriotic following of orders you referred to, is a religion in this context.\n\nAs for your other examples, they might be countered in a small variety of ways, depending on the interpreter's beliefs, including something like the following:\n-Actions taken by a person in poverty in order to survive are not evil because the person has no alternative\n-People who are drugged are not themselves, in that they are controlled by the effects of the substance or addiction thereto.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Both responses attempt to address the original poster's (OP) viewpoint on Steven Weinberg's quote regarding religion's role in moral behavior.

It presents a counterargument that frames ideological indoctrination very much in terms of religion, which could reinforce the OP\u2019s initial resistance to the quote.\n- **Second Response**: Uses reasoned arguments to draw parallels between religion and other systems of belief, emphasizing that the original quote could potentially encompass more than just traditional religious contexts.

The Platinum rule gets around this, but there are more than a few problems with it.\n\n1. Uncertainty.  It is often hard to know what others want.  It's a nice idea to treat others they want to be treated, but in practice that's hard to do.\n\n2. What a person wants may require you doing an immoral act.  If a heroin addict wants you to give them heroin, does that mean it is moral to do so?\n\n3. Conflict.  Often the wants of one person may be in conflict with another.  A person may not want to be put in prison, but if they are killing people, it is moral to put them there for the protection of others. How does this help you decide between mutually oppositional desires?\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nThese are good rules of thumb for \"civil behaviour\" i.e. an etiquette, a how-to-act when in society, but they are not at the core or morality. How we treat each others is a secondary concern/consequence - how we treat ourselves is primary - it has existential primacy, which means it is more fundamental. (This primacy of how we treat ourselves is implied by the gold and silver rules, but not the platinum). \n\nThe core of morality is that the individual has the capacity to choose, and all choices have different consequences that one choice is better and of greater value than another. To deliberately choose a greater value over the lesser is the core of morality, and to choose the bad over the good is the core of immorality.\n\nThe Gold and Silver rules are only as good as this more fundamental aspect of morality, how you treat yourself. Even Robinson Crusoe, alone on an island, has choices to make that make him either a virtuous man who works hard and struggles to do the right things to survive, or an immoral man who ignores his circumstances and chooses to laze on the beach wishing vainly for the coconuts to fall.\n\nThere are thousands of virtues (and vices) that have nothing to do with others, but that require a sustained effort of moral/righteous choices to attain *such as*: self-honesty, integrity, clarity of mind, industry, productiveness, rationality, creativity, focus/concentration, imagination, pride, courage, determination, knowing when to reward/punish yourself, knowing when to push on or rest etc etc!\n\nThe Golden and Silver rules are only as useful to society as the virtues you have yourself!

It directly labels the Golden Rule as \"obviously deeply flawed,\" which can come off as dismissive. The use of phrases like \"hard to know what others want\" and scenarios like offering heroin to an addict introduces a stark and somewhat alarming emotional response.\n- The **Second Response**, in contrast, is more reflective and philosophical. It does not overtly criticize the Golden Rule but rather places it in a context of broader moral considerations.

These people rely on heard immunity to protect themselves from the diseases that vaccinations are supposed to prevent. If more people who can get vaccinated don't, it puts those who can't get vaccinated at a greater risk to develop some of the issues that vaccines can prevent.

Humans have gone from the invention of writing to the capability to destroy our entire species in just 5,000 years. On a cosmic timescale, that is an instant. Will the Earth still be inhabitable for us in our current states by the time another instant passes? Luckily, we\u2019ve already started primitively engineering and augmenting ourselves, with genetic modification, prosthetic legs, hearts, ears, etc. The technological advances in just the last 100 years (as well as the damage we\u2019ve done to our planet) has been incredible\u2014 what will the next 5,000 bring?\n\nLet\u2019s assume for the sake of argument that the nearest sentient species developed on a planet 100 lightyears away. (Just FYI, a quick Google/Wolfram Alpha search tells me the fastest human spacecraft now being designed will go 200km/s, which means it would traverse 100ly in 150,000 years.) Let\u2019s say that, just by chance, this alien civilization achieved our current level of technology very near to us in time\u2014 only 10 million years ago. Do you think it's likely that if they existed today they would have organic bodies? Even an alien species so incredibly close to us on a cosmic timescale is almost unthinkably distant in the context of our lifespans as individuals and as a civilization. And organic life forms are just not well-suited for interstellar travel.\n\nEssentially, I think organic life is a means to bootstrap into existence truly immortal technological \u2018life\u2019. This is true on Earth and on every other planet as well. And just by the nature of cosmic timescales, it\u2019s much more likely to come into contact with the next evolutionary stage of an alien species than to be lucky enough to catch it in the minuscule period while it\u2019s still fully organic.

Keep gaining complexity and redundancy to account for failed individual units and complexes of units, and you start to get something that looks more and more like a biosphere instead of just a bunch of robots milling around. \n\n\n\nPresumably, we're most likely to encounter an ecosystem capable of propagating itself or its signals through light years of space- it may not be possible to tell if that system's been designed by previous members of the ecosystem or if it emerged spontaneously as on Earth. \n\nSecond Response: \nI think robotics (AI and prosthetics) are just a middle step for us and won't last, therefore we are more likely to meet advanced organic life. As someone else said, a more advanced robot will become more and more like an organic life form as it increases in complexity and redundancy; it would be easier to just start with organic life. Currently it is easier to build a prosthetic arm but in the future, when medical science advances, we would rather grow our arm back and grow it stronger. \n\n Considering long space journeys, a very advanced organic life would be at an advantage over a robotic life form. Organisms have the unique ability to self repair on the micro scale, something I don't think robots will be able to achieve with the same efficiency. Robots could develop some kind of nanites but they would be separate parts needed to repair damage while in organic life every single part of the body is used to make repairs. An advanced robot would need a power source and replacement parts to survive while organisms need only food/water. On a long journey, a robot colony could run out of parts. They could do some limited recycling but only organic life can achieve a perfect recycling system. A perfect system in which waste is consumed again after some re-energizing process fueled by the ship. Advanced Organic life is more likely to survive a space journey\n\nEdit: I should have clarified that I know food is energy but it is easy to grow and doubles as the physical material of our bodies as well while robots would need separate things. I'm assuming that a ship capable of interstellar travel would have a lot of power to supply to its inhabitants so maybe to robots just need a way of storing power within themselves between charges.  \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Both the first and second responses to the original post share a significant amount of similarity in content, but they diverge in their style, emotional approach, and argumentation techniques.\n\n### Stylistic Elements Comparison:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - **First Response**: The tone is more inquisitive and analytical. It directly questions the lifespan of sentient robots, indicating a curiosity and skepticism towards the original poster\u2019s assertions about robotic longevity. This tone encourages a factual discussion rather than an emotional one.\n   - **Second Response**: This response adopts a more assertive tone.

It also reflects a hint of optimism about organic life being the superior form, which may resonate more emotionally with readers.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**:\n   - **First Response**: It uses a Socratic method, posing questions and presenting ideas rather than making definitive statements. This technique encourages engagement and further debate.\n   - **Second Response**: It employs a more argumentative style, providing direct counterpoints to the original argument and stating claims of superiority for organic life forms. It offers examples (like self-repair capabilities) to strengthen its position.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**:\n   - **First Response**: The sentences are relatively straightforward and structured in a way that promotes clarity.

{"index": 142, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: For the west to enjoy the lifestyle it does, subjugation of third world countries is necessary.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe goods and services we consume are made possible by the abundance of cheap resources and labour that the west gets out of underdeveloped countries. The West has no reason to aid or allow the development of these poorer countries, since that would disrupt the ability to acquire cheap resources, thus diminishing the economic superiority of the west. All in all, people in the west's lives can only be \"good\" because people's lives in poor nations are \"bad\". With the current infrastructure on earth, it is only possible to make the west happy, not everyone. \n\nFirst Response: \nCountries go through a development life cycle. Initially, they are under-developed and poor, with low wages. However, those low wages are a competitive advantage, as goods can be produced cheaply there. So multinational companies move their factories there. That abundance of new jobs, even if they're poorly paying from an international frame of reference, are better paying that what the people use to do. Then secondary industries pop up. Restaurants that cater to the factory works, for example. Some of those restaurants succeed, some fail. Those who own the ones that succeed, make money. Also, people who succeed in the factory become managers. They send their kids to get better a education than they received, and thus they get a better skill set. That better skill set from a more educated populace leads to more skilled labor. More skilled labor leads to better paying jobs, as now companies that require skilled labor will look to the country, because even skilled labor will be cheaper there then elsewhere. Eventually, skilled labor becomes the comparitive advantage for the country, and some other underdeveloped country becomes the low skill, low wage location.\n\nThis is how the world works man. It's what's happening in China, as suddenly Chinese wages are higher than say, Vietnamese wages. This keeps on happen as countries develop.\n\nTechnology plays a major role in how quickly this happens. It's also about to flip the whole thing on it's head, as automation starts to reach new heights. Soon, labor won't be anywhere close to the requirement it once was to create finished goods, and capital investment (into machines) will become much, much more important. This leads to jobs, (although less than there were originally) returning to capital and infrastructure abundant countries, like the US.\n\nSecond Response: \nI had a really long counterargument, but I lost it all.  So I'll spare you and give you the short version.\n\nIt's kind of counter-intuitive to view things like the low cost of exported resources or the low cost of wages as being exploitative of developing countries.  Those are economic advantages for those countries and allow them to compete globally, even when they may have poor infrastructure, dysfunctional governments, etc.  And, ideally, they disappear slowly as a country develops, giving it time to adjust and plan for the future as it's economic situation changes.  \n\nIt's also important to understand that low wages don't mean cheap manufacturing.  Currency exchange really comes into play here.  China is a good example.  For a few years a while back, it was artificially deflating its currency to make it more attractive to offshoring.  The stronger the renminbi was relative to the dollar, the less cost effective it was to move manufacturing there.  After they ended that practice, you saw companies like Motorola even move manufacturing back to the US, because high tech, low labor factories in the US were nearly as cost effective as low tech, labor intensive factories in China.  The Moto X was reported to have cost only an additional $4 a unit to be manufactured in the US.\n\nOn the flip side, rising costs from developing nations does not make Western lifestyles unsustainable.  As those countries get wealthier, their middle class grows.  A growing middle class means more people who buy Western goods. Have you ever wondered why GM kept Buick around after it's bankruptcy?  It sits awkwardly between Chevrolet and Cadillac.  A fully optioned Chevy will often cost as much as a comparable but less featured Buick and a fully optioned Buick starts getting close to Cadillac pricing territory.  Buick is incredibly popular in China.  GM will slap a Buick badge on a crappy, cheap car from Korea and it will outsell anything they offer in the US.  So margins may get thinner, because resources and manufacturing get more expensive, but overall revenue increases because the market grows larger.  \n\nThat's not to say that it would be sustainable for *every* country to be on the same economic level as the US.  I don't know how well that would work.  But a Western lifestyle would not be harmed much by bringing the world up to, say, the middle class standards of China.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** employs a factual and somewhat technical tone, emphasizing economic development through a global lens.

I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to.

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nThere are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?\n\nAlso let's say a couple has joint finances and are both working. Should the spouse pursuing the divorce not be entitled to his or her share of the money in the finances?\n\nAdditionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way.\n\nUltimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty. Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children. But your solution doesn't solve this problem, someone caught in a relationship with an abusive or cheating spouse will have no recourse regarding custody of kids or financial compensation and therefore will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce.\n\nSecond Response: \nOkay, first, you are buying into the stereotypical myth that one \"loses everything\" in a divorce. This isn't true. What happens is that the assets that were jointly acquired are divided between the two parties. A lot of people are unhappy at having to share with someone they're not having that loving feeling towards. Understandable. But the other person isn't taking everything from them. Yes, there are some acrimonious divorces where there's a bitter battle down to who gets the last fork, but that is the fault of both parties involved more often than not, because they're usually both acting like bitter babies out of hurt and anger and not handling things with any sort of reason or accord. \n\nAlso, you seem to think there's only 1 or 2 reasons for marriages to end. There's MANY. Falling out of love is but one. There's also emotional abuse, physical abuse, cheating, neglect, etc etc etc. If you've invested yourself, not just financially but emotionally as well, and put your everything into it, do you really think the other person should be able to just take whatever they want and walk away?\n\nI like that in some countries you have to be separated for a length of time before you're allowed to divorce, because that time can allow for cooler heads to prevail and things can end without all the fighting. That's not to say it's easy, in the majority of cases, there's going to be some pain involved. But when you can step back and catch your breath, it's easier. \n\nNow on to the alimony bit, which is what you seem to be confused about. A few facts you seem to be unaware of: First, alimony is NOT automatic. It has to be requested, and then a judge will look at the situation and history of both parties and make a decision from there as to whether or not alimony will be granted and how much. There's about a dozen and a half factors that go into deciding alimony amounts. And there IS a reason for alimony. It is NOT a punishment. It is their to help compensate for unfair economic effects of a divorce. If one spouse sacrificed their career in order to support the other while they pursued their own, or pursued their education, that spouse is put at a distinct disadvantage by a divorce. Alimony levels the playing field a bit. If there's no prenup or other such agreement already in place, the court looks at many factors, like the length of the marriage, the ability of each spouse to earn income, the phsyical, financial, and emotional states of each party, and so many more. Then the amount and length of time the alimony will be paid is decided. \n\nAlso, you seem unaware that marriage is legal contract as well as an emotional commitment. When one party breaks that contract, there's legal ramifications. You cannot make legally binding commitments and just walk away from them...and if you have any integrity at all, you don't make any sort of commitment or promise and then just walk away without expecting to make some recompense. \n\nAnd no one is kept in a marriage by these threats you speak of. If they stay because they're afraid of divorce, that's their own choice and they're making themselves miserable. The courts will divide the assets, not the spouses, and there will be some losses for both sides. That's how life works. When you build something together with another person, you don't get to just take all the marbles and leave when you decide you don't want to play any more. You BOTH contributed, and you BOTH stand to lose some of what you built. \n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Engagement with the Original Poster:** The second response actively engages with the original poster by addressing their misconceptions about divorce and its legalities. It counters the notion that divorce \"punishes\" one spouse by explaining the purpose of alimony and the division of assets. This direct engagement likely makes the poster consider the issues in a deeper way, as they are offered factual clarifications rather than just opinions.\n\n2. **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The second response adopts a somewhat confrontational tone when it describes the original poster's perceptions as \"stereotypical myths\" and calls out the emotional responses to divorce as \"acting like bitter babies.\" This emotional charge may provoke a more significant reflection from the original poster on their stance, inviting them to reassess their views on the topic.\n\n3. **Rhetorical Techniques:** The second response uses rhetorical questions and concrete examples to challenge the assumptions made by the original poster. By drawing on the complexities of divorce and emphasizing the reasons for various outcomes, it presents a well-rounded argument that encompasses emotional, financial, and legal perspectives. This multifaceted approach is likely to encourage the original poster to open their mind to the nuances of the debate.\n\nIn contrast, the first response provides valid points but tends to be more neutral and less engaging, which may not resonate as strongly with the original poster. Thus, the second response is more persuasive in addressing potential biases and assumptions, leading to the prediction that it effectively changed the original poster\u2019s view.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 146, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Shampoo and special body wash products are unnecessary.\n\nOriginal Post: \nBar soap is all you need.\n\nAnd you dont wash your hair at all, you just rinse it. \n\nSometimes I use shampoo, maybe once in a month or two, if I did something specially dirty or got chemicals in my hair etc. But your hair is healthier without it, and if I cared enough to find an alternative I would use something natural.\n\nIf you quit using shampoo, your hair might be greasy for the first couple days, but with nothing but proper rinsing your hair will be able to clean itself.\n\nFace wash is unnecessary as well. Bar soap is fine. Special body washes are unnecessary. It is all a marketing ploy.\n\nI am a clean and beautiful boy who has no problem attracting the opposite sex, and have never been led to suspect that my habits are somehow smelly or unclean.\n\nWhat is the point of using these products? Please, Reddit, change my view: hygene products are a scam.\n\nFirst Response: \n***Warning:*** This is not a typical CMV answer, nor a typical approach towards answering one.\n\nFirst let me state that I have been employed as a natural/organic body care specialist for many years, and have some intensive educational background in the field.  I'm also a straight male that specializes with male issues in the industry, and I have been suggested by dermatologists for those looking for a natural solution to their specific issues.  While I do work with women (not enough men for stable work), I am proud of my ability to help men (who come to me with little or no understanding of how it all works) get better, healthier skin and hair that they can be comfortable with. \n\nBecause it always needs to be said: Nothing stated here constitutes medical advice for a medical condition.  If you have concerns, please consult a medical professional.\n\nEnough of the jibber-jabber...\n\n&gt; Bar soap is all you need.\n\nTechnically, yes.  That is a cleansing agent.  It will clean you.\n\nSpecifically, no.  Different cleansers will effect different skins in different ways.  Using one that is \"right\" for you will make a MASSIVE difference.\n\nRegarding soaps:  Differing skin types (oily, dry, acne prone, patchy, etc.) have different needs.  One of the larger factors to consider is the skins pH level - those that run more alkaline (oily, flawless skin) need to have soaps that are non-abrasive.  Bar soaps are usually more alkaline than liquid cleansers, but are not usually alkaline enough for most people.  This caused bar soaps to strip away the skins natural oils and jack the skin up by overly drying it, leading to acne and blemish spots over time.  Those with acne and patchy dry skin typically want face wash that contains sulfur or salicylic acid (reduces redness from acne), as it helps reduce oil production and keeps the size of pores down.  Those with dry skin without acne want something that keeps the moisture up (cream-based foaming cleansers work best) but is able to be effective against clogged pores.\n\nThat's just for the face.\n\nIf you want to get into the myriad of different hair types and the benefits of using product designed for those types, I could.  There are tons of things that can make a huge impact, especially for those with medium to longer hairstyles.\n\nBy the things you are saying - \"will anything clean me better than a bar of soap?\"  No, not really - it won't make you less or more clean by using something else.  It will, however, be a massive benefit to those who need the benefit of using matched products.\n\nThe best example I can give you it that you claim bar soap works just fine.  With bar soaps, there is so much difference in terms of moisture control and pH that I can find something at Target that will make your face look like shit and I can also find something that will make your face feel like a velvet couch at Target.\n\nThe difference between common, conventional brands is massive.  Dove is geared to be almost pH neutral, where as Irish Spring isn't.  Not that I personally endorse either product (I don't).\n\nYes, there are people that have minimal effects from using specific products (usually oily skin with VERY tight pore structure), and their skin is capable of working with most everything.  Perhaps you are just one of those people.\n\nMy 20 year high school reunion is this year, and I am frequently assumed to be in my mid-to-late 20's, not 38.  I'm not baby-faced, I have skin that I take care of in a way that is beneficial to it.  My morning and evening routine takes 15 seconds, as I rarely apply cleansers to my face - just oil, specifically certified organic argan oil. That's about it for my needs, but others need to spend 5-10 minutes every day to get their skin to the point where they are happy with it.\n\nIt really is trail and error:  We gotta play around as see what works, but I can usually get it right within two shots. \n\n***Some things I can guess at based on your statements:***\n\nYour hair is fine, thinner individual thickness than the average person.  It has a natural oil towards it, but not overly so. Your hair follicle distribution is probably on the thinner side naturally, not from hair loss (think \"less dense than an afro\").   Your scalp is also slightly oily, but not overly so.  If your hair is longer than 5 inches (almost a guaranteed no here), you probably have some breakage and split ends that you need haircuts every month or so to remove.  You may have a diet that is processing B vitamins (niacin, B-5, and B-12) in a higher concentration than normal and you probably are consuming solid amounts of calcium and/or silica if you are not having breakage with longer hair.\n\nIf you have long hair and white pillow cases, they will show a serious difference in coloration due to the oil being consistently applied to them.  That is assuming that you wash your pillow case once a week or less.\n\nYour nails might be showing straight lines from the bed to the tip.\nAlso, your nail beds probably are damaged, and the skin around the nails are not the same level of moisture as compared to the rest of your hands.  The skin around the sides and bottom probably crack or peel back frequently.  Ask a woman if you have no idea what I am talking about what I say \"nail beds\".  \n\nAlso, obviously, I am assuming that you are a man.\n\nYour skin is probably naturally soft, rather than leathery.  It is most likely drier than it should be, but since you rarely wash your face (if at all), you have not stripped what little natural oil is able to get to the skins surface - and it appears to be good.  You most likely have some blackheads, although they are probably quite small, and you have more of them than is considered normal in certain spots (nose, upper cheek, etc.).  If you rub your hand on your forehead, it probably releases dirt on contact (in little lines).  It also, if rubbed hard and for 5 seconds, will probably become flaky and irritated (red for longer than 20 seconds).\n\nAlso: Hair doesn't clean itself.  Nothing does.  Rinsing helps remove dirt and grime if you have naturally smooth hair.  I am guessing that you have smooth hair, without kinks.  If you don't use a cleanser, you probably are benefiting from your hairs naturally slightly oily state (which is uncommon for most people).  I actually encourage people to wash their hair 2 times a week, and to condition it 3 times a week (on average).  You don't want to strip the oils by using a cleanser, and if you do, you should always use a conditioner to replace the oils you removed.\n\nAlso, while you might be doing well with the ladies - it's not your current hygiene routine that is doing it. I would guess that you are naturally a decent guy with a positive attitude, above average intelligence and solid looks. That can overcome some things like smelly hair and a few small blackheads that you don't notice but the ladies do.\n\nHowever, you could also be rich.\n\nAnyways, the point of these products - most people need them to feel like they look their best. However, everyone can benefit from using specialized products, even those that are blessed with minimum-maintenance skin and hair. \n\n***Going out on a limb here and guessing your sex, age, nationality, other fun shit to guess at:***\n\nYou are a male, 16-29 (specifically 18-23), most likely Caucasian (possibly Latin or Native American, and higher chances that you are Asian), straight to wavy hair, probably with some serious Mediterranean/Balkan/Eastern European or Asian genes in the family (mostly on your mothers side if most of these guesses are right). You have dark hair, possibly black but most likely brown.  You eat very little garlic, unless served hot like soups.  You probably consume more that 2 ounces of cheese or dairy a day, or consume calcium in decent amounts - this only applies if you are over 24 years old, if not, than you may not be consuming any calcium. You have long eyelashes but not as many as everyone else, and possibly very few on your bottom eyelids.  You don't see a lot of sun compared to others your age.  You most likely work indoors and you don't have a manual labor job like construction.\n\nJust some guesses.  Who the fuck knows.\n\nSecond Response: \nI have a beard. If I get food in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been working on a car or something and get oil in my beard shampoo is very much needed. If I have been doing a bunch of fry cooking and have splashed cooking oil onto my beard shampoo is very much needed. \n\nSo no, just rinsing is not always sufficient. \n\nBar soap is horrid for my beard. It makes it dry and brittle as well as itchy. \n\nIt is true that daily use of shampoo is not good for hair, and that for many unless they are involved in messy activies do not actually need to shampoo more than once a week one. That truth however does not support your claim that it is wholly unnecessary. All that it takes is one instance that it is necessary to prove you wrong and I listed several. \n\nThe point of using a body wash is to apply a scent to your body that is lighter than cologne or perfume. The purpose of shampoo is to strip your hair of oils and dirt. They are not a scam, they do what they are intended to do. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - The **First Response** adopts a more formal and authoritative tone.

On top of that, those with a college degree have higher average wages and lower unemployment rates than those without one, so it is still a worthwhile investment to take out loans to go to school.\n\nAside from that, there are plenty of jobs out there that don't require a college degree, so if parents can't afford to pay for school for their children and their children don't want to take out huge loans then there are other options available.\n\nSecond Response: \nThere are plenty of jobs that don't require college, and the number is actually growing.

{"index": 148, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:If Women have the right to be Pro-Choice then Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood.\n\nOriginal Post: \nHello CMV!\n\nFirst of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.\nI believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.\n\nI understand that the state assumes the right of the child &gt; the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.\n\nOr on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.\nObviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.\n\nTL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.\n\nEDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice\", however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.\nEDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood\". \nTheScamr worded this nicely:\n&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.\n\nEDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

It sucks that men can knock up women and then have no say in the matter over whether a child is born or not, and have to pay to support their unwanted children based on the mothers' wishes. It's not fair that women get to deal with pregnancy and men don't. It's not fair that men are able to physically remove themselves from a pregnancy situation and ditch the woman to deal with it however she can best. It's REALLY not fair to grow up with one of your parents never acknoledging you exist, leaving you at a disadvantage assuming the mother isn't either wealthy or lucky enough to have a very good support network/social safety nets to rely on. It's not fair that this argument comes up as a comparison to women being allowed to control what they do with their reproductive system, as though that's the same as a man controlling his wallet.\n\nThis is adulthood. Being a responsible adult means a few different things for biological men. Sucks, but there it is.\n\nSecond Response: \nAbortion prevents a child from being born at all. It's essentially another birth control option. You as a man also have many birth control options. (There will soon be an injection you can get in your junk that functions as a permanent contraceptive until you reverse it, cool right?) Birth control options vary because men and women have different equipment, so nothing we can do about that. \n\nAbortions in particular can be medically dangerous or cause permanent infertility, so they are really the worst kind of last-ditch option, even if you're totally comfortable with the moral aspect of it. In a lot of places they aren't even legal, and in places where they are, there are all kinds of people trying to make them illegal. If you're a woman who gets an abortion (if you're lucky enough to be in a place where it's legal and accessible) you'd better not talk about it because people will judge you for it and you could lose friends or jobs. It's not a fucking easy thing, an abortion. Read some confessions about it some time. \n\nOnce we get past all the various clever ways we have to prevent pregnancy from coming to term, a child is born. It's the miracle of life.\n\nNow there is a living being just sitting there, crying and shitting itself, and who is going to take care of it? Can we just let it die? Current ethics would say no.

It totally sucks to feel like your body is completely wrong for you. If we could cure them with therapy or drugs, most of them would be happy to be cured of it. \n\nBut we don't understand neuroscience well enough to develop a cure yet. Counselling does very little to make them feel better. So instead, we use surgery and hormone replacement therapy. It's not ideal, but it makes them feel a lot better. Unlike people with untreated anorexia, bulimia, and other serious mental disorders, they go on to live happy and productive lives. Since it works, why argue with it?\n\nAs for body integrity identity disorder (alien hand syndrome,) there isn't really enough scientific consensus to support a particular treatment. Amputation is permanent, and there is a risk that the patient will develop phantom limb syndrome, or another psychological fixation in it's place. Hopefully, doctors will develop a working cure for these patients in the near future too. But right now, it seems like psychological therapy is the best option.\n\nSecond Response: \nThis is a very common topic on [this sub] (https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3an3j3/cmv_i_believe_transgenderism_is_a_mental_illness/cse5qgp), so I'm just going to copy older responses to save time:  \n\n&gt;I don't really have a biological understanding of the modern interpretation of gender and have developed this view purely out deductive reasoning  \n\nHere is an excerpt from a [textbook on neuro-biology explaining the modern scientific understanding of sex, gender, and gender identity](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10943/):  \n\n&gt;&gt;Gender refers more broadly to an individual's subjective perception of their sex and their sexual orientation, and is therefore harder to define than genotypic or phenotypic sex. Generally speaking, gender identity entails self-appraisal according to the traits most often associated with one sex or the other (called gender traits), and these can be influenced to some degree by cultural norms. Sexual orientation also entails self-appraisal in the context of culture. For purposes of understanding the neurobiology of sex, it is helpful to think of genotypic sex as largely immutable, phenotypic sex as modifiable (by developmental processes, hormone treatment, and/or surgery), and gender as a more complex construct that is determined culturally as well as biologically.  \n\n# \n\n&gt;We, as a society, have decided that these are sick individuals who need medical and psychiatric attention. Certainly, an individual with alien hand syndrome could have a procedure to remove their hand in a safe and controlled environment and continue living a suitable life. We don't allow that, though. How is having gender identity issues different from afflictions I have described above?  \n\n[Gender dysphoria is already classified as a mental illness under the DSM V.](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) \n\n&gt;Also, why are these individuals allowed to make unnecessary changes to their body when we don't provide the same liberties to others?  \n\nBecause it works. [Here is a comment with multiple citations](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2o02ul/cmv_i_think_transgenderism_is_a_mental_health/cmih4oh) that show current medical understanding of trans issues and the treatment options, especially showing how transition is effective. It also addresses your \"alien hand syndrome\" comment and why treating that isn't comparable to transgenderism.  \n\nI'm reproducing the relevant parts below:  \n\n&gt;&gt;Two, trans feelings simply don't respond to psychiatric medication designed to 'cure' them. No professional organization in the world - even those that do classify us as a mental illness for (I feel) mostly historical reasons - recommends just giving us SSRIs or the like and sending us away. Traditional therapies simply do not work.\n\n&gt;&gt;Compare this with a disorder that could be seen as an analog to trans people: Body Dysmorphic Disorder. BDD sufferers fixate on a small (e.g., a mole) or nonexistent part of their bodies, which they believe makes them hideous and unlovable. Some seek out treatment to remove the offending part. But BDD, unlike trans people, [responds well](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1785390/) to both [therapy and SSRIs.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3589080/)  \n\n&gt;&gt;Three, trans people show absolutely enormous improvement when allowed to pursue our identifications unimpaired. [One study](http://www.gires.org.uk/assets/Medpro-Assets/trans_mh_study.pdf) found that 70% said they were happier having transitioned, as opposed to 2% who did not; 63% had thought about or attempted suicide more before transitioning than after (only 3% said they thought about it more after). [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12363/abstract) found that on a test designed to measure distress, \"significant decreases were found in the subscales such as anxiety, depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and hostility.\" [Another](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12155/abstract) found that the relief was so profound as to be measurable directly through stress hormone levels in the blood. [Yet another](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937168) found decreases in anxiety from 61% to 33% and in depression from 31% to 8% pre- to post-transition. So your notion that regrets are common is simply unfounded and in fact the exact opposite of the truth.  \n\n&gt;&gt;This is not the case for (for instance) BDD sufferers - see the links above. If the offending part is removed or modified (e.g., dermatological treatments to get rid of a mole), they simply re-fixate on a new part. Trans people, in general, do not.\n\nThe linked comment addresses everything you've asked. You can also go to /r/asktransgender to talk to actual trans people.

Because it's a made up thing, but you're told you can't act a certain way, or wear certain things etc etc etc. \n\nA white person doesn't experience lifelong racial oppression in America. They never have. They may feel very close to black culture, but when it comes down to it, society doesn't oppress them for their perceived race. Society won't see them as something different to *white* if they like *black* music, or clothes, or culture. \n\nIf someone likes something other than what their expected gender norms are then they are put outside of those norms. And seen as, and treated as, different. This isn't the case with race.\n\nSo to be trans is one thing.

{"index": 152, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:It is morally unjustified for me to eat lamb meat\n\nOriginal Post: \nI really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty!\n\nLet's start with why I find eating meat at all to be morally justifiable. I only buy meat from free-roam organic farms, which are clearly labeled here in Denmark. If I eat one of the cows I see on the outskirts of my city, happily roaming and eating grass, I don't really feel guilty. They get to experience a reasonably long, happy and healthy life. We also have pigs that are allowed to roam free in the forest. We give them a safe environment, and their lives end up on average longer and happier than they would be in the wild.\n\nSo imagine if an alien species came to earth and says: *\"Hey, we'll create a post-scarcity society for you. All your life you will be in perfect health. You (as in all humans) will never want for anything, you will get all your favorite food and you get to play video games all day or whatever it is you want to do. But when you reach the age of 50, we will kill you in a humane way and then we will eat your corpse.\"* I would find that to be a good deal. It would remove world hunger, there is no need to fight for resources. No diseases killing young people, no genetic defects. Not even having to work or do anything you don't want. And you would still get a reasonably long life to enjoy.\n\nAnd now we get to lamb meat. These guys are killed at 1 month to 1 year, which is in the best case less then 1/10th of their lives. They don't get to enjoy their lives. In my alien analogy, it would be like making the deal \"Yeah some of you get to live until 50, but some of you we will take and eat at 5\", which suddenly becomes less acceptable.\n\n**What would change my view:**\n\n* Somehow making my alien analogy work for eating humans at 5\n\n* Giving me another compelling moral argument for why eating lamb meat is ok.\n\n**What will NOT change my view:**\n\n* The \"Animals are made for human consumption so they don't matter\" argument. Well yes, but they are also intelligent agents capable of feeling pain and suffering. An alien species with superior technology and intelligence could decide that \"Humans are made for alien consumption\", and enslave our species, keeping us in cages all our lives. That would be horrible. So even if they are less intelligent and feel suffering differently, it does not give us the right to harm them for no good reason. We as a species get to decide which animals are for human consumption and which aren't, and what conditions we keep them in.\n\n* The \"we evolved to eat meat\" argument. Yes, and we can eat chicken, pork and beef. No need to eat lamb even if a vegetarian diet was insufficient. \n\nSorry for the long post. I realize it may be a bit tricky, but I really really want my guilt-free lamb roast. So there you have it, my first ever CMV :)\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the replies! So this has been addressed from 2 perspectives, that got me to change my view:\n\n1. If we go with the alien analogy, if they were to take some human cells and clone some humans on their home world, let them play happily on a field until they are 5, and then slaughter them for food, how immoral would that really be? The children would accept it as the status-quo and enjoy their lives, as they are too young to understand all the ramifications. No parents would have to part from their children, thus causing more suffering. \n\n2. On the other side, it has been shown that other animals are slaughtered at an even younger age, so my view is inconsistent. Pigs, who are a lot more intelligent than lambs, usually get killed at 5 months. Milk cows are parted from their young as soon as they are born, and the calves get killed quite often only after a few weeks.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For one thing, I wouldn't take the deal and neither would most people.  There is an awful lot that we'd be missing out on - and there is an awful lot that these animals are missing out on.  They do not self-actualize (to whatever extent an animal can ever be said to self-actualize).  And they ain't living to 50.  Lambs may be killed at age 5 instead of age 12 (as /u/Vorpal_Kitten pointed out), but 12 is still a terrible deal.\n\nThe reason free range meat is ok (if it's indeed ok) is not that we're giving these animals a good deal.  It's that we're treating them humanely.  We aren't chaining them to their stall.  We aren't hurting them.  They live a life free of misery.  The idea isn't \"hey you'd really rather us eat you than not\", it's \"we aren't torturing you\".  \n\nWhen you consider which of these justifications better shows our morality, consider the question of fertilized eggs.  Are they basically fine (even many vegetarians would be ok) since they clearly had no chance to suffer?  Or are they the worst of all (most vegetarians consider it worse than veal) because they literally had no chance to experience anything?  I'd argue the former and not the latter.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; [cows] get to experience a reasonably long life\n\nHave you looked into the age cows are slaughtered by the company you get your meat from? Cows can live twenty years (compared to human 80) - odds are who you're buying from is *somewhat* better than UK McDonalds, whose official rule is \"The age requirement for beef animals entering McDonald's supply chain is a minimum of eight months\" but most beef comes from cows under three years old. Looking to your alien example, all the beef people eat is from the equivalent of 5 to 12 year olds. If meat producers weren't being technical with their definitions, the vast majority of beef would really be called veal.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response successfully changed the original poster's view because it engages thoughtfully with the original poster\u2019s arguments while maintaining a respectful and nuanced approach. \n\nKey Factors:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response presents a calm and reflective tone. By explicitly stating that the alien analogy is problematic and questioning the feasibility of the deal proposed, it helps ground the discussion on moral standards that resonate more deeply. It communicates empathy and a willingness to understand the poster's viewpoint but challenges it constructively.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response employs contrasting scenarios (the deal with the alien and the perspective on lambs' living conditions) to emphasize the inconsistency in the original poster's justification for eating lambs. This approach encourages the original poster to reconsider their position by presenting an alternative viewpoint without dismissing their feelings.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response is structured in a way that flows logically from one point to another, making it easy for the original poster to follow the argument. The use of examples, such as fertilized eggs, adds clarity without introducing overwhelming complexity.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first responder references specific points made by the original poster, such as the alien analogy and the morality of free-range farming, demonstrating careful listening and engagement.

These are largely unrelated topics, yet at least 80% of the time people hold these 'suites' of ideas.\n\nPeople seldom shift on these big issues, because views aren't evidence based, they're ideological. The few times people do change its because of one of two reasons.\n\nAn overall change in societal norms on the issue. Same sex marriage is a good example of this. This wasn't even on the agenda 20 years ago. There has been little 'data' to change peoples minds; we've just had a kind of cultural shift, and now its broadly accepted. It wasn't data or evidence that changed people's minds, it was a change in societies norms.\n\nThe other thing which I believe *can* change folks' minds is personal experience/change. I've known people to retire, or have  a health crisis, which shakes up their whole outlook, including views on ''the big issues. Or perhaps a personal brush with an issue-\"My son came out, now I'm pro-same sex marriage\"\n\nSo persuade me people are actually rational, and can be convinced by actual facts-CMV\n\n[EDIT]:  To clarify I mean objective evidence(data, stats, facts), as opposed to emotive appeal(personal anecdotes/experience.  I'm sure there's some grey area, but that's the general idea)\n\n[\"evidence\" in this context means objective stats or data, and doesn't include personal experience, or one emotionally affecting news event(e.g \"Sandy Hook really got to me, now I'm anti-guns\") ]\n\nFirst Response: \nThis varies a lot based on what type of issue you are talking about.\n\nI'm surprised you used climate change to support your view - to me climate change is a clear example of evidence *clearly* driving people's views.  The climate change \"debate\" is politicians arguing over science, but the issue itself is a matter of scientists, and among credible scientists there isn't really a \"debate\" because the evidence all points solidly in one direction.  The arguments against climate change come largely from corporate interests and the politicians and \"scientists\" bought by corporate interests.  In other words, the scientific community largely agrees (based on the evidence) that climate change is a major challenge, and some politicians (who are not experts in climate science) have accused the entire scientific community of pulling some sort of scheme.  One side is motivated by desire to uncover the truth through experimentation and research (scientists) and the other is motivated by money from sponsors (politicians).  \n\n\nSecond Response: \nAre your set of \"big issues\" specifically \"issues that are controversial/unresolved in 2015\", and your set of evidence specifically \"evidence that is available in 2015\"?  Because if so, you might imagine that the reason the issue is unresolved is because the fact pattern can be interpreted at least two ways.\n\nHow about some previous large issues?  \n\n*Evolution  (evidence resolved via science)\n\n*Empiricism vs innate knowledge (evidence resolved via science)\n\n*Heliocentric astronomy (evidence resolved via science)\n\n*Prohibition (evidence resolved via a grand societal experiment)\n\nI would disagree with your characterization of same sex marriage attitudes.  What happened was that the gay community made a conscious effort to encourage one another to \"come out\".  People suddenly had many more data points, and were thus able to generalize from something approximating [actual set of gay people] instead of from the very-skewed sample they'd previously known about.  They hadn't previously known that gay people were so normal because the normal gay people were mostly closeted.\n\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to my prediction is the directness of the argument in the First Response, which leverages a clear emotional tone and strong rhetorical techniques to counter the original post's stance.

I argued that while I understand their frustration, I still hold its unacceptable to break the law the way BLM did. \n\nMy friend argued back that since both of us are white, we can never understand the situation and the anger these representatives of BLM feel. Therefore, she argued, we cannot criticize their actions since we cannot and can never understand their perspective.\n\nMy friend showed me [this article](http://time.com/3605606/ferguson-in-defense-of-rioting/) in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion,\n\n&gt;Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America.\n\nIn response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound.\n\nI'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America\n\nSo please, CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But then you are in the game of choosing for protesters whose causes are worthy of civil disobedience and whose are not.  Safe to say the protesters themselves always feel their particular cause is worthy.\n\nBut that's not really the issue here.  Look at your headline.  You just assume to the people reading it that \"we\" means \"white people\" and \"their\" means minorities.  In fact, when I first read your headline I couldn't understand who thought white people couldn't be criticized.  Reread your sentence.  If you're not making major assumptions about race, it really reads like \"their\" are referring to the subject of your first sentence.\n\nSo I guess my question to you, if your racial blinders on so strong you can't even craft a headline without revealing a very narrow, very white view of things.  If you can be this oblivious in this one case, how are you sure any of your assessments regarding race are unbiased?\n\nIf you are a rational person, your own post should cause you to have serious skepticism towards any view you have regarding race, or as you might thing of it, how \"we\" deal with \"them\".\n\nSecond Response: \nIs it your view that white people can criticize minorities without reservation?\n\nI think it's also worth acknowledging that the context and audience of your criticism. If you're talking to a bunch of white people, it's worth recognizing that you all have hard to overcome biases and misconceptions about what it's like to be a minority. If you're talking to a group of black people as a white person, it's worth keeping in mind that your ethos may not be very strong. (and if you're talking to rando's on the internet both of those things may be true!)\n\nSo it may be incorrect so say as an absolute that white people can't criticize minorities, but I'd also say that it's very difficult to effectively and empathetically do so.\n\nYou might also want to consider that making moral judgements of *people* is a lot more complicated problematic than making moral judgments of *actions*. Is interrupting rude? Of course it is. But have you never done something rude? How do we begin to qualify your relative shitttyness to the BLM girl's shittyness, based on the severity and amount of rude things you two have done in your lives, in order to give your the moral high ground to criticize her character? (Assuming you think you need the moral high ground of course, but at the very least you'll agree that many people think that's an important thing.)\n\nIt's way easier to say \"it's rude to interrupt,\" and be done with it.

{"index": 155, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Coffee is overrated, the effects received are negligible and often a placebo, and people who say they like the taste are lying to themselves.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.\n\nEvery child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.\n\nI consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.\n\nThe extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.\n\nIt seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nCould that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?\nChange my view.\n\n\n\n_____\n\nFirst Response: \nOn top of what's already been said, the reason why 'espresso connoisseurs' hate Starbucks is because they burn their beans (over-roast them) which produces a strong bitter taste, and then they overload it with sugar to mask the bitter taste. This is fine if you don't like the taste of espresso\n\nStarbucks is like it's own subdivision of espresso centered a bit more around the sugar. And that's fine, and clearly tons of people enjoy it enough to make it the large enterprise it is. But the people who've had and loved actual espresso, and learned to enjoy the taste of it, will be shocked upon trying Starbucks to find that the espresso part of the drink tastes like shit, and there's way too much sugar. It'd be like enjoying fine local craft beers all your life, then being thrown a Bud Lite. Sure, Bud Lite is popular, but it doesn't have what someone who enjoys craft beer is looking for. Or lets say you grew up having fresh, delicious hamburgers from the cows on your farm along with fries from potatoes you grew at home, then you had a McDonalds Big Mac. Shit, I love myself the occasional McDonalds, but it scratches an entirely different itch than homemade hamburgers and fries.\n\nI know I'm sounding pretentious. I really have no problem with Starbucks. Just trying to explain.\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \n[The effects of caffeine on the human body are very well documented](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=effects+of+caffeine&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eThWVe7kO_X8sASBu4CQCg&amp;ved=0CBwQgQMwAA) and to describe it as a placebo is just plain wrong.  While coffee is not the only way to get caffeine, the majority of people who drink coffee are doing so mostly for the caffeine.  If you don't need the caffeine in your daily routine, then this would make sense as a reason that you do not need to drink coffee.  I would also like to point out that different people have different sensitivities to the drug, so you might be tolerant enough to the extent that you don't feel any obvious effects after a single cup.  As caffeine tends to be subtle, this is highly likely (especially if you have already been getting the proper amount of sleep).\n\nAs far as taste goes, it is an acquired taste.  I am a fan of things that taste bitter in general, so coffee is not that big of a jump for me, but most people do not like bitter flavors as much as so coffee may be a bit too strong of a flavor for them.  There is also the fact that the majority of the easy to access coffee doesn't actually taste very good.  The main objective of most coffee is to get caffeine into the body, and so it sacrifices taste to make it easier to brew in large amounts.  the instant coffee that you reference being familiar with is one of the worst offenders in this area.  It is specifically designed to be easy to prep so someone who is not fully awake early in the morning can get their coffee going without much hassle.  That easy of use naturally sacrifices it being optimized for taste.\n\n&gt;It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nStarbucks actually doesn't have very good straight coffee.  Their plain coffee tends to be burnt and generally over cooked.  However, most of their products sell not based on their coffee, but on the sugar and cream that they add to most drinks.  As such, it is a great place to get coffee if you don't like the taste of coffee and want to hide it with other flavors so you can still get the caffeine, but as far as people who like plain coffee, it is not very good.\n\nIf you ever want to try what is generally considered the best coffee in the world, find a good Turkish restaurant and order a Turkish coffee.  It is very bitter, so if you are not a fan of bitter you will not like it, but everyone who likes coffee likes Turkish coffee (as a side note, Turkey is one of the first cultures to regularly drink coffee, so they have some of the oldest traditions and recipes associated with coffee).  If you are a fan of alcohol at all, you can try an Irish coffee.  It is like a normal coffee, but instead of adding milk, Irish cream or whiskey is added (often served with a bit of whipped cream on top).  It is one of my favorite alcoholic mixed drinks.\n\n&gt;Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee?\n\nI think so.  It is a drink with about 500 years of history behind it, and in that time some people have made it exceptionally good.  However, as teh majority of coffee is served not for taste but for the caffeine, it is likely that you haven't had any super high quality coffee before.  The is also the possibility that you are just not a fan of bitter tastes in general, in which case coffee may never appeal to you.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** This response employs a conversational yet slightly confrontational tone, using analogies that might be interpreted as elitist, comparing Starbucks to low-quality beer and fast food, which can come off as dismissive to the original poster's experiences.

Given the possibility that God actually does exist and assuming an infinite gain or loss associated with belief or unbelief in said God (as represented by an eternity in heaven or hell), a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.). Pascal formulated the wager within a Christian framework. \n\nI am addressing the counter-arguments of \"Nature as not a proof of the existence of God\" and \"Argument from inauthentic belief\", which you should read about if you would like to talk to me about those.\n\nSince I'm not great at reported speech, I will quote the thoughts of my imaginary atheist:\n\n&gt;I am an atheist. I believe there is no deity or higher power which governs nature.\n\n&gt;As such, I am most probably damned by a great number of religions.\n\n&gt;If I love my child, and if wish it well, I must do everything in my power to secure that.\n\n&gt;One of those things is instilling faith into my child. \n\n&gt;I should feign faith, as hard as I can, to make my child a believer, and a practicing one, at best.\n\n&gt;That way, their faith will be sincere and strong, even if mine is not, saving them, and MAYBE EVEN me in the process.\n\nI only see as conflicting the \"Argument from inconsistent revelations\",\n&gt;Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the wager, in an argument known as the argument from inconsistent revelations. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in \"the wrong god\", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager.\n\ne but even so, instilling ANY faith could still be better than NO faith, more because a number of deities value believers more than non-believers.\n\nAs such, Change My View, from the standpoint that there is multiple religions, and, for the sake of argument, from the standpoint that there is only one religion in the world (imagine a planet of only Christians and atheists, or Jews and atheists, etc.)\n\ntl;dr - I should teach my kid to believe in God and be a good human being, and not just the latter.\n\nEDIT: I understand rule B and that is why I have given two options.\n____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Unfortunately, in your chance for infinite gain, you're also risking angering another god and therefore a chance that is probably just as likely for infinite loss.  \n\nSecond Response: \nThe weakness of Pascal's Wager (whether or not you're betting on your own behalf) is that all of its unlikely-but-infinite payoffs have the same expected value - a 10^-10 probability of the Judeo-Christian God existing, multiplied by the infinite benefit of believing in Him if He exists, has the same expected value as a 10^-1000 probability of My Buddy Bob being able to grant me eternal bliss multiplied by the benefit of said eternal bliss if I let him sleep with my wife.\n\nThe problem is even worse if we argue about different cardinalities of infinity.  If the Judeo-Christian God offers a countable infinity of blissful moments, but My Buddy Bob offers an *uncountable* infinity (let's say he proposes to stretch every moment in eternity into an eternity on its own), My Buddy Bob is strictly a better bet than the Judeo-Christian God by the same logic of Pascal's Wager.\n\nIn Pascal's Wager, the fact that we encounter infinite expected values isn't a sign that belief is strictly better than non-belief; instead, the mess of contradictions these infinities lead to is a sign that *this is the wrong way to think about the problem*.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Both responses approach the original post's argument surrounding Pascal's Wager with analytical criticism.

{"index": 157, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Morality is objective\n\nOriginal Post: \nI was just reading [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/35y0qf/cmv_some_opinions_are_ethically_right_and_can/) where everyone keep saying that morality is subjective. \n\nI honestly think that it's not, morality is objective, everyone knows at any time what would be the most morally correct thing to do, and that the problem is doing it instead, since actually doing it would come with a price that you may not be prepared to pay, therefore saying that the moral thing to do is the opposite.\n\nYou might say that in the past century the moral compass has changed and yadda yadda, and we all know that it is simply not true. Morality never changed a bit.\n\nWhat people are willing to do for morality has changed.\n\nI expect some answers to clarify the concept of \"moral\", and I think it can be stated as \"the most moral action is the one that causes the least possible amount of grief\".\n\nFirst Response: \nI'm not sure if this is against the rules but I'm going to say that both viewpoints are correct...from a subjective (lol) viewpoint. All people in the world clearly do not agree on a moral standard in all areas. Never have, never will. What is generally accepted to be right and wrong changes. Slavery for millennia was commonplace and not seen as wrong. Heck, Africans sold their own people into slavery. So in both of these senses, morality can be seen as subjective. \n\n\nYet despite the opinions of the past, slavery is wrong. This is a fact. Mental gymnastics and culture was what tricked people into thinking it was OK. So in that sense there is an objective morality. Just because people don't agree or change opinions doesn't mean that truth does not exist. \n\n\nBut then on the subjective side, there are very hard moral choices sometimes. Use a classic example, killing Hitler before he became a dictator. Is it wrong because it's murder or right because it saves lives? I'm such a case and in less extreme cases, there may not be an answer and it is up to the individual to decide their course of action, in other words, it is subjective. This may not make sense at first, but consider another dilemma. You have extra money to spend and can't decide whether you want to donate it to charity or buy your girlfriend a present. Is there really a wrong answer here? Would it be morally wrong to spend the money on yourself even? No. Therefore not all choices are as black and white as right and wrong. Even in the Hitler example, there is no wrong choice because we simply don't have enough information. Would killing him cause an alternate future that is  even worse? Would killing him solve every modern problem we have? There is no way to know without being an advanced time traveler or God. Therefore it is subjective to the individual to choose what seems best to them. \n\n\nHowever, if you chose to kill or not kill because you wanted to mess things up as much as possible, that WOULD be wrong. Sometimes our attitude is more important than the action itself. However, if you are unaware at age 42 that drinking in driving is illegal and all around bad idea and you drive drunk and kill someone, you should not be exempt from responsibility simply because you are an idiot. So in that sense morality is objective. \n\n\nSo basically morality is complex, though it is spun to be more complex than it is, I agree with you. It is generally easy to determine whether something is right, wrong, or neutral. I have found many controversial topics to be controversial not for their complexity but because people are selfish and try to make it complex so they are justified. That said, some things truly are complex. \n\nSecond Response: \nA few problems with this:\n\n1: Your definition of morality isn't necessarily what is moral. I'm not sure if you've taken a philosophy class, but this is a common debate among philosophers. \"Causing the least amount of grief\" is utilitarian, which means that it tries to maximize  something generally perceived as good (I.e life, pleasure) or minimize something generally perceived as bad (suffering, death, or grief in this case). There are multiple schools of thought for and against this: for instance, deontology is the idea there are moral absolutes. For example, if you ask me where my family is so you can murder them, I am morally obligated to tell you where they are because lying on my part is inherently wrong. Some say that we have infinite obligation towards the \"other,\" or other people/ another person; so even if an action results in, say, extinction, if you ask me to do it for you I must do it, for you. Other commenters have already said that you can't calculate grief and pleasure, and some people react to things more or less than others. What this means is that, yes, your definition of utilitarian ideals is true, but in practice, it is not necessarily moral. \n\n2. Reality is subjective, which means everything, including morality, is also subjective. Subjective, according to my highly qualified Google search, is defined as \"based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions: dependent on the mind or on an individual's perception for its existence.\" Think about it: people's personal opinions, perceptions, experiences, et cetera, shape how they view the world and what they think of it. Thus, our differences in views mean our realities and ideas are also subjective, and all our man-made thoughts, like those on morality are also subjective, meaning morality cannot be objective.\n\nHope I was able to change your view.\n\nPhilosophical work on morality:\nImmanuel Kant, \"Critique of Pure Reason\"\nJohn Stuart Mill, \"Utilitarianism\"\nSoren Kierkegaard, \"Fear and Trembling\"\nEmmanuel Levinas, \"Totality and Infinity\"\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To compare the two responses and determine which one might have successfully changed the original poster's view on the objectivity of morality, let's analyze key elements:\n\n### 1. Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response:** This response carries a mixed tone, being somewhat humorous (\"from a subjective (lol) viewpoint\") at the beginning and then transitioning to a more serious exploration of morality. It balances intellectual engagement with a casual feel, aiming to relate to the OP\u2019s perspective while also introducing complexity to the discussion.\n- **Second Response:** The tone here is more formal and academic. It directly critiques the OP\u2019s definition of morality, presenting structured arguments. The use of phrases like \"I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve taken a philosophy class\" can come off as condescending, potentially alienating the original poster.\n\n### 2. Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response:** Uses anecdotes (like the Hitler example) and exaggeration (\"mental gymnastics\") to illustrate points, making the argument relatable. It acknowledges the complexity of morality and takes a balanced approach by stating the validity of different viewpoints.\n- **Second Response:** Relies heavily on philosophical frameworks, using technical terms (like utilitarianism and deontology). It also cites influential philosophers and their works, aiming for authority in the discussion. However, this technique may make the response feel less approachable.\n\n### 3. Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response:** Although lengthy, the response has varied sentence structures that keep the reader engaged. The use of conversational language enhances readability despite some complex ideas.\n- **Second Response:** This response is more dense, with longer sentences and complex vocabulary. The academic tone could make it harder for readers unfamiliar with philosophical terminology to engage fully with the argument being presented.\n\n### 4. Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response:** Engages with the OP by acknowledging their viewpoint, presenting a counterargument while validating some elements of the OP\u2019s perspective. This can create a sense of dialogue rather than confrontation.\n- **Second Response:** While it presents logical critiques, it does so more as a dismissal of the OP\u2019s stance, potentially closing off engagement. The structured critique without much validation of the OP\u2019s thoughts may make it feel more adversarial.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Key Factors\nThe first response is more likely to have changed the original poster's view because of its approachable tone, balanced engagement, and relatable examples. It acknowledges the complexity of morality and validates some of the OP's concerns while introducing the idea that morality can be subjective in certain contexts. This method builds a rapport with the OP, making it easier for them to consider differing perspectives. In contrast, the second response's formal and critical nature might lead to defensiveness rather than openness to change.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 158, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: America's economy is destined to fail\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'm young, so of course my biggest concern at the moment is the rising national debt, specifically student loans. College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. If I hadn't been able to get a 100k loan, I wouldn't be 100k in debt right now. I would've gone to a state school, and eventually appreciated that fact once I became more emotionally mature. Parents have a hard time letting their kid get a tattoo, but they let you get a HUGE loan on what is right now a big gamble? Please.\n\nNow, why is that relevant? Well, the economy IS doing well right now, but who exactly is in charge? A bunch of people who the future economy won't affect in the slightest. Since a large majority of millenials are bogged by debt, we can't afford to properly flourish the economy like we want to. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting to be more poor. Someone's going to get fucked.\n\nTechnology is rapidly advancing, and many of the low-income jobs new grads have been forced to take are about to become obsolete. As there is no general income implemented yet, a LOT of people are about to be broke. The only really essential jobs will be things automation can't accomplish, e.g. unpredictable jobs. Almost any job in existence will likely eventually be run by a machine, I can't think of one that can't, there are factories in Japan that do maintenance on themselves.\n\nAs an American, I don't know much about other nations, as school taught me exactly jack shit about them, but I have to wonder if they're in a similar boat. The model on which our economy is built rapidly becomes more out of date every minute. Eventually we WILL have to make changes, and I doubt those in power at the time will have the competence or open mindedness to do so.\n\nOf course, none of this mindset was helped by [this book](http://www.epi.org/publication/failure-by-design/).\n\nPlease, PLEASE someone change my view. I really don't want to live in this country if I'm destined to end up homeless after defaulting on my loans.\n\nAny ideas?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns?

Especially China.\n\nChina was closed off from the world economy and completely stagnant prior to the 1970s.  [Massive famines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward), [social unrest](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution), etc.  As China has entered the world economy, it has added a *huge* supply of labor.  That competition bids down the price that laborers can get in the western world including the USA.\n\nIt has also resulted in the largest reduction in human poverty ever.  So its probably a good thing overall.\n\nAs workers in China get richer, they'll start to be less competitive with US workers, and it is likely US workers will be able to get higher wages.\n\nAs to your specific student loan situation.  That's the result of a poor decision on your part combined with a poorly structured government program.  As time goes on, it is likely social norms about student debt will change, and this sort of thing become a bit less common, and also hopefully loan programs will be reformed.  Certainly you wouldn't let your kids get in the same kind of debt you did, for instance.\n\nSecond Response: \nThese are good points, and I'm happy to see someone chalk it up to actual reasons instead of just \"banks are evil\" for once.  That's a nice change around here.\n\nWhile these are problems, the economy is not destined to fail.  It's a living organism like anything else, and it will adapt to the changing time.  It's a self-correcting problem in many cases.  If there are only 3 rich people left, they can't get richer anymore because there isn't anyone left to give them money for anything.  It becomes in their best interest to keep money flowing through the economy.\n\nRegarding student loans, you've hit the nail on the head.  It's far too easy to get a loan these days, but what is the alternative?  If banks stop giving out loans for colleges, the new rally cry will be \"Banks are discriminating against poor people and making it so only rich people can go to college and better themselves.  The rich get richer!\"  And they'd be right.  \n\nThe root of this problem isn't that it's so easy to get a loan.  It's that everyone believes they need to go to college now.  People take out $100,000 in debt, without any idea what they're even going to spend it on, and then only later does it occur to them that they have to pay that back somehow.  And since we've got this mentality now that college is basically High School: Part 2, colleges can basically charge whatever they want, because we're all under the impression that if you don't go to college, you're basically fucked.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post regarding America's economy, we'll assess their stylistic elements and predict which of the two succeeded in changing the original poster's view.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach:\n- **First Response:** The tone is informative and somewhat detached, presenting factual references and emphasizing a positive change in the global economy due to China's integration into the world market. It has a mildly optimistic outlook, suggesting eventual improvements in wages and social norms related to student loans.\n- **Second Response:** This response carries a more conversational and empathetic tone, initially acknowledging the original poster's points and providing a bit of reassurance. The phrase \"I'm happy to see someone chalk it up to actual reasons instead of just 'banks are evil'\" personalizes the reply, establishing rapport through shared understanding of the original poster's frustrations.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques:\n- **First Response:** It employs logical and factual reasoning, using historical context (the opening of China) to support its argument.

{"index": 159, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: 'Historical' films that are 'based on a true story' should be strictly monitored for accuracy, if not outright banned.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI just watched *The Imitation Game* (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it ... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy). I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film ... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing\". This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character.\n\nSometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching *13 Days* (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the 'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was *actually there* argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever ... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified.\n\nThus, **I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.**\n\nI will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance:\n\n* \"They're claiming to be *based* on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" \n\nYes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films *appear* as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.\n\n* \"The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.\"\n\nBut to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows *absolutely nothing* about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching *JFK* (1991). And you know what, they *should* feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.\n\n* \"It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.\"\n\nSuck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch *Pearl Harbour* (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film: 'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, \"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nOkay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on *Pocahontas* (1995) and *Argo* (2012)) - please CMV!\n\n**EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments.

A few points:\n\n\n\n&gt; It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.\n\nActually, it really should. In any capacity. We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the \"true story\", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.\n\n\n\n&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).\n\nHow someone interprets the word \"based\" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.\n\n\n\n&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.\n\nWhile it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of \"documentary\" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  \n\n\n\n&gt;\"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nBecause people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. \n\n\n\n\nI'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?\n\nSecond Response: \nYou answered your own debate... *\"Suck it up, if you want to learn history, watch a documentary.*\n\nBut to address some of your points: If you want to see a \"proper film\" about Pearl Harbor, watch *Tora! Tora! Tora!*. That movie is so factually correct that the 'historical accuracy' debates are mostly about the obvious bits (American carriers had to pretend to be Japanese ones, since the Japanese ones were on the bottom of the ocean), and some less obvious bits about which particular sub-model of aircraft was (or sometimes should have been) used as the basis for mocked up models used in the film. (That's why Michael Bay felt the need to go so far beyond the actual facts, he was trying to separate his film from the others, mainly from this one.)\n\nBut what happens in a case like this? You have a movie that's based on a true story, uses two different books as its foundation, was made with countless technical advisors, the stories of numerous American and Japanese battle participants, the full cooperation of the military to collaborate on complex (and massive) ship and aircraft movements... the works... and they still made mistakes. At what point is a production designer saying \"This engine cowling looks cooler\" different from a scriptwriter saying \"This battle seems cooler\"? And what about information that remained classified in 1970 that's come to light since? Should we retroactively ban films?\n\nWhat happens when it's something like *Braveheart*, where certain facts are (and will remain forever) unknown? Is that story simply off-limits for all time (or until we build a time machine)?\n\n\"Based on a true story\" does not mean (and has never meant) historical accuracy. It means \"We didn't come up with the basis for this story, and we've paid someone for the rights to use *their* story as the basis for our film instead\". Notice the difference in the disclaimers at the beginning of most films ('Based on a true story' flashing onscreen for a few seconds) compared to *Tora! Tora! Tora!* (which takes like 3 minutes to go over their attempts at accuracy).\n\nI think the larger failing in your primary example isn't that \"historical fiction\" about the Cold War was used as the basis for your History class, it's that education should be less about dumping information into student's heads, and more about teaching them to acquire and critically evaluate the information they do receive.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Analyzing both responses to the original post reveals distinctive stylistic elements that contribute to their potential effectiveness in changing the original poster's (OP's) view.\n\n**First Response:**\n\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response maintains a sympathetic yet challenging tone.

{"index": 161, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: People who hunt have a sadistic trait\n\nOriginal Post: \nEdit: YOU HAVE CHANGED MY VIEW. (Only regarding hunting for food) \n\nThis isn't about Cecil the lion but it did get me thinking.....people who hunt must be at least a bit sadistic. Hear me out - I'm not here to make a dig at hunters. I don't eat meat myself but I actually believe hunting game as a source of meat is much more ethical than eating mass produced factory farmed animals. Game animals have at least had a natural life without chemicals, genetic engineering and is the ultimate in animal welfare. You can't beat having the life nature dictates. So I'm in conflict with what is actually involved in hunting. \nLets take an example of a hunting a deer. A healthy meat with a plentiful population to chose from. So you go out into its habitat, learn its habits, track it and then finally you see it. Quietly in its happily eating some food. Minding its own business. Full of life and so majestic in its natural habitat. This stunning beast is a pleasure to see.  I believe many hunters genuinely have a lot of respect for the animals they hunt. But then full of all that respect BOOM! They take its life. Just like that. All that effort to understand it, follow it and watch it they extinguished  in a second.  Cold hard logic can indeed justify why the animal is killed but deep down the pleasure hunters feel when they've killed an animal doesn't make sense to me. \n\n\nFirst Response: \nI applaud deer hunters in my area because we have way too many deer. Car/deer interactions are high in my former state. I know. I've hit one. Deer populations are out of wack because we removed alpha predators. There are too many of them and the health of the herd is affected. \n\nHunters either kill deer or deer populations grow to the point where they starve to death. Nature doesn't really mess around. \n\nI would much rather a deer died from a clean bullet wound than from a slow death of starvation or the aftermath of a car strike. \n\nSecond Response: \nI'm just starting out hunting, and I've taken some small game, but I don't do it just to see something die, and I hope I never do. I do it because I like the food, I like being outdoors, I like knowing my meat was harvested as painlessly as possible, and in the U.S. it helps prevent habitat destruction by both funding conservation and managing populations that have had their natural predators removed by human intrusion and poor hunting practices prior to the current system. I want future generations to see whitetail deer, water fowl, and wild turkeys, and  can help preserve them by hunting responsibly, while getting some free range organic food out of it. \nEdit: I want to add that when I pull the trigger, I feel a mix of emotions. Seeing something die by your own hands is unpleasant, and I don't get a single bit of pleasure for the act of killing. At the same time, the feeling of accomplishment after spending hours scouting and tracking is a huge rush. I know a lot of hunters say a prayer over their kill, and while I am not religious, I do pause to reflect and respect an animal's passing\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more personal and reflective tone, sharing the responder's own experiences and emotions related to hunting. This vulnerability likely resonates more with the original poster, fostering empathy and understanding. In contrast, the first response is more factual and analytical, which may not engage the original poster's emotional conflict as effectively.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second responder utilizes personal anecdotes and nuanced reflections on their feelings about hunting, allowing them to convey a deeper understanding of the emotional complexities involved.

{"index": 162, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I believe there is no moral framework in which it is permissible to eat meat but not to have sex with animals.\n\nOriginal Post: \nEdit: I have offered a delta in this thread, but I would really like more responses, because the one I offered a delta to was for a bit of a pedantic point. Please don't let it dissuade you from answering. Also, the title should read: \"there is no *consistent* moral framework\". The mere existence of a framework is not a very interesting point to debate.\n\nA few things first: I do eat meat, and I don't want have sex with animals. I believe both eating meat and having sex with animals are wrong. I think that the reason that I eat meat despite believing it is wrong is that it's simply what I've been doing my whole life.\n\nOkay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.\n\nConsider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam\n\nHow can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?\n\nI don't see a justification for either behavior on 'natural' grounds because while I think that both the consumption of meat and the desire to have sex with animals can come about naturally (that is to say, not artificially) there are plenty of things which occur naturally (rape, infanticide, kidnapping) that we all agree are immoral.\n\nAfter giving out three deltas, I think my view on the question as I posed it has been changed. I think if I could go back in time I would probably have said \"CMV: If it is immoral to have sex with animals, then it is immoral to eat them\" but as far as the existence of consistent moral frameworks justifying one of the behaviours but not the other, I am thoroughly convinced.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nThe benefit gained by eating an animal is much greater than the benefit gained by having sex with one (I would even argue that there are zero benefits to having sex with an animal).  Therefore, eating animals has a higher threshold of harm caused before the net result is a harmful effect rather than a beneficial one.  With having sex with animals, the threshold is extremely low, perhaps even to the point that any harm caused causes the action to become a net harmful action.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.\n\n&gt;Consider this how-to on collecting bull semen for the purpose of analysis: http://www.wikihow.com/Collect-Semen-from-a-Bull-for-a-Breeding-Soundness-Exam\n\n&gt;How can anybody claim that a bull would consent to the insertion of an electric probe into its anus and how is that morally different from a zoophile inserting their penis into a bull's anus?\n\nIn the case of semen collection, there is the benefit at the end of having the sperm needed to create a new generation of cattle (to which the bull is also a recipient of the benefit, even if they do not consciously relize it).  In the case of a zoophile inserting their  penis, there is no equivalent benefit gained by anyone.\n\nYou may not subscribe to my moral framework, but to me it is very consistent, logical, and easy to follow.  I make an estimate of the pro's and con's of every action and then come to an estimate of whether each action is a net positive or a net negative (when compared to other possible actions, impossible theoretical scenarios are not included into the calculation as they are not possible).  At the end, I describe whatever action has the most net benefit as the most moral, and whichever has the most net harm as the least moral.  This does mean that many actions that some people see as equivalent in their own moral system are seen as unrelated in mine, as in the case of carnivorism versus zoophilia.  The central tenant of consent in your own moral system does not factor very heavily in mine.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; Okay, so, the best argument I know for it being immoral to have sex with animals is that they are incapable of consent and that therefore sexual behaviour with animals is rape. I cannot imagine that any animal would give its consent to dying just in order to satisfy a person's appetite. Furthermore, I don't see a moral difference between acts of bestiality and some methods of animal husbandry.\n\nI don't see the inconsistency. Perhaps sex acts *simply do* require consent, whereas eating non-sapient animals *simply doesn't* require consent. Where is the contradiction?\n\nBut here are a few moral frameworks, and arguments from each. Note that it isn't so important whether these frameworks are *true*, only that they are consistent frameworks which justify both beliefs in question.\n\n* Natural Law theories seek to ground norms in their natural *purpose*. The *purpose* for sex might be procreation. Therefore, sex with animals is wrong, since procreation is impossible. (An alternate purpose might be solidifying bonds with one's partner. But, while this purpose may exist between humans, it is dubious it could work between humans and non-human animals. Bestiality is plausibly psychologically harmful.) Carnivorism, on the other hand, doesn't seem impermissible on natural law theory.\n* Consequentialism holds that consequences are the primary aspect of moral consideration. Perhaps eating animals leads to greater net happiness. (Maybe not the current methods of factory farming, but what about responsible free range farming, where animals have good lives before being taken for food?) Perhaps bestiality contributes net negative consequences. Under such conditions (which aren't necessarily that implausible), consequentialism would entail that bestiality is wrong, but eating meat is, in some cases, permissible.\n* Virtue Ethics entails that a person's character attributes are the primary aspect of moral evaluation. Perhaps a virtuous character would eat meat in many circumstances (like if he knew it wasn't prepared irresponsibly with extravagant suffering, for example) but wouldn't have sex with animals. (Perhaps because they believed it destroyed the dignity of both the human and the non-human animal?)\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To determine which response was more effective in changing the original poster's view, let's analyze their stylistic elements.\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response adopts a more analytical tone.

{"index": 163, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: There is no practical reason for any individual to vote in national elections\n\nOriginal Post: \nBy \"practical reason,\" I mean a reason that motivates you to vote by ascribing a cause-effect relationship between the action of voting and the outcome of the election.  I admit there can be other reasons to vote--social pressure, solidarity, civic pride, etc.  But on a practical level, I can reasonably expect no difference between the world in which I vote and the world in which I stay home, except that in the former I'd have to go out of my way to perform additional actions.  If I'm trying to decide whether to perform those actions, based on pure self-interest, there is no reason for me to vote.  I'm setting this at the level of national elections (specifically thinking of U.S. elections) because it's true that, given a small enough \"nation,\" your individual vote would carry a significant probability of making a difference.  \n\nThis is a classic example of a [collective action problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action), and after considering this class of problems thoroughly, I've come to the conclusion that there is no self-interested practical reason to participate in these cases, barring external motivators (such as added incentives).\n\nIt would be nice to find a reason to believe this isn't a case, so I look forward to someone convincing me!\n\nFirst Response: \nJust because it's incredibly unlikely that your vote will make a difference doesn't mean it's never going to happen. Suppose a state like Wyoming (voter turnout of 249,000 last general election) was polling 50/50 (or 47/47, or 43/43, etc.) going into the election. A Wyomingite could guess there's a thousand or so votes separating the candidates at most, and determine that these odds are worth the minimal investment required to make the trip to the voting booths.\n\nAnd it's not like this is purely theoretical either - there have been a few examples of state elections being decided by only a couple hundreds of votes. A 1974 Senate election (223,000 votes) in New Hampshire was decided by **2** votes only. Maybe sooner or later it'll be decided by one.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe same ballot for Presidential and Congressional elections will also have a number of other state and local positions and issues that are up for vote, many of which your vote would be significant (only 1000s or even 100s of voters).  For example, during the last Presidential election, there was a ballot initiative to merge the town next to mine that failed to pass, 72-72 votes.\n\nWhile it might not make sense to go out of your way just to vote for those elections in which your vote is insignificant, it does make sense if you are already there to vote for things where your vote is significant.  Then you are putting in a very low amount of effort for a very low amount of impact.\n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post, let's break down their stylistic elements:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - **First Response**: The tone is somewhat assertive, as it presents a counterargument based on statistical reasoning while emphasizing the potential impact every vote can have. It appeals to a sense of logical reasoning by illustrating a clear example from U.S. elections and expressing that while unlikely, the possibility of a vote making a difference exists.\n   - **Second Response**: This response has a more pragmatic tone, focusing on the idea of hidden benefits in the act of voting.

Thank you!\n\nFirst Response: \nThis is really more of a /r/etiquette question, so I am going to answer it like that.\n\nAfter a certain point couples are considered a social unit, in is inappropriate in most cases to invite one and not the other. So at what point are couples considered a social unit? A good rule of thumb was historically engaged or married, and a more modern view is engaged, married, living together for a significant amount of time. The point is they should be in a long-term committed relationship and have something showing that level of commitment. \n\nFor this party I would invite only those couple who follow the rules above, engaged, married, living together a significant amount of time. That way if people companion you have a general rule you can point to. \n\nNow that we have background, lets better approach your view.\n\n&gt;Is it a major etiquette fuckup if you don't invite plus ones? Should I just suck it up?\n\nYes and Yes. It is important to understand that etiquette exists to put us all on equal footing. By having these semi-formal rules means that everyone can know how to behave, and what messages their behavior sends. In the case of invitations, snubbing some SOs and not others without logic like above sends a very clear message. It is a sign that you don't respect the person you are inviting or their significant other or their relationship. You are also making a statement that the person you invited needs to choose between respecting their SO or coming to your event, not exactly a kind position to put someone in. \n\n---\n\nIf we're gong to address etiquette, I would be rather remiss to not point out that is considered poor taste to host your own birthday party. \n\nSecond Response: \nIf I was to get invited to something, but my finance wasn't invited you're placing me in a bad spot. \n\nI mean sure I can go to your party, but there might be a pissed off woman I have to answer to when I get home. And it isn't always her being uncool. It does suck to be rejected. \n\nAnd honestly, some people are going to choose to have a good night with their gf or such than go to your party. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor in predicting that the first response successfully changed the original poster's view lies in its structured engagement and the use of etiquette rationale.

Correlation and causation are different ideas. It's not even a rectangle/square kind of relationship. Correlation is *evidence* for or against causation, but it never makes sense to say that a Correlation *is a* causation. It's a category error even when the causal relationship *exists*.\n\nSecond, your clarification doesn't get to the heart of the misunderstandings. Everyone already knows the essence of what you're trying to more clearly imply. No one thinks that correlation is somehow evidence *against* causation.\n\nThat said, the phrase is certainly often used as a copout. If you're trying to argue for causation,  correlations on their own are insufficient. To make a really compelling case, you need to hypothesize a mechanism by which the causation takes place, and that hypothesis will yield addition tests to run. If you're arguing against causation,  you're right that Correlation does not equal causation,  but if someone presents a compelling Correlation that you have no explanation for, you're argument is going to look pretty weak.

Surely the officer would draw his/ her weapon at the murderer and scream to get down. They would proceed to cuff them and bring them to the station for booking/ questioning. If an officer called in for back-up after killing someone (even if was obviously out of self defense) they would be approached with \"hey are you okay?\" and \"Let's get the paperwork out of the way so you can have your paid leave.\" That to me is hypocritical. Take away the uniform and you have a person who just killed another person.\n\n2. It would make officers think twice before drawing. If they knew they would be processed and charged with murder, I would argue that there would a significant decline in police shootings.\n\n3. It gives the victim a fair chance at their side. Even if they are dead, treating an officer like a criminal discredits any story they come up with giving a better chance for the true series of events to surface. We have seen A LOT of cops make up shit that \"justifies\" the killing when later proved wrong by cameras. If people could just make up stories and be believed 100%, I could go outside right now, shoot someone in the head while no one is looking, plant a knife, claim they came at me with a knife, and get away with 2nd degree murder.\n\nEven if an officer witnessed another officer kill a person when it was blatantly self-defense (eg the person had a gun pointed at the officer) they should still be cuffed and taken in. Just apply the same situation to 2 citizens, surely the one who lives would be charged with murder and only the results of an investigation would set them free.\n\nI'm just frustrated with all the bull shit I hear about cops and would like to hear the logic of the other side because I feel I'm blinded from it. So CMV.\n\nEdit: Okay, too many people are correcting me on minor technicalities which isn't helping. You **cannot** deny that there is an obvious bias when it comes to determining if an officer killing someone is justified or not, at least compared to a citizen killing another citizen. I just believe that bias should not exist.\n\nFirst Response: \nThe first thing you need to recognize is that a police officer isn't just another citizen. They have specialized training because their job puts them in a level of danger that other people don't face. The only comparable group is the military, and that justifies a special set of rules. If all you see is a few cases of unjustified homicide, and you completely ignore the danger that *millions* of officers confront and handle *daily*, then there is no hope to change your view.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe problem is that people want to make the jobs of police officers impossible and that is what you are doing. This of it this way. If you were a police officer and they made your idea into law would you continue to be a police officer? Hell no. \n\nIf police were held to the same laws as other citizens while they were working the job would actually be impossible and no sane person would sign up to do it. How would you suggest a police officer give a speeding ticket without speeding to catch the guy? It would be impossible. Now extend this to a police officer that is called for a possible armed robbery. How could the police officer defuse the situation and possibly save someones life if they were worried about getting arrested for murder?\n\nI'm not saying there isn't a problem with police in this country but there is clearly also a problem with the way this countries citizens view the law. People view the law as suggestions and often ignore them. In so many of these high profile police cases the citizen is blatantly refusing to cooperate this the officer. This is an issue on both sides of the law there. There is mistrust for the government and usually the officer uses too much force or is racially biased. Both things need to change.\n\nThe most famous case of police misuse of force (Michael Brown) still really bugs me. People got up in arms because the officer didn't get put in prison for murder. The thing is there clearly wasn't enough evidence to convict that officer of murder. It was always obvious. That officer went on trial for murder and a bunch of people filed conflicting police reports on what happened so any eye witness account was put into question. The people that filed police reports when they didn't know what they were doing fucked up that case and might have got a guilty man set free.

{"index": 167, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I support resources and help centers for male rape victims, but I don't see male rape as severe as female rape.\n\nOriginal Post: \nHey fellow Redditors! I'm a male myself and I just have trouble equating female rape with male rape. I perfectly understand that non-consensual sex is rape regardless of gender, and I encourage all men who have been sexually abused to immediately seek help, but I have trouble feeling as bad for men who are raped and it's hard for me to weigh the impact of that rape on their lives. \n\nThe reason is because whenever I think of women getting raped, I think of a strong (and sometimes old) man who clearly has power of a much weaker woman forcing her to do things that she finds derogatory. The fact that women are the prominent gender in the sex slave trade doesn't help. That only makes me feel like a man raping a woman is essentially treating her like property and belittling her humanity. Also, although I can't prove this scientifically, we all know at least that society views men as horny fucks who are out there just to fuck women. This evokes some feeling in me that women are men's \"prey\" and they are the victims who have to put up with this feeling of worthlessness. \n\nWhenever I think of a man getting raped however, I think of a guy who has had a little too much to drink and is being coerced into sex by a woman who finds him attractive. Yeah, he may not want to have sex with her, and yeah at that point he is way too weak to resist, but because he's a man, there's something inside of me that feels like he can deal with this and it's simply just another night that didn't go so well. Now as for gay men, that's different and I can sympathize with them more, especially if they were the ones who were penetrated. Even though I feel that way with gays, I still don't think of rape of gay men as bad as rape of women.\n\nI guess I may see being penetrated unwillingly as worse than having to penetrate someone against your will. But the fact that toughness and security are associated with males and feebleness and innocence are associated with women also doesn't help. \n\nI really do hate my stance on this because I like to think of myself as a benevolent person who wants the common good for everyone. Please tell my why I should *think* of male rape as bad as female rape. Again, I really want my view to change. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This can either be with an object (by a woman or man), or by another man.

When and if she chooses to allow someone into the temple, it is in some way devalued.  \n\nMens bodies aren't seen the same way.  The are seen as inherently the defilers, and not as something pure that can be devalued.  This even applies to gay men raped by other men; They just don't have that inherent purity to be stolen that a woman, any woman, has.  \n\nIf we sit back and examine this, and the purity culture that produced it, we have a chance to see that from the standpoint of the individual that is overpowered or tricked into an intimate activity there is no difference.  Internalized purity culture is the reason women may feel worse about being raped than men do, and why we are more sympathetic to them, but the net result is the same- use of our physical self by another person against our will.   \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the depth of engagement and the nuanced exploration of the topic presented in the second response.

{"index": 168, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Transgender people are still technically their original gender.\n\nOriginal Post: \nHi guys!\n\n\nTo expand:\n\nAlthough I would happily call someone who went from being a man to a woman (- for example) a woman to their face and when talking about them, I still don't believe they are truly that gender. Despite having surgery, having that mindset and having hormone treatment, I can't feel fully comfortable referring to them as a woman - just from a technical standpoint. I feel as though I'm lying to myself.\n\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nI am not homophobic or anything of the sort. I completely agree with people doing what they want to do and I completely believe people can be 'trapped' in the body of the opposite gender.\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;I feel as though I'm lying to myself.\n\nWhy? And what 'technical standpoint' are you referring to? Gender is mostly a surface level set of assumptions we make about other people to orient which social norms we should apply when interacting with them. Sure, biology has some influence and in a *very* few realms, might be a concern, but in terms of how we treat people in a day-to-day environment there's no reason trans people are not their gender.\n\nSecond Response: \nTrans people are not uniformly the same as their supposed pre-transition sex. There are *biological* differences between trans people and their pre-trans sex. These include genetic differences, and differences in the brain.\n\n**Genetic differences found only in trans individuals:**\n\nMtF Trans individuals have been found to have genetic differences that cause their biology to bind testosterone differently than males.\n\n&gt;The androgen receptor (AR), also known as NR3C4, is activated by the binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, where it plays a critical role in the forming of primary and secondary male sex characteristics. Hare et al. found that male-to-female transsexuals were found to have longer repetitions of the gene, which reduced its effectiveness at binding testosterone.\n\n**Brain structure differences found only in trans individuals:**\n\n&gt;Zhou et al. (1995) found that in a region of the brain called the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTc), a region known for sex and anxiety responses, MTF transsexuals have a female-normal size while FTM transsexuals have a male-normal size. While the transsexuals studied had taken hormones, this was accounted for by including non-transsexual male and female controls who, for a variety of medical reasons, had experienced hormone reversal. The controls still retained sizes typical for their gender.\n\nand\n\n&gt;The interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH3), part of the hypothalamic uncinate nucleus. The same method of controlling for hormone usage was used as in Zhou et al. (1995) and Kruijver et al. (2000). The differences were even more pronounced than with BSTc; control males averaged 1.9 times the volume and 2.3 times the neurons as control females, yet once again, regardless of hormone exposure, MTF transsexuals lay within the female range and the FTM transsexual within the male range.\n\n**Prenatal androgen exposure:**\n\n&gt;Prenatal androgen exposure, the lack thereof, or poor sensitivity to prenatal androgens are commonly cited mechanisms to explain the above discoveries. Schneider, Pickel, and Stalla (2006) found a correlation between digit ratio (a generally accepted marker for prenatal androgen exposure) and male to female transsexualism. MTF transsexuals were found to have a higher digit ratio than control males, but one that was comparable to control females\n\nSo no, they were not \"technically their own original gender\", because their original biological characteristics did not conform to a typical member of their supposed previous sex in the first place.\n\nDoes this help change your view?\n\n[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism)\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In analyzing the responses to the original post, we can observe distinct stylistic elements that may influence the original poster's views regarding transgender identities.\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response adopts a casual and conversational tone, using rhetorical questions to challenge the original poster's claims and provoke self-reflection.

{"index": 170, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: My vote in an election doesn't matter\n\nOriginal Post: \nI really want someone to change my view on this, since everyone i know are frowning on me for thinking this way.\n\nMy argument is, that just with my single vote, i'm statistically extremely unlikely to make a significant difference. Whether i vote or not is irrelevant on that scale. The obvious argument against me, that i hear time and time again, is that my vote is a vote in a bigger picture. But that still doesn't counter my argument that a *single* vote doesn't matter. Statistically.\n\nPlease change my view, if any of you can refute my arguments above.\n\nFirst Response: \nThe point of a vote is not linked to whether it will have an immediate effect on the outcome; if that's the way you think about votes, then the \"best outcome\" is actually just having one person vote from the side that would have otherwise won (that's, surprisingly enough, the game theoretic Nash equilibrium). However, people continue to vote in elections that they're sure they will lose? Why?\n\nBecause the importance of the vote is not bound to whether it has an effect on an election; it's not bound to whether the Socialist Party candidate does or doesn't get into office. It is instead important because it is a meaningful statement endorsing a certain view of society. It is important for the same reason that a protest is important, even if it doesn't change anyone's mind- it is participation in civil society advocating for one's principles. \n\nSecond Response: \nThis would be an extremely individualistic point of view. Societies tend to create change together. Voting in an election is a part of this. Electing a candidate to public office is a communal undertaking. You may be right that your individual vote may not make much of a difference in the actual count, but the candidate you prefer would not get elected without the backing of a community. So the question really is, do you want to be a part of that community?\n\nMoreover, you can't assume that your decision on whether or not to vote only affects yourself. It's a myth of the modern world that a personal decision has no effect on the society around us. By not voting you're making a statement - that your vote doesn't really matter. Voting in an election is meaningless, it's a waste of time, etc. That is an opinion - and opinions can influence people. Imagine your neighbour was convinced by your behaviour not to vote either. And he influenced his family and friends. And so it spreads. If everyone was as \"enlightened\" as you, democracy would wither and die.\n\nThe fundamental error you're making is in thinking that voting is about you. It's not. It's about your community. It's about contributing to its wellbeing by lending your voice in support of good governance. It's a bit like volunteering to help victims in a disaster zone, say, in Nepal. You'd just be one of hundreds of thousands of aid workers making their way there. Pose the same question - what difference can I really make? - in this situation, and you'd intuitively see how it is duty to lend your aid to this cause. Same goes with government. By choosing not to vote, you're choosing not to hold your government to account, or ensure the competence of your elected officials. And that decision affects everybody. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that leads to this prediction is the Second Response's effective engagement with the original poster's perspective.

{"index": 171, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Ads on Hulu are no different from ads we've gotten on cable TV for decades, and people who complain about it are just spoiled.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis is something that I just have such a hard time understanding.  For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for large bundles of channels that you might not even want.  Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have offered a great way to circumvent that process at a much more affordable price and are completely changing the way we view content.\n\nAnd yet I still see so many people getting so wound up over watching ads on Hulu.  My perception of their argument is this: \"I pay for Hulu, so I shouldn't have to see ads.\"  Maybe I'm over-simplifying it, but I just haven't seen any other viable argument that really says anything beyond that.\n\nNow, I should say I definitely understand hating ads.  I live in the city, and I can't walk ten feet out my door without someone trying to sell me something.  We are over-saturated by advertising and it's awful.  Thankfully with more options to block advertising on the internet, it's forcing advertisers to create ads that are more entertaining and feel less obtrusive (although, sometimes it does also force the opposite).\n\nBut even though I hate advertising as much as a lot of people do, I still recognize it as a vital part of what makes television work, and since I really like being able to know what happens on my favorite shows every week, I don't get my panties in a twist over it.\n\nI see a lot of people getting wound up who have little understanding of how a service like Hulu works.  I'm certainly not an expert either, but I have an understanding of how the licensing process works and how expensive it can be.  Netflix may be able to get by without ads, but Hulu offers something that Netflix doesn't: content from television that is current and has recently aired.\n\nNetflix usually won't provide new episodes of a show until an entire season is finished.  And even then, it might be a few months until even that happens.  The only current content they do have is their own original programming, which they can get away with because they own the licenses and don't have to pay any licensing fees or performance royalties to any outside production company.\n\nI've seen a lot of my favorite shows on Hulu have episodes be online just hours after it airs on live TV.  Since I dropped cable years ago, this is one of my favorite things about it.  I don't necessarily like that advertising is part of my subscription, but I also realize that Hulu has to license this content from production companies, who have had a history of being apprehensive when it comes to embracing changing technologies.  They are likely charging much higher licensing fees and royalties which means that Hulu in turns has to find other sources of income beyond subscription fees in order to make it work.  Not to mention that the networks themselves probably have their own fees since they probably have exclusivity deals with the production companies who make the programming.\n\nPeople are so quick to jump to the \"X company is a bunch of greedy corporate whores\" argument without understand the major complexities that go into making a service like Hulu work.  I'm sure Hulu is well aware that their subscribers don't like watching ads.  \"I don't like watching ads\" is even an option in their survey when you cancel your account.  People went on the same tirade when Netflix raised its prices, and I remember thinking the same thing then.\n\nI think that people's displeasure with advertising will ultimately shift services in the direction of removing advertising, but I still think that's a long way off.  Streaming services, despite being around for several years now, are still in their infancy in a lot of ways.  It's going to take a while to allow everyone to adapt and a lot of companies will be resistant to it in the hopes they can retain their old business models.  But I don't see any of this as the fault of Hulu for using advertising.\n\nSo my real curiosity here is to find an argument against Hulu's advertising that I haven't seen.  I see so many people upset about it, but I feel like my only understanding of their argument is that they're spoiled and don't want to see ads, which I recognize can be straw-manning on my part.

I'm still kind of skeptical about some people's criticisms towards Hulu, but I'm definitely more understanding of why people don't want to pay for ads.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I grew up without tv, so from my perspective, everyone else seems to be slow-boiled into accepting ads. I loath them, and if there isn't a good reason to have ads on a service then I don't see a good reason to pay for it or them. I see this as voting with my dollar. \n\nIf you remember, Hulu originally said they would offer payed tiers that would allow for more expensive shows to be ad-free with the higher cost subscriptions (I liked this idea). When they axed this plan I bowed out. Fulfilling a persons desires in a marketplace is how innovation happens and at the moment Hulu is not innovating in my direction\u2014so they don't get my money. Other companies *are* innovating in my direction. \n\nI'm also spoiled about having a machine to wash my clothes and ride a car instead of a horse.  \n\nSecond Response: \nInitially, Hulu was ad free, and then they slowly added more and more ads. And it's a few ads over and over again. And then you pay for the Hulu Plus subscription, but some shows are **still** \"Web only\" or require you to authenticate through a cable/satellite provider. Or they still don't get the current season (for example, the History Channel's Vikings series). All in all, it seems like you're paying every month just to have a bunch of ads shoved down your throat.\n\nI cancelled when I got fed up with the combination of ads and the lack of availability of some shows for the aforementioned reasons.\n\nI don't think people necessarily feel entitled to this entertainment, but they may see a bad value prop and think Hulu is being run by the same old clueless TV execs who are the reason you don't bother with a cable subscription in the first place.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post regarding ads on Hulu, we will compare their stylistic elements and emotional approaches:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is confrontational but slightly dispassionate, relating the issue to a personal principle (\"voting with my dollar\"), which shows a sense of control and empowerment. The expression of disdain for ads is present but feels more like a personal opinion than a vehement protest.\n   - **Second Response:** This response has a more frustrated and annoyed tone, expressing disappointment with Hulu\u2019s service evolution. The phrasing suggests an emotional investment, describing Hulu's advertising as \"shoved down your throat.\" This emphasizes a sense of being wronged by the service, which could resonate more deeply with other frustrated users.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - **First Response:** Utilizes personal anecdotes (\"I grew up without tv\") and contrasts past expectations (ad-free tiers) with current experiences. This technique invites readers to consider their perspectives but does so in a more detached manner.\n   - **Second Response:** Uses direct references to Hulu's past policies (\"Hulu was ad free\") and draws contrasts between what the user expected and received. This creates a narrative structure that builds frustration and aligns with the audience's potential grievances, enhancing relatability.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - **First Response:** The sentence structure is varied but tends to lean towards longer, more complex sentences which can impact readability. The argument flows logically, but because of the complexity, it may take more effort for some readers to grasp the core point quickly.\n   - **Second Response:** The sentence structure is concise and straightforward. The use of short sentences gives it punch and clarity, which enhances readability. This could make the arguments more impactful for readers skimming for key points.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n   - **First Response:** Engages by challenging the original poster to clarify their stance and offering an alternative perspective that is somewhat removed from the emotional charge of the issue. It invites dialogue but does not actively seek to sympathize with the original poster's experience.\n   - **Second Response:** Directly interacts with some of the grievances expressed in the original post, addressing the contradiction of paying for ads. This responsive style fosters a connection with the original poster's concerns and aligns more closely with shared frustrations.\n\n**Prediction:**\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factor(s) That Led to the Prediction:**\nThe second response effectively taps into the emotional dissatisfaction surrounding Hulu\u2019s ad practices and aligns closely with the emotions and frustrations expressed by the original poster. Its direct engagement with the original post, along with concise and impactful language, likely resonates more with the original poster, thus making it more persuasive in changing their viewpoint.

Meaning, minorities/persons of color/foreign nationals cannot be racist because they do not benefit from their discrimination. Whereas the majority are inherently racist because they are privy to a system, be it political or societal, that favors their ethnicity.\n\nI don't understand how definitively discriminatory actions cannot be considered racist, because of the characteristics of a person.

The history of an oppressor using their position of power to oppress on the basis of a small characteristic is what makes racism racism.\n\nif this history wasn't involved, and people simply used race as a way to describe people (even if poorly), no one would care about racism. If it wasn't used to degrade, it would just be a form of random classification, not racism.\n\nSo in the case of someone from an oppressed class stating that they can not be racist, they recognize that their status as an oppressed class means that they do not have the power to oppress in the way someone from a powerful class would. and to someone from the oppressed class, the concept of racism is not just about classifying by race, but about classifying by race with the intent to oppress. since the oppressed can't systematically oppresses the powerful, they can't be reverse racist in the true sense of the term racist.\n\n\nSecond Response: \nReverse racism is not a thing. \n\nRacism is judging one race as superior to another, and discriminating against someone due to their race. Using the term \"Reverse Racism\" feeds the very concept that someone who is in privileged position cannot be treated in a racist manner. \n\nEthnic Minorities can be racist, and Ethnic Majorities can be treated in a racist manner. Power is not a component of racism that is a component of something called \"Institutional Racism\". \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response employs a more nuanced exploration of racism, intertwining historical context and the definition of oppression, which likely appeals to the original poster's intellectual curiosity. The tone is informative and empathetic; it acknowledges the original poster's confusion while providing a thorough explanation. The response utilizes rhetorical techniques such as cause-and-effect reasoning to clarify the concept of racism, helping the original poster see the distinction between individual discriminatory acts and systemic oppression. \n\nIn terms of sentence structure, the first response is dense yet well-structured, leveraging complex ideas without overwhelming the reader. It engages directly with the original post by addressing the posted question point-by-point and providing an in-depth analysis of why reverse racism, as understood by the poster, may not align with the established definitions of racism.\n\nIn contrast, the second response is more assertive and less elaborative, presenting a straightforward rejection of \"reverse racism\" without the same depth of explanation. This might not resonate as strongly with an original poster who is seeking clarification and debate rather than a simple dismissal. By contrasting simplistic definitions against the complexities of societal power dynamics, the first response likely has a stronger chance of changing the original poster's viewpoint as it encourages reflection rather than simply stating an opinion. \n\nOverall, the thoroughness, empathetic tone, and detailed reasoning in the first response stand out as more compelling, suggesting that it would be more effective in altering the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 173, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The Jesus Myth Hypothesis is Plausible\n\nOriginal Post: \nCrossposted from a comment on /r/skeptic\n\nI've read David Fitzgerald, some of Richard Carrier, and the criticisms of both and it seems to me that there is a lot of vitriol on both sides. The mythicists take umbrage at being dismissed as amateurs and dabblers and vociferously defend their hypotheses, the historicists take umbrage at the strenuous attacks, and it all gets very torrid very quickly, and becomes very difficult to actually analyze the actual strength of the arguments.\n\nSo, as a skeptic, I'm sufficiently intrigued by the Mythicist arguments to profess agnosticism as to the Historical Jesus, for the following reasons:\n\n* There are no extrabiblical attestations of any significant event from the life of Jesus. On the contrary, events such as the slaughter of the innocents, the census of all the Empire are clearly fictitious, and multiple miracles, the triumphal entry to Jerusalem, and multiple events surrounding the crucifixion are absent from all historical records when there's a reasonable chance that some account of them would have survived, had they occurred at all.\n*  The synoptic problem indicates that we are working from at most one source that even approaches being primary, and even that most likely written much later, anonymously, and as hagiography rather than history.\n*  Well into the third century, pagan sources mostly recount the existence of Christians and document the claims of Christians. This is at best hearsay.\n* attempts to reconstruct the \"real\" historical Jesus are invariably unprovable and contradictory with one another--there is no consensus.\n* While the vast bulk of NT scholarship presumes an historical Jesus, the \"scholarly consensus\" should be given less weight since for centuries, such research has been largely a devotional undertaking. Jesus mythicism is very nearly literally heretical, as well as figuratively. At least sufficiently that it deserves consideration even though a strong consensus exists that contradicts it.\n\n\nSo, we accept the historical reality of many persons throughout ancient history based on much less proof than gospels and various other pagan mentions. So maybe there was an itinerant sage named Yeshua who ran around, gathered a minor following, and was executed for sedition. But the problems above mean A) we know nothing about him and B) almost everything written about him is unknowable or outright fictitious.\n\n\nI look at it as the difference between \"Abraham Lincoln\" and \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.\" Notwithstanding that there is an historical person that was the basis, the hero version is a myth.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Are you saying the statement \"There was no one behind the creation and spread of Christianity and the Jesus character did not exist in any form\" is plausible or \"The mythical aspects of Jesus are unconfirmed while it is likely that there was a man behind the myths in some aspect.\" My understanding is that Carrier says the former and I thought that was what you were saying.

In some places I'd be wary of cutting over to the leftmost lane to pass some people if it is 3+ lanes. In my anecdotal experience that's when you have to watch out for those guys the most. In all cases, I find it best to let the fastest drivers pass you, since (as others have noted) it is the safest thing to do as it deters tailgating and it reduces the chance you'll get pulled over for speeding yourself (even if you are already going well over).\n\nSecond Response: \nTraffic is generally safer when going slower. Traffic is also generally safer when there is little variance in speed, ie everyone is going about the same speed.\n\nIt seems intuitive to me that a larger variance in speed of different drivers would contribute to more accidents than a slower speed.

I have no stats to back that up and I very well might be wrong, but from my experience I believe this to be the case.\n\nIf that is correct, in order for the population to have the safest possible driving, people should drive as close to the average as possible.

{"index": 176, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: \"Cultural appropriation\" is fine as long as it's not overtly racist or disparaging. People have a right to use the art, styles, etc. that they like, and those who are offended are overreacting.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI think that people have a right to those artistic, cultural, and aesthetic forms that please them, and openly sharing and partaking of diverse ideas and styles makes the world a richer, more innovative, and better place. Saying that a particular style of dress, manner of speech, way of doing things, or cultural icon \"belongs\" to a particular group of people who have rights over who may use it and how is dogmatic and dictatorial. If a person wants to wear a kimono or headdress to imitate and mock Japanese people or Native Americans, that's obviously racist and offensive. But if someone wants to wear a kimono or headdress because they like the way they look, the usage of those forms is at worst benign and at best potentially a show of admiration for them and the cultures whence they come.\n\nFirst Response: \nI think there are two separate issues here.  First is whether people have a right to appropriate art.  Second is whether there is a legitimate basis for offense from those whose art is appropriated.\n\nI think the answer to the first is obviously that yes, you have a right to appropriate art.  Do what you want, wear what you want, and, as with anything, be aware that others will have reactions to what you do that you cannot control.  If you're fine with that, go ahead - you are a free person.  Anytime somebody tells you not to do something because it constitutes appropriation, you should assume that what they mean is \"I will be upset with you if you do this thing\" rather than \"you are not free to choose to do this thing\".\n\nThat is a separate question from whether those who feel their culture has been wrongfully appropriated have a legitimate grievance.  I think of appropriation as divorcing the artistic value of something from the cultural context in which it was created.  \n\nAn analogy that I like to use to illustrate this is  is the commercialization of Christmas - I'm sure there are many observant Christians who believe that Christmas traditions are intended to spring from a place of faith and reflection, and a belief that Christ is their savior. They probably see non-Christians (or non-observant Christians) as \"appropriating\" Christmas, in some regard, by tying it so closely to consumerism. Of course it is everybody's right to celebrate Christmas as they please, but I wouldn't begrudge a Christian for feeling like everyone else has \"ruined\" Christmas by taking it so far away from its spiritual roots.  Christians who strongly and genuinely object to the commercialization of Christmas are clearly a minority in the U.S., and therefore their perception of the meaning of Christmas is out-voted by the relatively-less-Godly majority, and they lose control of society's dominant interpretation and valuation of the holiday.\n\nOther forms of cultural appropriation similarly divorce the entertainment value of certain art forms from the social context and life experiences that created it in the first place.  As a result, society sees that art and values it very differently from the intent of its creators, and depending on what those differences look like, it can be a perfectly understandable grievance that you as a potential appropriator are free to choose to concede to or ignore.  \n\nSecond Response: \nOk.  \n\nLet's put the shoe on the other foot.  Let's have Chinese Buddhists appropriate the dress of Roman Catholic priests.  And wear those robes to rock concerts.  Let's have rock stars play at baptism in their rock videos, and perhaps make Eucharist a dining out trend.  Now let's assume that you're a devout catholic.  How exactly do you feel watching people play with things that you consider absolutely sacred, given to you by Christ himself.  And people who don't understand it are using it as entertainment, pop culture, in general treating your religion as a joke to be mocked.\n\nThe point is that there are parts of any culture that are sacred.  Things that are never to be taken lightly by the culture or by outsiders without causing great offense.  And quite often those things end up appropriated for entertainment.  By people with very little understanding of what it is that they're taking.  Quite often those who take even end up selling those trends and make a lot of money, while the original culture doesn't get much.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the emotional engagement and hypothetical scenario presented in the second response. The use of a relatable analogy\u2014inviting the original poster to consider how they would feel if their own cultural symbols were appropriated\u2014invokes empathy and reflection. This engages the original poster on a deeper emotional level, prompting them to think critically about the implications of their stance. The second response critiques the original post by highlighting potential unintended consequences of cultural appropriation and challenges the original poster to reconsider their position by placing them in an opposite scenario.\n\nIn contrast, the first response, while insightful and well-structured, primarily focuses on separating the issues of art appropriation from grievances about cultural context.

That is opening up a huge can of worms when it comes to the ADA. It's discrimination, and even though it is best for everyone else in the theater if that person were to leave, a company cannot leave themselves open to a potentially huge lawsuit. \n\nSecond Response: \nYour (and even the majority of the theater's) understanding of how to enjoy a movie is not necessarily the correct way.  Perhaps this kid really enjoys going to movies and, due to his disability or not, the way he interacts with movies is by making a lot of noise.  That it is \"more convenient for the majority of people to have it be this way\" is how minorities become disabled by society.  The phrase \"tyranny of the majority\" comes to mind.

The responder uses a clinical perspective by referencing the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act), which grounds their argument in legal foundations. This is likely meant to provoke thought, flipping the OP's emotional turmoil into legal implications to invoke a sense of responsibility.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** The response utilizes factual evidence and authority by mentioning their experience in the business, lending credibility. By presenting a realistic consequence (potential lawsuits), they aim to reframe the OP\u2019s dilemma in terms of broader societal issues.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The sentences are straightforward, aiming for clarity and ease of understanding.

It appeals to feelings of inclusivity and reminds the OP of the societal implications of their stance, possibly evoking guilt about wanting to exclude a disabled child.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** This response leverages moral appeals and emphasizes societal responsibilities. The use of the phrase \"tyranny of the majority\" positions the OP's beliefs against a larger social context, which can be powerful in reshaping perspectives.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** Structurally more complex, with a more abstract argument, this response may require the reader to engage more deeply with the text, potentially causing a disconnect if the reader isn\u2019t on the same wavelength.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** This response attempts to create a personal connection by considering the child\u2019s perspective, potentially making the OP reflect on their stance deeper.\n\n**Prediction:**\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factors:**\nThe second response effectively changes the framing of the situation from a mere disturbance to a critical discussion on societal inclusion and the rights of disabled individuals.

When there are leftovers from dinners with guests, etc. I'll eat that (throwing meat away is definitely worse than eating it). I try to do as much as I can for the environment and animals, I have very little money so I do not donate to animal rights organizations but I certainly would if I could.\n\nI'm trying to be as reasonable as possible on the subject, I try not to see individuals as evil 'cause they think it's normal to torture animals, I understand it's a cultural thing although I loathe humanity in general.\n\nI also think the hypothetical contribution of even a billion of the strictest vegans imaginable wouldn't change things a bit.\n\nAs of today I'm making this choice exclusively because it makes me feel good / at peace with myself, 'cause if I think about the contribution to the environment, I'm sorry but I just can't believe I'm doing anything significant.\n\nI'm 100% convinced on what I've done for a year now, and I'll become as \"vegan\" as possible in the future (I hate this whole \"vegan\" thing, it should be something natural like being against slavery), I'm NOT looking for an excuse to quit. But I know it'll only benefit my ethics and my self-esteem.\n\nI know that for every person like me (and I'm nowhere near good) there are one thousand who don't give a damn. I know that there are TENS OF BILLIONS animals being tortured for food, and unless the world miraculously turns vegan overnight, there's no chance any of this will change. Change my view.\n\nOn the eating leftovers thing, I also have to add.. I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...\n\nFor me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things? That restaurant probably threw away ten times what I could have eaten. It's depressing.\n\nI still recommend that people switch to a vegetarian (or vegan) lifestyle, I think it's a GOOD thing by all means. It's a fantastic feeling, it's healthy, and a million other things. As I said I haven't stopped believing in the lifestyle and I'll never quit. I just believe the actual contribution to the environment and the well being of animals is insignificant, and expecting results is hopeless.\n\n**I have found a convincing argument and I think that made me change my mind. Although many answers were backed up by very uplifting data, I couldn't justify changing my mind since I couldn't help but believe things are changing way too slowly, and that the damage might still be irreparable in the long run.**\n\n&gt; Eventually \u2014 not soon, but maybe in a generation or two \u2014 I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, changes will be sweeping and sudden.\n\nI have never thought about critical mass. I still believe the situation is a lot more complex than just the West, but even believing that one day a relatively sudden change could happen like it did with LGBT rights based on public opinion reaching critical mass makes me believe there's something to look for behind the hard numbers.\n\n**Another great argument with links**\n\n&gt; In short, the reality is: It adds up.  \n[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)  \n[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)  \nBoth of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds.

The growing number of people with vegetarian/vegan friends and family members also means that more people are being exposed to delicious vegetarian/vegan food and even learning how to cook it, all of which chips away at the all-too-common notion that any meal without meat isn't worth eating.\n\nHelping society at large reduce its meat consumption is really important because meat production has such an enormous environmental impact, especially with regard to climate change. The exact contribution of animal agriculture to climate change is disputed, but the most widely accepted statistics seem to put animal agriculture at about 15-25% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, with some estimates reaching as high as nearly 50%. While it certainly is possible to raise meat in a sustainable and environmentally healthy way, in practice 78% of beef, 95% of pork, and 99% of chicken is raised in factory farms, so getting people to eat less meat overall is very important. Even a 10% reduction in overall meat consumption could make a significant difference. According to the Earth Day Network, if everybody in the U.S. did not eat meat or cheese for just one day a week, it would be the equivalent of not driving 91 billion miles. (I'm not sure how that figure was calculated, but if it's even close to correct, it demonstrates the kind of difference skipping meat just three meals a week could make.)\n\nSecond Response: \nIn short, the reality is: It adds up.\n\n[Does Veganism Make a Difference?](http://www.animalliberationfront.com/Philosophy/Utilitarianism/Does%20Veganism%20Make%20a%20Difference.htm)\n\n[Expected Utility, Contributory Causation, and Vegetarianism](http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/thresholds.pdf)\n\nBoth of these essays approach your question in a statistics-based manner that focuses on thresholds.

And in my opinion, that's significant.\n\nThink of it this way: If the odds of you saving one animal are the same as the odds of you winning the lottery (say, one in 200 million), being a vegetarian is like entering that lottery a billion times.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses**:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - The **First Response** maintains an empathetic, optimistic tone.

We must clearly be able to see some of your features! I.e. mouth and nose/eyes and nose.

Kinda like 'I'm sharing how much of myself, now everyone feels entitled to my face too?'\n\n* As someone who wants to start enjoying the posts, it limits who is going to be posting which is disappointing. \n\n* If the point was to avoid 'floating dicks' everywhere, which makes more sense than the reasoning they give, then the amount of body shown should be the requirement. \n\nI don't think anyone should have to compromise their identity or do something many would be really uncomfortable with to be allowed to post on a subreddit.

What if only the men who are comfortable sharing their face share and everyone else is filtered out?  Those people then go elsewhere if they need to share their body.  In what way would that be invasive or sexist?\n\nAlso, I think it comes down to supply and demand.  In every dating site, I have heard female friends say that they receive pictures of guy's dicks.  Disembodied dicks have flooded the market and they are just not very much of an offering for a subreddit.  In contrast, women don't send pictures of themselves as often.  So /r/gonewild can be alluring without having the same demands.  \n\nYes, the sexes are treated differently, but I don't see how it is sexist.  The difference in treatment comes as a response from a contextual behavior, not as an oppression.  \n\nSecond Response: \nWhile it's detabley unnecessary or silly to require a face to post, the nature of any gonewild style subreddit make it incapable of being invasive and I would argue sexist as well.\n\nThe reason being that every submission in ladybonersgw (and indeed every subreddit), is just that, a submission. Men are presenting pictures of themselves because they are getting something out of the experience. No one can be required to show their face on the internet,  they can be required to show their face to meet the criteria of the subreddit *if they want to submit to it*.\n\nI'm going to use an exaggerated example to demonstrate the idea. Say we have a subreddit called r/sexyelbowsgw that is a community for hot young ladies to post pictures of their bare elbows. A requirement for submissions to that subreddit would probably include that at least one elbow be visible. This would likely not be challenged by anyone, because obviously, that's what that subreddit is for. People who like seeing elbows, and people interested in posting the sort of pictures that include elbows. The subreddit exists for people who want to see pics that meet that criteria, and those who are uncomfortable sharing their naked elbows with us would surely not post there. No one is requiring, or even asking them to, it's just that the sub exists for the kinds of pics that involve elbows.\n\nLadybonersgw isn't any different, it's just a community for people who like or want to post sexy pictures of men that include faces, instead of elbows.\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains a neutral and logical tone throughout, which helps to disarm potential defensiveness from the original poster. It acknowledges that while the rules may seem unnecessary, they aren't necessarily oppressive, emphasizing autonomy in the decision to share or not share one\u2019s face. The first response, while logical, comes off as slightly dismissive of the original poster's concerns about invasiveness.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response uses an analogy (the exaggerated example of a subreddit for \"sexy elbows\") that effectively clarifies the point being made. This kind of illustrative reasoning can resonate well with the original poster and help shift their perspective. The first response lacks this creative approach and instead relies more on challenging the assumptions of the poster directly.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response actively engages with the original poster\u2019s argument, explaining how the submission rules relate to the nature of the subreddit without belittling their concerns. It positions the rules within the context of choice and community standards. The first response, while engaging to an extent, could be interpreted as less supportive, focusing more on logic and the potential for misunderstanding rather than exploring the feelings behind the original poster's concerns.\n\nOverall, the more relatable analogy and supportive tone in the second response likely contributed to a greater potential for changing the original poster's view.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 181, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I think gifted kids should receive more attention than special needs children\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'd like to preface this by saying that parts of my post may sound like they're bragging, but they're not trying to come across that way. Also, I'm using a throwaway because I would not like my age to be associated with my main account. This is going to come across rant-like but I am very open to having my view changed. \n\n^^sorry ^^for ^^the ^^wall  ^^of ^^text\n\nHey,\n\nI'd just like to get this out of the way first, I'm technically \"gifted\" and I'm 13 years old (turning 14 in February). No, I'm not the type of kid to be \"I'm 12 years old but I'm *really* mature!!11\", I can be immature and most of time - at least at school - I do act immature. Also, when I say \"technically gifted\" I mean that I'm assigned a letter, which is P. Category P, at least in British Columbia where I live, stands for gifted. Also, I will be focusing on Canada throughout this post as it's where I live, specifically British Columbia but I'm sure the US and most other Canadian provinces are quite a bit like this.\n\nI was designated as gifted about 2 months ago although I had originally been tested in Grade 2 (Grade 7, going to 8 now) but they didn't give me the designation although they gave me high scores. I was tested again in Grade 6 and I still didn't receive the designation, not sure why they tested me that time, I was never told. The reason I just received the designation is because my district just gave out the funding to _test_ for gifted children. Yes, my school district just gave the funding to TEST for gifted children. Not to do anything with them. I was given to option to skip a grade when I went to get my results, which would mean going in to high school. After that meeting I was never contacted by the school psychologist (The person who did my test and gave me the results) again. Now, skipping a grade might sound fine and dandy but the negatives out weigh the positives. The biggest being the big impact on my social life. I'm not a very outgoing person and I might as well be the definition of awkward. So going to high school surrounded by a bunch of people a year older than me isn't going to be very pleasant. Now, say I wanted to get into a gifted program well, my district, and for a matter of fact, almost _all_ districts in British Columbia don't have a program for gifted children. There's a special school/program in Victoria and one in Vancouver. If you don't live in either of those cities, your screwed. \nAnyways, I'm getting off topic here, here is where I get a little angry.\n\nLast year in Grade 6 we had quite a few special needs children (Severely autistic, Down Syndrome, and some other stuff). These guys go to school and play all day. Of course, they can't participate in actual classes, but instead of actually doing stuff with these kids, they walk around the halls with them while they scream and interrupt classes. Every few kids get a helper, I'm not sure of the exact number but I think it's around 3 kids to a helper. But usually there are about 10 kids that are severely special needs so there are 3 or 4 helpers. These helpers stay with the kids at all times. This doesn't sound too bad, right? School pays for a couple extra teachers that help a few special needs kids. But then you hear about how they're treated. These kids regularly went on field trips, extravagant ones at that, sailing, those fancy indoors gymnasiums, to the airport to have a flight around the city (This one was weird, but they did it). Mean while, we had 25 - 30 kids to one teacher and I was bored out of my mind because I knew all the curriculum and the teachers were already stretched too thin to give any of the gifted kids special attention, hell, the teacher would sometimes ask me to go around and help the other kids because too many kids were confused with a new math concept or needed help writing their essays. So while these special needs kids got to go on special field trips and had many teachers to so few children, our teachers were struggling to help any kids who might fall behind and I was getting so bored I ended up skipping school to stay home and program or learn a language (Working on Latin right now). This year, the same thing happened, except it was worse. Instead of me just skipping school, I just stopped trying and my grades plummeted. School was so boring to me it's getting unbearable. The final nail in the coffin for me was my English teacher putting me in a low level reading group. I read at the 99th percentile. I just didn't even try anymore. I didn't even read the curriculum. The only reason I passed was because I did the bear minimum on worksheets and tests. Of course, I got excited when they tested me, only to find out that it wasn't going to change anything about 2 weeks later. I know another gifted kid a couple grades ahead of me (Going on grade 11 next year) who almost dropped out. This kid is a genius, I think he has an [FSIQ](http://www.special-learning.com/article/full_scale_intelligence_quotient_fsiq) of about 150. The only reason he stayed was because his parents pretty much forced him to. He used to just skip school. I don't talk to him much anymore so I don't know whats happening with him now, but he's a prime example of what happens when you don't treat gifted kids like gifted kids. Mean while, the special needs kids in his school get their own room, their own teachers, their own everything. Even with a smaller classroom the teachers don't give a flying fuck about you. And it's not just the special needs kids, it's the less intelligent kids that get special treatment. I don't want to call them stupid but that's what some of them are. They aren't special needs, they're just dumb (really don't want to sound rude but that's the best way to describe them). They get student teachers to help them, they get easier worksheets and for some reason, I'm still sitting there, doing worksheets that are far below my grade level. \n\n_____\n\nI haven't heard many arguments as to why I'm wrong since I'm not a fan of sharing this view since it kinda sounds like I'm hating on special needs people if I do. The one that I have been told is this:\n\n&gt;\"Gifted children are smart enough to be left on their own. So what if they get bored, so does every other kid! Special needs children simply can't do the work, they need to have their own helpers!\"\n\nOkay, that's fine, I recognize that special needs children can't do the work, and I'm absolutely fine with them getting their own teachers. What I'm not fine with is gifted children not getting any special attention. Every kid gets bored, but non gifted kids still learn stuff in school. I don't. That's how bad it gets. I don't learn stuff. I don't interact with kids I get so bored. I wouldn't say I get depressed but I do start feeling sad. It's a vicious cycle when I'm told I'm intelligent, then I get these terrible marks. Then I start hanging out with the wrong groups and my marks plummet more, on the days that I go to school I sit at the back of the classroom with the \"bad kids\" and listen to music, I don't pay attention to the teacher because I don't care what she's telling me, because I know it. This is were I sound very contradictory. I say that I know the curriculum but then I get bad marks. It's kind of a hard thing to explain, I guess I can try to explain it and it might sound like absolute bullshit but here it is:\n\nI stop trying because I get bored and when I get bored I rush through things or don't read things fully or think clearly. Instead of think through a test question and writing a well thought out answer, I write some absolute bullshit. Because it's fun. That's how bored I am. I _purposely fail tests_ because it's more _fun_ than learning the curriculum. I enjoy doing something like:\n&gt;What earths core composed of?\n&gt;&gt;Fairy dust and love\n\nYes, I gave that as an answer to a question on a science test. I actually wrote \"Fairy dust and love\" on a test because it gives me some sort of amusement, more than writing \"nickel and iron\" does. \n\nAnyways, back to the topic at hand. I know that special needs kids need their own special teachers. Just give the bloody gifted kids some too.\n\n&gt;But we don't have the funding!!!\n\nYep, that's also something I've heard. You wanna know what my schools most recent purchase was?\n\nYou're not going to believe this one...\n\nA mother fucking[ 1300 dollar drone](http://www.staples.ca/en/DJI-Phantom-2-Vision-Quadcopter-with-Integrated-FPV-Camcorder/product_1560844_2-CA_1_20001?kpid=1560844&amp;cid=PS:SBD:GS:n:n:SBD:58:21800&amp;kpid=1560844&amp;gclid=CjwKEAjwwZmsBRDOh7C6rKO8zkcSJABCusnbEFDFedFJiylb-l-oJH-JM9_EVrHBpewynENnfpD9QxoCIRLw_wcB).\n\nNot rented. \n\nThey literally bought a 1300 dollar drone. \n\nWhat for? Maybe it's a good purpose!\n\nNope. \n\nThey took a picture of the school with it. Instead of hiring a photographer to climb up on a ladder and take a picture of our entire school like every other school ever, they spent 1300 dollars on a drone to take 1 picture. To clarify I mean one of those pictures where your school huddles together outside and then gets a picture taken, I don't mean the school building.\n\nThis is kind of a bad example because a CEA (The kind of teacher who teaches special needs kids) salary is like 30 grand. But if we can pitch the idea of buying a drone to our funding guy, couldn't we pitch the idea of getting an extra teacher for the gifted kids?\n\nSo yeah, they probably can get the funding. It's that we're not the priority. The special needs kids are. The dumb kids are. The kids who excel? Fuck 'em, they can have fun in University. \n\nI guess I've conveyed my opinion as I see it.  Sorry if the post isn't incredibly clear, I get a little emotional about some of this stuff. Feel free to ask me any questions. I'm very open to any criticism. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nI agree that giving the brightest more chances is a good idea. In particular, shoving them into a class with 30-35 people of mixed abilities is a bad idea. There should be some kind of tiered education, especially for maths. I'm surprised that Canada does not do that. You can't teach the highest level of mathematics to the less able students, which is why in the UK they separate you off above the ages of 14.\n\nHowever, you are not as special as you think you are. In fact, probably labelling you as \"gifted\" has done more to damage your education than the lack of support for gifted children. It has made you think you are above your classmates and that school work is beneath you. It has made you stop trying. It has made you envious of what the special needs children have.\n\nI was told I was gifted too. I got sent on special events for gifted children. I realise now that it didn't mean anything.\n\nThe argument you dismissed is actually correct. Special needs children and stupid children get special attention because if they didn't they would:\n\n* disrupt lessons\n* become unproductive members of society\n* become a burden on society\n\nThey need the help to achieve what you could without effort. If you are indeed intelligent, then you don't need help. The really intelligent people do well even without trying. You should be getting straight As without much effort, because the information is just absorbed by you being there. If that isn't the case, then you aren't as intelligent as you think you are and you should put some effort in if you want to succeed.\n\nIntelligent people end up fine. It gives you so many little advantages that you take for granted and don't even realise. You'll read faster. You'll remember things easier and with less effort. You'll make better decisions. You'll handle your finances better. You'll find it easier to delay gratification. You'll find it easier to know how to eat healthier, and to do it. You'll find it easier to find a high paying job, and to perform well at it, and to get promotions. You'll find it easier to learn new things and adapt (even little things, that you don't notice).\n\nThe point is, you could be completely neglected, and still succeed, because you were gifted one of the greatest things: a sharp mind. If you want to throw that away because you're jealous that kids who are probably going to have a pretty shitty life are being raised up, then you will regret it.\n\nThe options for intelligent people tend to open up more in later years of schooling. You are 13. Up until now, you've probably been in the same lessons as everyone else. Over the next five years is when students begin to differentiate more, ultimately building to the most able going to the best universities, where they will have even more opportunities to excel and show themselves better than their peers. You don't need your hand holding to do this. Put the extra work in yourself. Learn. Expand your brain while it's still developing.\n\nAlso, just thought I'd point this out:\n\n&gt; Your not going to believe this one...\n\nIt should be **you're**.\n\nSecond Response: \nSo, a lot of answers are basically telling you to shut up and suck it up, or that it's your own fault that your grades aren't straight-A 100% everywhere. Great. Very helpful guys, thanks.\n\nThe more considerate ones that *didn't* twist around your words in their head are giving solid advice. The advice sucks, the world sucks, the whole situation sucks (you can tell I've been there), but a lot of the advice in this thread is legitimately worth trying. Why? Because it gives you a list of objectives to achieve (things to try), and you can gamify that list. Some of the stuff on the list is going to turn out more fun than you anticipated. \n\nThere's a lot I could say about what would be some of your best courses of action going forward, but I think that's better discussed in a different context and environment. If you want to talk about that, hit me up in PM. I've been there. \n\nNow, regarding this CMV. Long post ahead. In fact, I had to cut it up in multiple posts, because I hit the limit.\n\nThe topic, explicitly, says that you think gifted children should receive *more* attention *than* special needs children. Intuitively, this sounds true from an economy perspective: if two hours of attention per week boosts future productivity by 1%, wouldn't putting this on gifted children -- which have a higher base productivity rate, goes the assumption -- make much more economic sense than putting it on those who have the *lowest* base productivity rate? What gives? \n\nHowever, the numerical reality is much more interconnected with other aspects of our society. Normally, at this point (at least IME), things diverge into how things are too complex or complicated for you, or if you're so smart why don't you understand this already, or a bunch of things that are basically ways of not saying that they consider you unworthy of their time since you're just a child, and children just don't understand obvious things, that's what they do in life. \n\nYou could, yes, do all of the research and study and analysis yourself, but you've got tons and tons and tons of things like this that you want to devote time and energy to, and like everyone else you often fall prey to your own [akrasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia), or slam yourself against a perpetually insufficient amount of daily [mental energy](http://lifehacker.com/5798202/the-cognitive-cost-of-doing-things). That's why you came here, right? \n\nWith that long preamble out of the way, let's look at the details. The first thing that is considered (and, we'll see later, *with good reason*) is the process of **Identification**. The System (the interoperating amalgam of the influences of teachers on the field, numerical test results, general testing strategies, schedules, etc.) must first identify gifted students in order to do anything about them. Makes sense, and seems simple enough. Plug in the big picture: The System must routinely, collectively, as a cooperative force, accurately test and evaluate *hundreds of thousands* of children, one to three times per year, to grade them on dozens of different scales and classify them according to at least 16 completely different categories of nonstandard-ness (not sure how many types of special-needs students are recognized, but I see at least 13\u00a0[here](http://www.bctf.ca/uploadedfiles/public/publications/2012edfacts.pdf) and the letter \"P\" hints at more). And note that I've said *accurately*. A given test designed so that anyone with a score of over x on the test is found to be a \"gifted\" child might have a 50% detection rate and a 15% false positive rate. The real numbers here will depend on the specific method being evaluated, and are probably locked up in some office over at the ministry of education somewhere. \n\nGiftedness detection rate will be naturally lower than for other special needs, and/or have naturally larger false positive rates, because the easier detection methods are much more prone to confounding broader or deeper knowledge with giftedness, which leads to false trails caused by variation in prior learning performance, the family income effects, the \"expert immersion\" effects (if the child being tested has a renowned scientist as a parent, who takes a lot of time to teach them, they could very easily test as \"gifted\" even when they don't qualify on the less-quantified aspects), and so on. Hearing disabilities are easy to identify, and it's pretty hard to get false positives. Language barriers are a bit easier to get false positives for, but those are fairly quickly sorted out when they happen. Most abnormality on the \"deficient\" side of the spectrum quickly jumps out with minimal testing (and minimal identification *costs*) because, one way or another, something is blocking the well-oiled educational machine and these children are just falling off the conveyor belt. Ever heard a child fall off a conveyor belt? They're noisy as hell, all that crying and-- where were we?\n\nRight, so giftedness incurs a higher identification cost, and a lower detection accuracy for equivalent methods -- meaning either we're spending more money to get more accurate testing (or more redundancy), or we're spending money on gifted children but missing a bunch of them and also spending a ton of money on gifted education for children who aren't actually gifted. Granted, by the same conveyor belt logic, those non-gifted children will fall off the gifted track eventually and be caught cheaply and quickly -- but until then, that's extra funding and time and attention for them that wouldn't have been consumed had they stayed on the normal track. More costs! And we're still just in the Identification phase. [This paper](http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ746292.pdf) has the most data on this specific topic that I've ever seen in a single place, and expresses well most of the difficulties. \n\nNext up you need to look at teacher attention and the overall costs of actually providing a separate educational program for gifted children. Even if that just meant \"give them twice as much homework\", there would be administrative costs associated with all the tracking of the students, handling their extra program requirements, and all the other behind-the-scenes stuff that goes on. As a whole, these costs are fairly similar to each other from category to category, in terms of special need category. What little data I've seen on this is rather mixed, so absent evidence otherwise let's assume for now that keeping track of the gifted program costs about as much time and attention as keeping track of the language barriers program, alright?\n\nAfter that, you need to look at which kinds of programs to actually implement. This is a multivariable cost-benefit comparison. The cost of evaluating programs and field testing can be ignored relatively safely, as it's a one-off cost that pays for itself over the long term, presumably, and it's a cost that has also been paid many times over for evaluating programs for other tracks -- I'm sure that with the tools and experience we have today, it would cost a lot less time and funding to devise a good program than it did to come up with most of the special needs program currently in place today. \n\n1/2\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the tone and emotional approach of the second response.

{"index": 182, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If you are unattractive, it's largely your fault.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe only times where it's not your fault is if you are disfigured, or if you were born with extreme facial asymmetry. In both cases you cannot change those issues. If you have a nose that is 2 1/2 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. \n\nHowever, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. \n\nAre you overweight? Your fault. \n\nDo you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes?  Your fault. \n\nAre you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. \n\nDo you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. \n\nDo you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their \"comfortable\"? Your fault. \n\nDo you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you have no concept of fashion? Your fault. \n\nDo you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. \n\nLadies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. \n\nDo you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologne/perfume? Your fault. \n\nDo you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. \n\nMen, do you not shave your unibrow/nose hair? Your fault. \n\nNearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10/10 but if you are a 2/10, I firmly believe you can go to a 7/10. Everyone can be a 7/10 out of ten. Again, this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over. If you're a 4'10 male, it's not your fault, you just have shitty height genetics. \n\nAlso I am not saying being attractive is easy. It takes a lot of work and a lot of self improvement. \n\nFinally, this post isn't supposed to make anyone feel good. I am fully aware of how douchy it sounds. Spare me the hateful pm's.\n\nFirst Response: \nThis article will support your premise that few people if any are beyond looking attractive -- given the right treatments.http://www.themysteryworld.com/2012/04/there-are-no-ugly-women-only-poor-ones.html?m=1\n\nHowever, your stipulation that it's \"their fault\" if they are ugly is where you trip up. The experiment in the article provided these women with all the beauty treatments known to man, regardless of cost. Cost, and time, are important factors. Not everyone makes enough to afford the beauty treatments and fashionable clothing needed to make them at least a 7 out of 10. \n\nAre you arguing that it's their fault if they are poor, or just middle class? \n\nAlso, a lot of people are allergic to makeup -- I am. (And don't day there are hypoallergenic kind of makeup. That's more about marketing and much less about reality. And it's all expensive.) \n\nAnd flattering clothes are not cheap. Even if you can find them at thrift stores, it will take a long time. If you are raising children and working and perhaps caring for an elderly relative, you don't have time to comb through tons of items at Goodwill. \n\nIt might be a person's choice to take care of dependents rather than doll themselves up. But it's hardly their \"fault\" for not being able to look good without reneging on their responsibilities to others. \n\nYou're right that a large part of attractiveness is time and effort rather than genetics. But you are wrong to blame the people who don't have the time or money to make themselves attractive.\n\nSecond Response: \nA lot of those things you mentioned (acne treatment, fashionable clothes, hair treatment, gym membership to lose weight) require money. Since being poor isn't the poor person's fault (in most situations), I'd say being \"unattractive\" because you can't afford things that would make you \"attractive\" isn't your fault. You might say \"they should work harder, go to school, and get a better job,\" but I don't think their looks will be the first thing they spend their new salary on.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "### Analysis of the Responses:\n\n#### Tone and Emotional Approach:\n- **First Response**: The tone is more detailed and somewhat educational. It aims to engage with the original poster critically without becoming overly confrontational. The response includes personal anecdotes (allergies to makeup) which add a human element and empathy to the argument.\n- **Second Response**: The tone is more straightforward and assertive, making strong points quickly. It appears slightly dismissive of the original poster's arguments, focusing almost exclusively on the economic aspects without elaborating on personal experiences.\n\n#### Rhetorical Techniques:\n- **First Response**: Uses references to external sources (the article) to support its argument legally. It questions the reasoning of the original post by posing rhetorical questions about poverty and time constraints, guiding the original poster to reconsider their stance without outright denying it.\n- **Second Response**: Primarily relies on a concise appeal to logic about economic constraints, making it less nuanced. It doesn't engage deeply with the original poster\u2019s individual points but effectively highlights the flaw in the responsibility argument regarding poor financial circumstances.\n\n#### Sentence Structure and Readability:\n- **First Response**: Contains relatively long sentences with multiple clauses, which may engage readers who prefer a more in-depth argument. The complexity could require more focus to read, but it may also appeal to those looking for a comprehensive rebuttal.\n- **Second Response**: Consists of shorter, punchy sentences that are easily digestible. This brevity makes the point clear quickly, which could resonate better with readers favoring straightforward arguments.\n\n#### Engagement with Original Poster:\n- **First Response**: Engages with the original poster's personal beliefs critically while also asserting its own views, allowing for a conversational tone that can make the discussion feel more collaborative.\n- **Second Response**: Engages with the overall argument more superficially, challenging the premises without as much exploration of alternative views or deeper connections to the original poster's point.\n\n### Prediction:\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n### Key Factors: \nThe first response successfully changes the original poster's view because it engages more deeply with the premises of the original post. By introducing the concept of economic constraints and providing personal experiences, it invites the original poster to rethink the idea of fault in attractiveness based on income and available resources. The rhetorical questions prompt more reflection than the straightforward assertions in the second response, making it more likely to lead to a shift in perspective.", "is_correct": true}

Most are just in a bad slump and in a irrational and emotional state of mind and that state of mind is never a good state to make big decisions in. A lot of times all these people need is a bit of an obstacle to suicide to make them think about what they're doing, and very often they reconsider. \n\n\nSo while heightened rails won't stop the ones really determined to die, it will stop a great number who not in the right mental condition to decide whether they should live or die.\n\nSecond Response: \nWhen people jump off bridges, apparently the most common thought whilst falling amongst those people who miraculously survived is 'I've made a terrible mistake.' When people are suicidal they often aren't thinking very straight. They may be making decisions that they will very shortly regret. Raising the rails on the bridge wont prevent everyone from killing themselves; it will make it significantly harder however. If you want to kill yourself then you will as you point out still do it, but many of those people aren't in that sort of mind frame, and doing something as simple as this can help to prevent people making bad decisions. Its the same reason many pill bottles have caps that have to be turned in very specific ways in order to open, if you are in a frantic mood or not in a fit state of mind opening the cap isn't easy to accomplish, and I absolutely believe that if you do want to commit suicide then you should be in a fit state of mind when doing so. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "### Comparison of Responses\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is somewhat factual, leaning towards a rational argument. It presents the idea that many people contemplating suicide are likely in an irrational emotional state, suggesting that heightening the barriers may serve as intervention. The emotional appeal, however, is minimal.\n   - **Second Response:** The tone here is more empathetic and compassionate, recognizing the complexities of mental health. It acknowledges the common experience of regret among those who survive such attempts, which may elicit a stronger emotional response from the original poster.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**\n   - **First Response:** It uses a logical progression of ideas, emphasizing the need for an obstacle to interrupt irrational decision-making. The argument lacks rhetorical flourishes or emotive language, focusing instead on the pragmatic aspects of suicide prevention.\n   - **Second Response:** This response employs a personal anecdote regarding the thoughts of those who've jumped and survived, which can resonate emotionally and emphasize the gravity of the situation. It also utilizes an analogy about pill bottles to illustrate the importance of creating barriers against impulsive actions.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**\n   - **First Response:** The sentence structure is relatively straightforward but employs complex phrases that may slightly hinder readability. The argument is clear but could be more engaging.\n   - **Second Response:** The sentences here are more varied in structure and flow comfortably, making the argument easy to follow. The empathetic language enhances engagement, resulting in a more relatable tone.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**\n   - **First Response:** The engagement is somewhat limited, as it focuses more on presenting a counter-argument without directly addressing the emotional aspects of the original poster's viewpoint.\n   - **Second Response:** This response directly addresses the emotions and regrets associated with suicidal thoughts, which is likely to resonate more with the original poster, suggesting an understanding of their perspective while still advocating for a change.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Prediction\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the emotional engagement and empathetic tone of the second response. It effectively connects with the original poster\u2019s feelings towards suicide by acknowledging the potential for regret among those who survive. This emotional resonance, combined with relatable analogies and an understanding of the irrational mindset during such moments, is likely more impactful in influencing the original poster's views compared to the more logical and detached argument presented in the first response.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 184, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Government officials have very little control over economic growth and political candidates are either bluffing or stupid when they say they will \"grow the economy.\"\n\nOriginal Post: \nThere are a few things presidents, congressional representatives  and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians. Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low. New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements. Investor confidence helps, a little, maybe, sometimes, but the U.S. stock market is already overpriced. Beyond that, most economic growth comes from increases in productivity, and consumer confidence. Elected officials have no control over these.\n\nIf you vote for a candidate who promises to \"create jobs\" or \"grow the economy,\" you're either voting for a liar or a fool. Change my view!\n\nEdit: I'm speaking of the U.S. economy, not the global economy, and I'm speaking of political candidates who might run for office in the near future, not the distant future or the past.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

If you're elected Prime Minister of a very poor country, there are probably quite a lot of policy levers you can pull to massively improve your economy.  Deng Xiaoping made policy changes (a massive liberalization and reversal of Mao-era collectivism) that massively improved the economy of China.\n\nNow, the US is much closer to the frontier of what's possible than China was in the 1970s, so there may not be as many gains to be had.  However, there is a potential policy out there that's big enough to make a sea change: open borders.\n\n[This paper](http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.3.83) makes a pretty persuasive case that opening the borders of western countries to all migrants would **double world GDP.**  That's huge economic growth.  If a candidate says they're going to massively improve the US economy, and open borders are in their platform, they're not necessarily full of shit.\n\nSecond Response: \nIn 1999, Bill Clinton and the Congress repealed the Glass-Steagall Act. This may have not caused the 2008 Global Financial Crisis all on its own, but it made sure that *everybody* got hurt because it allowed banks to combine personal savings and risky investments. \n\nBecause of the repeal of the GSA, the 2008 crash cost up to [$14 trillion](http://www.dallasfed.org/research/eclett/2013/el1307.cfm).\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response succeeds in changing the original poster\u2019s view primarily through its constructive engagement and broader context. It introduces a specific and impactful example (Deng Xiaoping's policies in China) that frames the discussion in a comparative context of different economies. By suggesting a concrete policy (open borders) that could lead to significant economic growth, the response not only counters the original poster's claim but also presents a plausible exception to their assertion about government officials having little control over economic outcomes. The tone is more optimistic and open to discussion, which can foster a more receptive mindset in the original poster.\n\nIn contrast, the second response, while informative, does not deeply engage with the original post\u2019s core arguments regarding the role of elected officials in economic growth. The focus on the Glass-Steagall Act is somewhat disconnected from the broader claim that political candidates lack control or credibility, making it less effective in persuading the original author. The response is also more critical, lacking a tone of collaboration or openness that is essential in changing someone\u2019s viewpoint.\n\nOverall, the key factors leading to this prediction include the first response's use of analogy, introduction of a specific policy with potential for significant impact, and more balanced, constructive tone that invites further discussion.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 185, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Parents should be allowed to have children with severe mental disability euthanized\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis CMV post is partly inspired by this r/relationships [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3e4h7z/i_m38_want_to_surrender_our_severely_autistic_son/) I came across earlier today. This is also a topic I feel somewhat strongly about and I have not had a chance to really share my view on because it's sort of a \"taboo\" view to have.\n\nTo sum up the r/relationships post: OP's 4 year old son is severely autistic and OP has been told by doctors that his son will never function above the level of a 1 year old and will require constant care. Son is ruining OP's life and marriage, and is negatively affecting OP's 2 young daughters as well.\n\nI do not believe the OP of that post, and the many other parents who are in a similar scenario, deserve to have their lives ruined just because they were \"dealt a bad hand\" and ended up with a disabled child. I think that euthanasia is a humane, simple solution to a problem like this. After all, we euthanize our loved cats and dogs that are no longer able to have a good, independent life. I don't see a fundamental difference between the two cases.\n\nAs for government-owned care facilities: I don't believe it is a good use of our resources as a society to continue to take care of individuals who have no chance to ever become functional members of society. Euthanasia is a much more economically and environmentally more efficient option.\n\nWhat won't change my view: slippery slope/\"where do we draw the line\" types of arguments. We are only discussing cases in which the child is beyond a shadow of a doubt unable to ever function independently. CMV.\n\nEdit: I'm deeply sorry if I offended anybody, particularly those with autism/other disabilities, with this post. Please understand that I am not suggesting that anyone with autism be euthanized. My argument only applied to those who were not capable of basically doing anything besides eating, sleeping, and using the bathroom (with assistance). Anyone who is reading this post is FAR from even close to the level I'm talking about. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Children are not their parents' possessions. A parent raising a child in their custody has a lot of control over that child, but they do not own them.  They therefore do not have the right to terminate them.  They can, however, give up their rights and responsibilities as a parent and surrender the child to adoptive parents, an organization, or the state.\n\n2. 5 year olds may not be able to take care of themselves, but they still have inner selves, personalities, hopes and wants and fears.  The same goes for those with conditions like severe autism. That has value, even if they cannot live independently.\n\n3. You cannot predict the future.  Some treatment may arise that drastically changes their ability to function. Schizophrenics can be greatly helped by medication today, maybe severely autistic people will be helped in 10 years.  Further, it is difficult to tell which autistic children will be able to gain some measure of independence later in life (see [here](http://www.autism-help.org/autism-prognosis-long-term.htm) for example).  Severity of symptoms as a child is far from a perfect predictor.\n\nI'll leave you with this story of a particular child with autism that I heard about on radiolab. Here's an [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/magazine/reaching-my-autistic-son-through-disney.html?_r=0) about it, but if you've got the time I'd highly recommend the [radiolab podcast](http://www.radiolab.org/story/juicervose/) itself.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think the central issue with this type of view is the idea that the life a severely disabled person has is not \"good.\" Certainly it is not \"independent,\" but who is to say it is not \"good?\" We don't know whether severely autistic people are generally happy or miserable--often they do not express happiness the way neurotypical people do but may report experiencing it. After all, autism is a communication disorder. We can't really \"share the experiences\" of someone with severe autism. And, of course, there are many other disabilities where we encounter the same question. We've no way to know whether they are enjoying themselves and their lives, because we can't ask in a way they understand and they can't tell us.\n\nNow, I'm not talking about people with devastating, painful medical conditions who CAN tell us how they feel. I believe in assisted suicide for the terminally ill and greatly suffering. But I don't think we can reasonably extend that to someone who by definition cannot tell us if they are suffering or not.\n\nEdit: You also mention the negative impact a child with a severe disability has on the family. While this is very sad, if it wouldn't be grounds for euthanizing any other child, why are disabled children different? What I mean is, if my family were suffering greatly because we could not afford to feed a child, say, or because we were overburdened by regular childcare needs, would we be able to euthanize the child? If not, why not, if effect on others matters? I'm not trying to make a slippery slope argument, I'm asking why a negative impact from a disabled child is different from a negative impact of a non-disabled child--which, depending on circumstance, could be equal or lesser.\n\nEdit2: If you've come to tell me I don't know anything about taking care of disabled people, save it. I worked in a care facility and my brothers are autistic. I guess it isn't clear: my alternative plan to OP's euthanasia is not \"parents should suck it up,\" it's \"we should have a social safety net for this type of situation, including in and out of home care for these families, because that's what social safety nets are for.\" There is no need to tell me that these families suffer because it is impossible to provide round the clock care--that is obvious to me.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "## Comparison of Responses\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response:** This response takes a more logical and direct approach. It emphasizes the idea of children's inherent value and the responsibility parents have toward them. The tone is assertive but also somewhat compassionate, as it acknowledges the challenges faced by parents while arguing against the notion of euthanasia.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is contemplative and empathetic, focusing on the subjective experience of those with disabilities. It challenges the notion of a \"good\" life being equated solely with independence. The emotional appeal here is more prominent, as it emphasizes the unknown experiences of individuals with severe disabilities.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response:** Utilizes a logical progression of arguments, backing its points with the suggestion of future medical advancements and narratives. It also uses personal testimonies (a story about a child with autism) to illustrate that individuals with disabilities can have valuable inner experiences.\n- **Second Response:** Employs rhetorical questions to encourage the original poster to reflect on the nuances of their argument. It distinguishes between different types of suffering and illustrates a broader ethical concern about life quality. This allows for a deeper discussion about the implications of euthanasia.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response:** Its structure is straightforward, using numbered points for clarity. The readability is high, making it accessible to readers without overwhelming them with information. Each point builds clearly on the last.\n- **Second Response:** Contains longer, more complex sentences that convey deeper thoughts, but may require more concentration from the reader. It has a conversational flow, making it engaging but potentially less immediately clear for those seeking succinct arguments.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response:** Engages the original poster by addressing their points directly, but may come off as somewhat formulaic with its point-by-point breakdown. While it does try to explain the value of life with challenges, it doesn\u2019t fully delve into the emotional context.\n- **Second Response:** Directly engages with the original poster's points while also expanding the conversation to include the experiences of marginalized voices. By sharing personal experience, it invites the original poster and others to consider social support as a viable solution.\n\n## Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Key Factors Leading to Prediction\nThe second response more successfully engages with the emotional and ethical dimensions of the issue raised in the original post. It challenges the premise that life quality equates strictly to independence and introduces a broader reflection on suffering and happiness in a way that is likely to resonate with the original poster. The use of introspective questions and the appeal to personal experience and societal responsibility may provoke thoughtful reconsideration of the original stance, making it more effective than the first response.", "is_correct": true}

This is the same thing; most of the time, we aren't hunting because we need to, we're hunting because we want to. \n\nWhat this selective outrage over Cecil tells me is that we, as a society, simply don't have any unified logic towards how we are supposed to treat animals and instead attach our moral views of animal treatment to whatever our culture finds fashionable. Walter James Palmer is potentially going to face criminal charges while Tyson and Perdue make an industry out of their treatment of animals.

We don't eat endangered animals. This lion was in a wild life reservation, lured out, and then killed. There was little hunting going on, since the lion wore a GPS.\n\nWhen animals go extinct the natural cycle breaks down, and we as humans will know the effects.

Absolutely changed their genres irrevocably in addition to the general culture; (possibly) even more than their popularity might suggest.\n\nBeyonce as an example would NOT fit this bill. There simply isn't anything \"new\" to her act.

There are two reasons I chose this cutoff date. The first is the emergence of MP3's and the second is 9/11/2001. But I didn't want to draw attention to those ideas although a couple people did note that the former may have been the reason for the dearth of any \"big game changers\". \n\nEdit 3: I recognize that Marley and The Pistols are not American bands.

But to combine the two best selling genres into one act... again... isn't a change. Kanye is good at what he does. No doubt. But what does he have beyond simply selling records? Simply having a unique flow is completely normal in hip hop. What *change* has he made to the overall musical or cultural conversation?

Not to mention he was basically the first and only one to successfully combine punk and blues on a massive scale with songs like seven nation army and icky thump.\n\nThe Black Keys would have never become popular if not for the white stripes, who reminded people a 2 person band can work on a radio format. They then took the blues formula and brought back 70s soul, R&amp;B and delta blues influence into the \"rock single\" of modern day.\n\nThe strokes did something very similar with garage rock in NYC in the early 00s. They came on the scene when alternative, pop-punk and arena rock dominated the rock charts and turned it on its head. \"Is this it\" changed the direction of rock music and showed that you didn't need to be U2 or Blink 182 to sell records.\n\nAnd that's just blues and garage rock. Not to mention what the Foo Fighters did with modern rock, what QOTSA did with stoner rock, or John Mayer did with texas blues-rock with the john mayer trio. That's all just in the world of rock music; ignoring pop, EDM, hip-hop, jazz and soul.\n\nSecond Response: \nEminem?\n\nI know he technically broke out just before the new millenium, but my how the \"game has changed\".\n\nBeing white in the rap genre was a barrier he destroyed. Bringing hip-hop so far into the mainstream it has basically become pop music. Brought his icon of a persona to the silver screen with an award winning soundtrack in tow. All of this happened within the first decade of his career. I think it's safe to say he's had an enormous impact on music as a whole throughout the world. \n\nIconic within genre and abroad? Check\n\nChanged genres? Marketing? Style? Triple check.\n\nWe will look back on today's current music and remember Eminem for everything he's done. Beyond that, I think the oversaturation of the music industry that has been caused by the dawn of the internet age is the main cause of the many one hit wonders, short attention span, single-serve artists that we hear nowadays. That, along with the fact that most of the broad, accessible genres have \"all been done before\", so the innovation comes in smaller amounts and in subgenres that aren't going to have the major cultural impact that the artists of yesteryear had. I think it's a \"pre-internet vs post-internet\" battle that you are referencing in your search for finding those impactful artists. They exist, but it's impossible to stand out as much as the artists you've mentioned were able to due to their place in time and the technology that exists now.\n\nWhile I think he is the obvious answer to your question I'll throw out some other names that might work for ya...\n\nTaylor Swift (made country popular)\n\nKid Rock (turned country, rock, and hip-hop into pop)\n\nBlink-182/Green Day (started in the 90's, blew up in the 00's, making pop-punk popular)\n\nSystem of a Down/Slipknot (made heavy metal popular)\n\nLinkin Park (meshed rock and hip-hop and made it popular)\n\nThe White Stripes/The Strokes/Interpol (turned indie rock into an incredibly marketable genre)\n\nSkrillex and Deadmau5 (will be remembered as some of the first to bring house, techno, and dubstep into the mainstream)\n\nBright Eyes/Death Cab/Modest Mouse (more underground success, but took some good old roots americana, added some emo, incredible song-writing and developed a cult following)\n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more engaging and conversational tone, introducing a relatable context regarding Eminem's influence. It acknowledges the original poster's criteria and directly addresses their points. This tone likely resonates more positively with the original poster, creating an opening for them to reconsider their viewpoint.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second responder effectively uses counterpoints to explain the cultural impact of Eminem and acknowledges the complexities of the current music scene due to technological changes. This type of argumentation helps draw connections that could successfully sway the original poster, especially in their search for transformative figures in music.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response acknowledges the original poster's perspective and criteria directly, stating that Eminem checks all the boxes laid out in the original post. This level of interaction likely makes the original poster feel heard and respected, fostering a more open mindset toward changing their view.\n\nIn contrast, the first response makes solid points about bands and their revitalizing effect on genres, but it feels more like a list of arguments rather than a conversation.

I personally could empathize more, but perhaps it's not just the days but also considering the age of someone as they're getting out, how much of their lives was taken, and how different a person they might be.*\n____\nInspired a little bit from responding to [this post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/37131i/cmv_when_captured_and_convicted_swat_pranksters/), I think as a society we should really start thinking of imprisonment and announcing sentences in terms of days, not years. In terms of using sentences as a means of discouraging crime, the number 5 sounds small, but 5 years is actually 1826 days (including a leap year), which is a massive number. When you start talking about locking someone away for decades, and you realize actually the thousands and thousands of days you're taking away from person, and if that punishment really does match the severity of the crime... I don't think people actually have the capacity to imagine being sat in a small barred room day after day for that long. They just hear 7 years and think \"Oh it's only 7\", and fail to recognize just how much of someone's life is actually being taken away. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

People support harsh prison sentences because they don't feel empathy for the perpetrator of the crime, not because they don't grasp the magnitude of the punishment. \n\nSecond Response: \nPeople will probably just become desensitized to the numbers. A long time ago $1000 was a huge sum of money, a year's salary even. Now, that is considered a relatively small amount of money to earn. The numbers only have meaning because we give them meaning.\n\nNumbers in the thousands are too big for us to really feel and conceptualize. We will detach ourselves because it is impossible to imagine a thousand days of suffering all at once. Thus we will begin the desensitization process and this will probably end up having little effect on sentences. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Analyzing the two responses reveals distinct stylistic elements that suggest which response may have changed the original poster's (OP's) view.\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** maintains a more assertive tone, stating that people have an \"intuitive sense\" of time, which implies a critique of the OP's argument. It emphasizes a lack of empathy as a key reason for accepting prison sentences.\n- The **Second Response** takes a more reflective and philosophical tone. It uses a relatable analogy about money to connect with the OP, suggesting that societal perception diminishes the impact of numerical values. This might evoke more empathy and contemplation from the OP.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- The **First Response** uses straightforward logical reasoning, implying that understanding the duration of sentences is less about the units of time and more about empathizing with the criminal's situation. It strikes a confrontational note.\n- The **Second Response**, however, employs analogies to make a broader societal observation about desensitization to numbers. It invites the OP to consider a larger trend, which can be seen as more engaging rather than dismissive.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- Both responses are relatively easy to read, but the **Second Response** uses varied sentence lengths and structure, which may make it more enjoyable to read. It combines complex and simple sentences, which can help maintain the reader's interest.\n- In contrast, the **First Response** is more direct and less nuanced, which, while clear, may not engage the OP as effectively.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- The **First Response** directly challenges the OP's viewpoint but does not invite further contemplation or discussion.\n- The **Second Response** resonates more with the OP's invocation of empathy and perspective on time, encouraging a shared consideration of societal values and emotional connections with numbers.\n\n**Prediction:** \n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factor(s) Leading to Prediction:**\nThe emotional and reflective nature of the Second Response likely resonated more with the OP's expressed values regarding empathy and understanding.

{"index": 190, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: 'Historical' films that are 'based on a true story' should be strictly monitored for accuracy, if not outright banned.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI just watched *The Imitation Game* (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it ... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy). I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) \"the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film ... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing\". This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character.\n\nSometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching *13 Days* (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the 'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was *actually there* argues that \"For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever ... that's absurd.\" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified.\n\nThus, **I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.**\n\nI will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance:\n\n* \"They're claiming to be *based* on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate.\" \n\nYes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films *appear* as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.\n\n* \"The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.\"\n\nBut to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows *absolutely nothing* about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching *JFK* (1991). And you know what, they *should* feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.\n\n* \"It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.\"\n\nSuck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch *Pearl Harbour* (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film: 'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, \"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nOkay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on *Pocahontas* (1995) and *Argo* (2012)) - please CMV!\n\n**EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments.

So since it's a movie and they're telling you outright it's a dramatization then there's no reason to go through the song and dance of verifying it as 100% factual.  Things that are 100% factual would be a documentary, which these movies are not advertised as.\n\n&gt; Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth'\n\nBut the tagline isn't \"based on truth\", the tagline is \"based on a true *story*\".  Of which, the original story may or may not even be 100% factual on what actually happened.  People exaggerate and mislead in their recounting of events all the time.  So I would have to say that calling something \"based on a true story\" is a level removed in facts than saying \"based on truth\".  The story is just a sequence of events that happened at some point in time, not down to the detail what actually happened.\n\n&gt; And you know what, they should feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.\n\nIs there an inherent problem with getting some facts wrong or leaving them out?  Since it's a movie do you expect people going to see these films are going there to be educated or are going to just be entertained?  If they're going to be entertained then why are you worried about the factualness of the story?\n\n&gt; Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch Pearl Harbour (2001).\n\nWhat if I don't want to watch a Sci-Fi action film?  What if I want to watch Saving Private Ryan -esque movies that aren't documentaries?  Things like Black Hawk Down, Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, and other war movies/shows tend to be based on something so why do I only have the choice between a History Channel special on WWII or nothing at all?  Because to be completely honest, I would imagine a 100% factual movie about WWII would have either a *lot* of people just sitting around waiting for stuff to happen or would just be a hogepodge of battle scenes that don't really make a story.\n\nI'm curious if you also hold the same standards for science.  Do you get really angry at space movies that fly things like planes and have fire or sound while people are floating around in the void?  I could go on about all the things those movies get wrong.  And I think that's a bit more grievous considering they actually *break physics*.  But in the end, it's entertainment.  If I wanted facts I'll go watch a documentary.\n\nSecond Response: \nI sympathize with your frustrations, but I'm not sure I agree we need to start banning movies. A few points:\n\n\n\n&gt; It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.\n\nActually, it really should. In any capacity. We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the \"true story\", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.\n\n\n\n&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).\n\nHow someone interprets the word \"based\" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.\n\n\n\n&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.\n\nWhile it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of \"documentary\" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  \n\n\n\n&gt;\"We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson\".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?\n\nBecause people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. \n\n\n\n\nI'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "When comparing the two responses to the original post, several stylistic and rhetorical elements emerge that can help determine which response is more effective in changing the original poster's view.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach:\n- **First Response:** The tone is somewhat dismissive, using phrases like \"song and dance\" and downplaying the significance of accuracy in historical films. It appears more confrontational and appears to challenge the original poster's emotional connection to the films.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is more understanding and sympathetic, directly acknowledging the original poster's frustrations, yet presenting differing perspectives in a thoughtful manner.

However, it lacks depth in its arguments and tends to imply that entertainment should outweigh historical fidelity.\n- **Second Response:** This response employs logical reasoning and examples to argue against the need for regulation of films. It claims that it's the audience's responsibility to seek out truth rather than relying solely on dramatizations. It also compares historical films with documentaries to highlight the potential biases in both formats, making a nuanced point that appeals to the original poster's sense of discernment.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability:\n- **First Response:** Offers a more disjointed structure with somewhat casual phrasings that could be perceived as lacking formality.

{"index": 191, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Rappers don't have any real talent.\n\nOriginal Post: \n     Rappers are not talented. They do what anyone can do. Anyone is capable over saying words over a beat. Some rappers don't even try to make sense, or be clever. I can't believe rappers are allowed to win grammies and different music awards. Poets should be allowed to win grammies too then. Rap to me is like in the same category as a terrible singer sometimes. \n\n     Every person on this earth that can speak is capable of rapping. You can't say the same for singers, that can sing on key. You might say, it takes skill to rap well. No it doesn't. It takes time, and a pen and paper. It can be mastered relatively easy. Please show me why they deserve to be respected as musicians.\n\nEdit 1: Okay u/scottevil110 pointed out to me, performing, or the entertainment value is a big part of a rappers act. It takes tremendous confidence and talent to get on stage and move a crowd with your lyrics. Some rappers are capable of this so, i changed my view that some have talent in that regard, but as far as the actual rapping i still believe that i could truthfully be the next Meek, or Young Thug.\n\nEdit 2: Let me clarify what talent is to me. I already know what the webster definition is, the natural ability or aptitude to do something. Let's take young thug as an example and Lamarr. They're both rappers and make good music i like. Everyone who can talk has the ability to come up with the words young thug says, and say it like him in a drunken stupor. So everyone is talented then in some way. Lamar it would take longer, and he has a nice flow, but still it could be easily copied. Now, REAL talent to me, is a perormance like Keyshia Cole singing [Love](  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KTkW636B8xg) one of the greatest songs of all time. Or Peter Green ripping the shit out of a guitar, in songs like, need your love so bad, or [the supernatural](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YoasUjXBkm8_____). That's REAL talent, compared to something like [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RAzzv6Ks9nc). REAL talent is something that not your average jor could do. Some are born with it. For some it takes years to become good at it, but it has to have a level of difficulty, in my view, that the average person can't easily attain.\n\nEdit 3: u/glory2hypnotoad showed me writing a full length album on Eminems level does take i guess some real skill. So there are a few rappers who have some real talent. But generally they are untalented. However every singer that can sing on key is talented to me. It's just in a whole 'nother caliber of music to me, for the simple reason it's next to impossible to attain. Comparing Eminem to any singer that can sing on key, is like comparing Iman Shumpert to Lebron James.\n\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Having good flow isn't something just anyone can do, it takes practice. \n\nRappers who make their own beats have an additional level of talent as well. Again, beat making isn't as easy as you'd think it would be if you actually tried it. \n\nIf you're good at both of these things naturally with little practice then congratulations, you're a talented rapper, but it doesn't give you the right to look down on the genre because of something that comes naturally to you.\n\nSecond Response: \nThat's like saying that writing a good book doesn't take skill, just time and a pen and paper. A casual look through any publisher's slush pile will show you that the results of time and a pen and paper are disastrous most of the time without skill.

The use of the word \"should\" introduces an imperative quality, suggesting a level of frustration with the original poster's lack of firsthand experience.\n  \n- **Second Response**: The tone is more subtle and intellectual, employing metaphors to explain the complexity of lyricism and comparing it directly to writing a book. This approach seeks to engage the original poster's reasoning rather than confront them directly, which might be perceived as more persuasive.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response**: The main rhetorical techniques are based on personal challenge ('try rapping') and an appeal to personal experience (acknowledgment of practice required for good flow and beat-making). The response appears to rely on a simple challenge to authority: unless you've done it, you can't criticize it.\n  \n- **Second Response**: This response utilizes analogy (comparing songwriting to book writing) effectively, emphasizing that both require skills that are not easily mastered just through time and effort alone. It also uses a common saying to resonate with the audience and lend credibility to the argument.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response**: The sentence structure is straightforward, with short, punchy sentences that contribute to a sense of urgency and directness. However, it might risk being seen as slightly simplistic.\n  \n- **Second Response**: This response features more complex and varied sentence structures, which can make it intellectually stimulating.

{"index": 192, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Bernie Sanders, an independent, shouldn't be allowed to run as leader of the Democratic Party\n\nOriginal Post: \nI like Bernie, love his politics in fact. I doubt there is a politician I agree more with.  I like the fact that, unlike most politicians, his rhetoric matches his actions. Whether it's filibustering Bush's tax cut extensions, standing up against Citizens United or proposing amendments to the Patriotic Act, this is a guy who's politics match mine.\n\nThat being said, I find it problematic for a guy who's never sat as a Democrat and doesn't caucus as a Democrat to be running to be their leader. \n\nCMV Reddit, you can do it.\n\nEDIT: Far too many of these arguments are based on how folk view either Clinton or Sanders, which to me is inconsequential. The crux of the issue is whether or not an independent should be allowed to run under the party ticket.\n\n\n\nFirst Response: \nFYI, Sanders actually does caucus *with* the Democrats, just not as one.  Technicality, I know, but he's not alien to the party.\n\nSanders is running as a Democrat, which is to say that he is a Presidential candidate seeking the backing of the Democratic party as he believes his ideals align with the party's platform (which they overwhelmingly do) and that democrats should vote for him.  If democratic voters agree, and elect him in the primaries, the Democratic party will endorse him as the candidate that they support for the primary election.  Anyone can run as a candidate for either party, regardless of past affiliation- it's about where you stand on the issues now.  There have been more than a few politicians who have switched parties entirely, some successfully (though none that I'm aware of were for President).\n\nSanders is running as a Democrat to capture the support and resources of a huge party and its voters so he has a better shot of being President.  As much as I'm sure we'd all love it, being elected as an Independent is simply not possible in 2016.\n\nSecond Response: \nIf the Democratic party decides to nominate him, it is their choice, not his. Although a candidate could decline a nomination, it's uncommon unless the \"third party\" in question is going to damage their standing with their base because it's a Neo-Nazi party or something. \n\nMost major candidates will be endorsed by multiple parties. A Republican might also be endorsed by the Conservative party a registered Democrat endorsed by the Green party etc.. \n\nIf both the Republican party and the Democratic party wanted to nominate the same individual technically they could do it.  \n\nThe President isn't the actual \"leader\" of their respective political parties. But the figurehead or mascot for all practical purposes. They don't set policy, they don't get to dictate the party platform (although they will likely have input). \n\nSo if Bernie Sanders gets the \"nod\" from the Dems.. it's not that he's going to be running as a Democrat, the Dems are going to be running as Sandersites. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response maintains a more constructive and informative tone, which likely appeals to the original poster's expressed admiration for Bernie Sanders while addressing their concerns about his affiliation. This tone fosters a more open-minded dialogue. In contrast, the second response is more defensive and emphasizes the technicalities of candidate endorsements, which could alienate the original poster.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response effectively uses clarification and logical argumentation to dismantle the original poster's point about party affiliation, highlighting the actual relationship Sanders has with the Democratic Party. This direct engagement with the poster's points helps change their mind more effectively. The second response makes valid points about nominations but lacks the clarity and relevance that would directly address the original poster's concerns.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response is more concise and straightforward, which enhances readability and enables the original poster to grasp the points more readily. The second response, while informative, is longer and more complex, potentially increasing the cognitive load on the reader.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response acknowledges the original poster's perspective but provides a compelling reason why their concern may not be valid, thus directly engaging with their argument. The second response, although it presents relevant information, does not engage as empathetically or directly with the original poster's expressed views.\n\nOverall, these factors indicate that the first response provides a more effective argument for changing the original poster's view on Sanders' candidacy under the Democratic banner.", "is_correct": true}

It seems unfair that the SAT would include this in the math section. Some will argue that it makes sure students are \"well rounded,\" but it's incredibly unfair to use this to test a student's aptitude for college. When I was in high school, I had an 89% overall GPA. I got mid-range scores on the reading and writing sections of the SAT, but did very poorly on the math section. Because of this, I was denied admission to many colleges which I applied to. I understand that my scores in reading and writing were average, but it was the low math score which really hurt my chances of admission. This might seem like a personal argument, but the fact remains that I'm sure many students would agree with me. I understand including algebra and geometry, but I don't see why they include trigonometry.

I got my undergrad in Math and I am working on my Masters in Stats, but just because I don't see myself as needing reading or writing that does not mean that others feel the same way.\n\nMy personal opinion of the SAT and ACT is less that is it to make a \"well rounded\" person and more to set a bar for entrance into selective schools.  To your opening point, the SAT did not prevent you from going to college it just prevented you for attending a more selective college, one that desires a higher level of math knowledge than the ones that accepted you.\n\nIt has little to do with you and more to do with the statistics of placing people.  If someone has a better understanding of math they will be able to understand more things in general (all else being held constant).  \n\nSecond Response: \nTrigonometry is a basic staple of most college level math courses and should have been touched upon enough in Geometry that you could do well on it. An SAT score is meant to compliment your work in high school. The SAT itself isn't a measure of what you have learned in high school, but more of a measure of what you still need to learn. Low grades combined with a high SAT score show that you know more of what you are required to learn in college and can be moved ahead with courses though you may fail to do work.\n\nThe problem you have isn't that you didn't do well on the SAT, it's that you were average with everything else. You weren't accepted to colleges not because you didn't do well on the SAT, but because you didn't show that you were a hard enough worker to make up for any deficit you might have had.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the tone and emotional approach of the first response, which is more empathetic and acknowledges the original poster's struggles with math.

You could say \"entertainment\", but I think it's more than just that. Most works of literature have some sort of moral dilemma that questions an aspect of our society. A good piece of writing is designed to make the reader feel empathetic towards the characters, so the events that occur due to the choices the characters make with regards to the dilemma, in the end will suggest to the reader what is *right* versus what is *wrong*.   \n \nI was discussing this with my girlfriend the other day, and we used \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" as an example. My point was that this book shows (among other things) that racism and prejudice is morally wrong. She argued that this wasn't the intention of the book; the book just addresses the issue of prejudice in a neutral way, and it is up to the reader's internal moral compass to decide whether racism is right or wrong. While it is certainly possible to read the book and not have your views on racism changed, I argue that it was the author's intention to suggest that it was wrong.     \n  \nHere, I extend my argument to the majority of all literature. Great works of literature such as To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Catcher in the Rye, etc, are all intended to persuade readers to one side of a moral issue. Over history, stories and literature are a great way of defining what we as a race have defined as right and wrong.  \n\n**CMV!**\n  \n  \n_________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is certainly possible to look at this exploration from one specific lens (it's all about class; it's all about morality; it's all about learning to die and creating new life to carry on afterwards; etc).  But I don't think it's super helpful to constrain yourself that way.  If you look at Hamlet and understand his dilemma to be a fundamentally moral one, I think you are missing most of the picture.  There are moral dimensions to be sure, but those do not tell the whole story. \n\nSecond Response: \nAn argument can certainly be made that literature exists as means to explore the human condition, but morality is only one part of that.  The bulk of narrative works contain an element of morality in the story, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the work is about morality.  Rather, the reason that so many stories contain moral themes is because morality is an essential part of the human condition.  Consciousness, thought, knowledge, growth, life, death, society, and empathy (which is inexplicably tied to morality) are all crucial parts of the human experience, and the bulk of narrative works also contain these elements and, either explicitly or implicitly, make judgments and statements about them.

I would find this argument much more convincing if Uber weren't exempt from almost every rule and regulation by which the TLC governs traditional taxi services, on dubious legal grounds.  Yellow (and green) cabs in NYC must comply with many rules, including car safety inspections, emissions checks and other environmental regulations, and driver background checks.  Whether you agree with these rules or not (and I certainly have some questions about some of them), the fact remains that they are expensive to follow and that cost is of course passed on to the consumer by the cabs.  \n\n\nUber is not competing in a free market at all, in the sense of operating more efficiently to offer a lower price-- they're just gouging their competition by flouting the law.  If Uber (or anyone else) disagrees with these laws (such as the regulation of fares), they can of course use the political process to try to get them changed, but in that case they should be changed for regular cabs also.

No street-hail is the biggest difference. Uber already does background checks, etc., and they are very strict about banning drivers for bad behavior. Can you provide evidence that cabs are better or safer in any way vis-a-vis specific rules that they have to follow, while Uber drivers are \"getting away with\" skirting those rules?\n\nThey recognized an inefficiency in the market as it relates to taxi licensing and took advantage of that by offering a similar service that avoids those issues. About that part you are totally right. And for all the years and years of people trying to \"use the political process\" to get those inefficient laws changed changed with no success, within just a couple of years things are closer to changing than they ever would have been otherwise. There is no reason why they should have to handicap themselves by following laws that don't apply to them just because their service is similar to that of a taxi. \n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;There should never be a situation where there is one set of rules and regulations for regular cabs and a separate set for Uber.\n\nRight, there shouldn't be. There are some places where Uber is lobbying to get itself exempted from existing regulations, and that's wrong.\n\nBut I think pretty much everyone agrees with you there.

{"index": 196, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Political candidates who refuse to detail their policies are making the right choice.\n\nOriginal Post: \nEvery election year this is one of the most popular complaints against  candidates: lack of detailed policy prescriptions. \n\n* \"So and so says he's going to reduce the budget, but so far he hasn't offered any specifics.\"  \n\n* \"Hillary says she has a plan for restarting the Israel-Palestine peace process, but so far nobody has been able to nail her down on the details.\" \n\n* Recently right here on one of the CMV posts about Bernie Sanders, /u/bayernownz1995 says that \"Sanders *does* have a solid page on racial injustice on his site, but it is a little weak in terms of actual policy prescriptions. Compared to O'Malley's page, Sanders has a lot of work to do.\"\n\nYou hear these complaints all. The. Time. In newspapers, on blogs, on TV news, in debates, etc. Candidate X offers no details, they're evasive in answering questions, they're canny, they give bland lip service to a problem and make happy talk about solutions, but they never *actually say what it is they're going to do if elected*. It's like the default setting of oppo research, a ready-made criticism to hurl at a candidate if you don't have any meatier, muddier dirt to fling their way. \n\nBut the thing is, there are very good reasons for candidates to be evasive. For one thing, if they were to offer actual policy details during a campaign, then they'd spend the entire rest of the campaign defending and arguing about those details. If someone found an error or mistake or potential pitfall, they might have to revise their plan -- revise a policy that doesn't even exist yet! Political opponents hire specialists in opposition research, and the more material those specialists have, the more they'll be able to distract and distort your candidate's plan in order to make them look bad. Giving them an entire piece of draft legislation, or an entire detailed budget document showing cuts and spending, etc. would be like a godsend to the oppo research people. And all for what? For an imaginary policy that doesn't even exist yet. No candidate in their right mind would open up so many vulnerabilities all for the sake of a policy that doesn't even exist outside of the candidate's website. \n\nSecondly, no political candidate is running for the office of dictator. Whether someone is running for President, Senate, Congress, Governor, state legislator, dog catcher, etc., the important thing to remember is that politicians have to work with other politicians, and agencies, bureaucracies, other constituents, etc. They have to work with other people to get anything accomplished. So if you get elected to office with a complete, massively detailed economic stimulus package combined with spending cuts and tax cuts, don't expect every other member of Congress to just roll over and rubber stamp your policy. Politics isn't beanbag, and you'd get crucified by the players in Washington (or any other capital). Oh, you promised you were going to cut the F-22 fighter? Well guess what, that's going to throw 60,000 people out of work in my district. And you want me to just vote for it because *your* supporters voted for you? How about f--k you?\" \n\nIf you got elected with a detailed policy proposal, everyone in the government responsible for putting your policy into motion would have you over a barrel. Every change they make to your policy would threaten to make you a \"liar,\" a judas, a traitor, etc. to the people who supported you, as well of course as your political enemies. Your policy details would become a millstone around your neck and a gun to your head. Your friends and enemies alike would be able to use all of your detailed promises on the campaign trail in order to wrap you around their fingers.\n\nSo that's my view: politicians would be insane to offer detailed policy answers to any given question, and they are wise to stick to vague generalities, advertising language, happy talk, etc. Can you think of a good reason for politicians to spell out their promises in detail? \n\n**EDIT -- After 16 hours, most challengers haven't dug very deep into the issue or looked at it from different angles. For instance, what about examples of actual candidates who did in fact provide detailed proposals during an election? Did they pay for it or benefit from it?

Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- **First Response:** This response uses a logical and somewhat personalized tone by drawing a parallel between government accountability and personal finance. The use of a hypothetical situation creates relatability and may resonate with readers who appreciate practical analogies. \n- **Second Response:** The tone is more direct and somewhat confrontational, emphasizing skepticism toward vague promises. It feels urgent and somewhat dismissive of politicians who cannot provide specifics, emphasizing the need for clarity in political communication.\n\n**2. Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- **First Response:** The analogy of going to a bank for a loan serves as a rhetorical device that aims to showcase the expectation of detailed plans in finance and how that expectation should similarly apply to politics. This approach helps ground the argument in a familiar scenario for many.\n- **Second Response:** This response uses assertive language and rhetorical questioning to convey frustration with vague political promises. The comparison between general budget cuts and specific cuts of military vs. education is an effective use of contrast to underscore the need for clarity. \n\n**3. Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- **First Response:** The sentence structure is straightforward with clear points, making it accessible. The analogies used promote a conversational but clear argument.\n- **Second Response:** While also largely readable, this response combines shorter, emphatic sentences with an engaging critique of political candidates. This combination makes for a punchy and engaging read, but it may come off as more aggressive at times.\n\n**4. Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- **First Response:** The engagement is somewhat indirect, as it poses a hypothetical scenario rather than directly addressing the original poster's claims. It proposes a question of expectation but doesn\u2019t deeply engage with the original argument.\n- **Second Response:** This response engages more directly with the original post's examples and rhetoric. By dissecting the claims made about budget reduction and providing a clear demand for specifics, it frames the argument as an extension of the original discussion and challenges the original poster\u2019s assumptions directly.\n\n### Prediction\n\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Key Factors\nThe second response is likely to have been more effective in changing the original poster's view due to its direct engagement with the original points raised about political candidates. By systematically dismantling the idea that vague promises are acceptable, it forces the original poster to confront their assumptions about political communication. The critical tone and frustration expressed may resonate with others and highlight the inherent issues with the original argument, potentially prompting reflection or reconsideration from the original poster.

I know that personally, my paychecks are taxed between 25 and 30%, depending on overtime and the like, and it makes it feel so much more that instead of extra cash in my pocket, for going above the 40 hour work week standard, it's cash in the government's pocket.\n\nOf course, this might also be influenced by my somewhat libertarian leanings, in that I consider taxation in general an... unnecessary evil. It's a fact of life I'll admit, but I don't think that it should be.

If you make more money, the tax rate only changes on money made above the threshold.  This is an important distinction.\n\nFor example, in the US you pay 10% on earning up to $9,075.  Then you pay 15% tax on money made **between** $9,076 and $36,900.\n\nSo, someone who makes $10,000 doesn't pay a 15% tax rate.  There actual tax is \n\n* 10% on $9,075 = $907.50\n* 15% on $925 = $138.75\n\nFor a total tax burden of 1046.25 or an effective tax rate of 10.46%\n\nSecond Response: \nAs a place to begin, I want to make sure we're discussing the same system here.  A graduated (or progressive) tax system does **not** punish you for earning more.\n\nA simplistic variable system would look like -\n\n- For the first $0 - $9,999 of income - Tax Rate = 0%\n- For the income between $10,000 - $29,999 - Tax Rate = 10%\n- For the income between $30,000 - $74,999 - Tax Rate = 20%\n- For the income greater than $75,000 - Tax Rate = 35%\n\nKeep in mind that if you make $15,000 in a year you aren't taxed 10% on the whole amount ($1,500) but rather 0% on the first $9,999 and then 10% on the remaining $5001 (for $500.10) so the resulting total tax paid in this example is $500.10\n\nAs you scale up the government does take more money... but your net income (after tax) *is also increasing*.  \n\nAs for why increased earners should pay more % tax - because they can actually sustain the loss.  All humans have the same basic requirements for life (ie Food, Clothing, Shelter) plus additional requirements (Transportation, Entertainment, Education etc.) that need to be met in some fashion.  While it is true that the rich tend to have larger expenses, a simple thought exercise leads to the conclusion that (unless your rich person is insanely overspending) as their income grows the total % of their income devoted to \"necessities\" as opposed to \"luxuries\" declines.  \n\nBy that logic, asking the higher income people to carry more of the burden makes sense - the people who are most able to sustain the loss are the ones taking the loss, while the people who are least able to sustain take the least loss.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the **tone and emotional approach** as well as the **engagement with the original poster** in the second response.

{"index": 198, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The United States lost World War II\n\nOriginal Post: \nI believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.\n\nI am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.\n\nContrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.\n\nWhat really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?\n\nSorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Locking up a human toddler in a way too small cage just for education is an obvious no-go, so animals such as parrots, elephants, dolphins and chimpanzees which have all demonstrated high degrees of intelligence and emotions should never be kept in a cage. As long as they are, a zoo can *not* be considered ethical. Many of these animals are demonstrably miserable in captivity and will lead lives far inferior to the lives they would lead in either the wild or in wild-like conditions. As long as we can not provide these conditions to them we should never lock them up.\n\nNot to mention zoos break up family groups of animals which have demonstrated strong social bonds such as orcas and elephants, to sell the babies to other zoos. This is scarring the animals emotionally to the point where the animals will grief for long periods of time. This is not only heartbreaking but also unethical.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think the bottom line is if none of the animals held captive in the zoo are sentient/sapient/self aware/ then it can't be moral, but if only non sentient/sapient/self aware/ animals are held captive then it can be. \n\nJust think of it as though aliens kept you captive in their zoo. Are there any conditions that would justify that? Not really. But on the other side of the spectrum, it doesn't matter what you do with a fly. \n\nI know I could debate until the end of time with some people about which animals do and don't apply for person rights, and you could argue that since humans are not on the same page about that, then zoos are unethical, but the reality is that we can know which animals are at risk of deserving person rights, and which are not, and there are far fewer animals that do, than don't. \n\nSo, zoos could still work.

There are always those who will see particular groups of people as \"less than\" those around them. So who should be granted that wonderful task of determining such a thing? You? What makes you more qualified than others to determine the worth of another person's life, especially if you're not even the one responsible for taking care of it?\n\nWhat if those in charge of making such decisions started doing so on the basis of race? What about eliminating people who practice particular religions? Sometimes the reason not to do something (like eliminating inconvenient groups of people) isn't because it adds a direct benefit to society to keep them, but because to engage in such an act would make that society less worth living in (because of who that society would require us to be in order to be a part of it).\n\nYour dislike of those who are mentally handicapped is subjective, as are the other examples mentioned here. If I have someone in my family who is mentally handicapped, but feel as though his or her presence adds to the overall quality of our life experiences, who are you to tell us that this family member isn't contributing to our overall well-being? Who are you to decide that this family member of mine should be eliminated simply because it makes you uncomfortable?\n\nSometimes the act of living in society is itself a social commitment to one another, that in times when we are not at our best requires the people as a whole to maintain an obligation to one another that says we will help to take up the slack in times when we the individual may not always be able to carry the load. It's this social contract to one another that allows us to have a certain level of existential anxiety relieved, because even if we are struggling ourselves, we know that our friends, our family, and sometimes even the society as a whole will help us through. While it's fine to condemn others and say \"but I've never needed such services or support from others\", this doesn't mean that you or those you love never will.\n\nSecond Response: \nI totally get where you are coming from.\n\nI had a job between jobs that was basically acting as a chaperone/aide taking adults with disabilities to socialize, go to classes and volunteer around the city.\n\nYes, I saw how tired their family must be and I'm pretty sure that  I dont want to raise a child with a disability. I'm selfish, but at the same time you never know how you will act until you are facing the problem.\n\nDuring the time I spent with these people, I got to know them and become friends with some. They are just like us deep down and they want the same things. They are capable of learning, adapting and have wants and needs. \n\nLumping them all into one giant entity is wrong. The range of ability between individual is different. I knew people who could navigate the city on their own and more or less live independently. They are able to work, read, write, make friends, have boyfriends/girlfriends, get married (and they do!). They have senses of humor and are kind and want to help others. I really believe that deep down inside they have thoughts like you and me, but it just gets lost somewhere along the way when they try to communicate.\n\nYes, they are a \"drain on society\", but so are a lot of able people.\n\nI might have been like you before I spent real time with them.

That is enough to deserve some respect and gratitude. That doesn't mean they can't lose it because they do crappy things, but it is worth quite a bit in itself, and it does deserve respect.\n\nIn the case of arguments, there's two points that I think are important. First of all, you'll have found that there are many situations in life where \"because I said so\" is something you'll have to submit to if you want to achieve certain goals. Ever had a job? Ever had a boss who told you what to do? Did they always talk you through the reasons for the required actions step by step? It would be nice if they did, because even in a job I'd quite like to know why I'm doing what I'm doing, but they're not required to because they give you money.\n\nIf your parents say you can't wear a cap at the table because they said so, then that's fair enough. They're feeding you. You're free to get up and move out and buy your own food, but as long as they're providing for you, they can make rules, even if the rules are stupid and arbitrary and you don't agree with them. I personally don't think that's a very good attitude and I hope I won't be that kind of parent, but I can't really argue with it.\n\nAlso, I've had similar conversations with parents because, as I said, I do in principle agree with you, and I'd very much like to be a parent who explains things to their children and encourages them not to take things for granted or as given without questioning them. But I've been told that this just gets tedious sometimes. Maybe you spend 15 hours a day actively dealing with your child. Children ask all the questions and want to do all the things, and if you at some point run out of patience and don't want to explain something for the nth time, I think saying \"because I said so\" is still not ideal, but perfectly understandable. \n\nWith your last statement, I'm not sure which age you have in mind. But people of any age really sometimes suck at logic, and children even more so, so there are arguments that can't be solved this way because no side will admit out of their own accord that they're wrong. And in some cases there isn't even necessarily wrong or right, because it depends on how much you care about certain things. You can't drag arguments out forever. You need to get on with your life at some point. \n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; This is why I think that giving the reason 'because I said so' is a total cop out. If the parent is not open to having a conversation about the reason for their actions, then I don't think they deserve the child's respect.\n\nI think you will find that as a parent, this would be an impossible situation. You say that \"respect needs to be earned\", but isn't this a two way street? Maybe you think the parent who says \"because I said so\" hasn't done enough to earn the child's respect. But has the child done anything to earn respect either? If the parent tried to rationally explain why they're right to the child, how confident are you that the child will understand and \"can admit when they are wrong and that their decisions are well-thought-out\". If they can't, then a rational two-way discussion just isn't going to happen.\n\nAnd if such a discussion can't happen yet, what now? Should the parent and child just \"agree to disagree\"? Of course not. I wouldn't frame it as some kind of \"debt\" that arises out of giving birth, but I think its pretty widely acknowledged that parents are responsible for their child's behavior, even before the child is wise enough to understand complicated reasoning. As a third part, I *expect* other parents to keep their children in line, even if their children aren't smart enough to understand why certain behavioral expectations exist.\n\nAnd similar phenomena happen for all positions of authority. If a police officer is directing traffic, he doesn't have to explain to you the details of what's going on. You have to listen to him anyway. \"Because I said so\" would be a perfectly reasonable thing for him to say when him explaining what's going on in more detail would hold up traffic (especially if you then decide for whatever reason that you disagree). Similarly, there are many employer-employee relationships where \"because I said so\" should be good enough for you. One hopes that there is a good reason behind the requests, but the employee is in no way entitled to a full breakdown of exactly why everything works the way it does, especially when time is of the essence. Its embedded into the nature of these relationships that you follow orders.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the second response's emphasis on the mutual nature of respect in parent-child relationships.

Are you sure?\n\nFirst Response: \nThe kid you've linked to in that news article is 17 right now. You're saying he should face decades of imprisonment for what he's done... now think about that, really. We throw around punishment very severely in our society, but really think about what you're saying. If you lock him up for 20 years, he'll get out when he's 37; for 30 and he'll be 47; for 40 and he'll be 57 years old. We're talking about a child's life here. Granted, what he did is undoubtedly wrong, and I cannot imagine being a victim, having a SWAT team in full gear and weaponry busting down your family's door has to be one of the scariest experiences I can think of. That said, this is still a 17 year old child. A moron really, if only by age. Can you imagine the person you were 10 years ago, and how different you were? Or the person you were in high school? This is just some idiot kid who thought he was pranking people. Put him away for 5 years, that's still a massive amount of time, but when he gets out you'll more than likely have someone who is truly sorry. If you don't let him out until he's in his 30's or 40's, you have effectively destroyed his entire life. He'll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he's already got this criminal record, he'll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult... Sometimes I think we lock some people away for far too long and don't actually think about what it would have to be like sitting in a room for so many hundreds or thousands of days. \n\nSecond Response: \nThis would be well outside the norm of how we sentence people.\n\nIn the case of swatting, we're talking about 2 crimes:\n\nReckless endangerment and filing a false police report.\n\nIn NY (my state), this would be reckless endangerment in the first degree, which is:\n\n&gt;A person is guilty of reckless endangerment in the first degree when,\nunder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life, he\nrecklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to\nanother person.\nReckless endangerment in the first degree is a class D felony.\n\nAs a violent class D felony, this would carry a minimum sentence of 2 years, and a maximum sentence of 7 years.\n\nIf a person did in fact die during the raid, they'd be guilty of manslaughter in the second degree, defined as:\n\n&gt;A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when:\n    1. He recklessly causes the death of another person; ...\nManslaughter in the second degree is a class C felony.\n\nAs a violent class C felony, this would carry a minimum sentence of 3 1/2 years, and a maximum sentence of 15 years.\n\nThe above would be possibly increased if the defendant has prior convictions - those all assume no priors.\n\nTo get to the length of sentence you're talking about, we would need to upgrade them to class C (in the case of reckless endangerment) or class B (in the case of manslaughter).  But we start bumping into some irrationality then.\n\nI don't think swatting, without physical harm done, is the same severity as manslaughter.  Manslaughter is a really serious crime.  And if you want to upgrade the punishment if it becomes a manslaughter, then you're talking about punishing it like a murder (murder is a class B felony, sometimes class A).  But it isn't as serious as a murder.\n\nSwatting can be severely punished.  The crimes above carry substantial sentences.  A conviction for 1st degree reckless endangerment (which swatting is), has a mandatory minimum prison sentence, so it's not like you can get off with a slap on the wrist.\n\nBut decades in prison is essentially reserved for murderers, rapists, and serial criminals.  And it should be.  /b/tards aren't as evil as murderers.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the emotional and empathetic tone of the First Response.

This approach, along with its readability and conversational structure, engages the original poster on a deeper emotional level than the second response which is more clinical and focused on legal definitions and potential sentences.

It's something that I hope you come to understand as a generally unnecessary procedure.\n\n&gt;The WHO currently recommends male circumcision for HIV prevention and \"as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package\". It is primarily recommended in areas with high incidences of HIV, but given its demonstrated effect at reducing the spread of the virus I prefer to have any added protection possibly available.\n\nWHO recommends this for areas with massively high incidences of HIV. Do you live in one of these places? If so, do you even fall under the statistical danger zone? At some point, everyone weighs the chances. Otherwise, you wouldn't have to worry about STDs because you wouldn't have sex **at all**.\n\n&gt; I would plan to infer the same protection to any hypothetical children born at this time, especially considering that the complication rates here are significantly lower than in the areas where it is most strongly recommended by the WHO.\n\nWhy should we assume that it will be necessary by then? If we are talking about taking someone's bodily autonomy away, shouldn't we at least be certain that it is a dire and immediate threat?\n\n&gt;Because of this, many to most potential sexual partners in my area (including myself, as a gay male) prefer the aesthetic of a circumcised penis.\n\nTo me, this seems like a valid reason to have the procedure done, *but to ONESELF*.

After all, we can charge parents for neglect or abuse.\n\nThe point is, parents are *responsible* for their child's health, but at least in the United States, they are not given *complete dominion* over the child's body. There are things that they CANNOT do, and most people against circumcision would argue that this should be added to that list.

I lost over 60lbs. I understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight, but considering I have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one, and still lost weight. I just don't understand.\n\nI'm starting to look at fat loss as simply a matter of accepting that your diet is flawed and making changes. People have false views of how healthy they eat and this pride prevents them from making changes they need. \n\nEverytime I post something like this I just get a million downvotes. Why do people downvote me? Is it because I'm wrong somehow and millions of people truly can't lose weight.\n\nEdit: Okay it makes more sense. \"Simply\" being a troubled word that implies weight loss is easy. That was incorrect.\n\n I was obese as a child and lost the weight when I grew old enough to buy and prepare my own food. I'm blessed with a preference for the healthy food and slowly taught myself to lower my appetite, making my experience easier than most. I shouldn't project myself so much on other people.\n\nNo one is arguing thermodynamics or saying weight loss is impossible. Everyone is saying that it is hard and after varies arguments I'm inclined to agree.\n\nHowever, while weight loss is hard due to various factors, they do have solutions. ex: An emotional eater can indivually work out their food addiction. While it isn't easy, it can be done. I can't settle for \"can't\". I feel like that is too dismissive and hopeless. \n\nBut it is a matter of willpower. The debate is whether people can control their willpower. It is also a matter of wanting to lose weight. Settling for being overweight is a choice a lot of people seem to make. But I guess its sort of the same thing as smoking. Something in theory can be fixed by putting down the cigarette but a ton of inner strife.\n\nBut in all seriousness, for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them (I forgot to mention I'm a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors. Nutrition actually has little classes on psychology and weight loss, and mostly cooking and science classes. I sorta rely on reddit to educate myself.\n\nHow can weight loss become easier? What can I do? What can society do? Etc\n\nAlso, I'm kinda hung up on few things. I feel like while people may not want to, pretty much every condition can be overcome. With the exception of people with extremely low BMRs where the subsequent nutrient defences and hunger pangs outweigh the benefits of wright loss.\n\nSo I guess my view has been partially changed. So like \"half deltas all around\". When I figure out how to give a delta I will award particularly thought provoking comments. \n\nEdit 2: oh I forgot to mention I never ever condone bullying or shaming fat people. The never directly tell people they should lose weight. From when I was fat \"my mirror tells me I'm fat everyday, I don't need to hear it from anyone else\"\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The important part of your question is whether any person can actually make the adjustments to diet and exercise to produce (and sustain) weight loss.\n\nPeople are not robots. We are subject to forces of emotion, motivation, willpower, bias, and so on.\n\nThat which seems objectively simple to accomplish in isolation can be exceedingly difficult in practice. I believe that everyone can directly observe this to be true with a moment's reflection on their own shortcomings and struggles.\n\n* \"I'm not going to procrastinate anymore.\"\n* \"I won't yell at him anymore.\"\n* \"I'm going to go running every day.\"\n* \"I'll never again drink until I throw up.\"\n* \"I'm going to stop spending so much money.\"\n* \"I won't let sports make me this angry again.\"\n* \"It's irrational for me to be so jealous.\"\n* \"Why should I care if I'm not invited to some party?\"\n\nPain, sadness, boredom, loneliness, routine, socially embedded temptation, fatigue, stress, cognitive biases, competing demands, family crisis, fear, money issues, disease, social learning, etc. -- all of these are capable of derailing sincere efforts at personal change.\n\nIf there anything in your life you have decided to change and yet have not been able to change, then this argument should ring true.\n\nA person has become fat because they are not good at regulating diet and exercise for whatever reason (biological, psychological, social-cultural, environmental/circumstantial, etc.). Almost by definition, these are people who struggle to adjust diet and exercise. It is therefore like saying \"Any depressed person can be happier by simply adjusting their thoughts and feelings\" or \"Any anxious person ... by caring less about the future\" or \"Sex addict ... by choosing not to engage in sexual acts\" or \"debtor ... by earning more and spending less\" or \"smoker .. by not smoking.\" These are true but useless statements, because the person in question practically lacks the abilities required given their current set of circumstances. Advice for all of these kinds of problems centers on how to change psychology or circumstances rather than on the simple idea of the end goal (eat less, smoke less, yell less).\n\nThat is why there are books and communities and medicines and science and billions of dollars centered on these kinds of personal change efforts. What's required is a change in the environment/circumstances or in the psychology - and that's not easy to do at all.\n\nLet me flip this around. Can you imagine a scenario where a person cannot successfully accomplish the needed adjustment to diet and exercise?\n\nGo over to a place like /r/progresspics and read comments on how people were able to accomplish their transformation. Generally, you'll hear about some fairly specific  set of factors that helped them start and then persist in their journey. New ideas, supportive friends, emotional growth, frightening experiences, a definite system, a change in life situation, regular efforts to stay motivated, and so on.\n\nNow while reading something like that, start mentally deleting the factors that they are crediting. \"I couldn't have done it without the help of my wife\" - take away the wife. \"I found boxing and that was what clicked after years of nothing clicking\" - boxing was never a sport. \"I finally decided to prioritize my self and take care of myself\" - they were struggling to make it day to day due to environmental stressors (small kids, money problems, work stress, emotionally abusive person in life) and couldn't focus on personal growth. \"The doctor said I would die before I was 50\" - the complications of overweight not being as present for them and the doc never delivering that warning.\n\nThen, there's the reality that most of us are flawed or face challenge in many ways at once. It's not just being overweight - it's being overweight and poor. It's not just being fat - it's being fat and depressed. Fat and short-tempered. Fat and failing some classes. Fat and an emotionally absent father. Fat and financially irresponsible. Overweight and socially anxious.  And generally the list is much longer than just two problems. Many people who want to be better people are pouring a lot of energy into working on something other than being overweight, and it leaves little for the other problem.  Conversely, many who successfully lose a lot of weight do so by streamlining and focusing their attention on that specific problem at the expense of other things they could have focused on instead.\n\nAll this to say, personal change requires work, and some forms of personal change require so much work as to be practically impossible given the resources and energy available to accomplish that work. That's why successful weight loss often requires much much more than just the idea of eating less and exercising more. And until the person finds that other thing that is required for their situational factors to shift enough to change the behavior, they are unlikely to be successful in adjusting diet and exercise over the long run.\n\n**EDIT**: I want to add something to speak to the other side of the coin because some comments have rightly pointed out that this may come across as fatalistic. I'm a big proponent of personal responsibility and personal growth. \n\nIf you have something in your life causing problems or holding you back, I would encourage you to look for solutions and - if it's important enough of a thing - to not give up. I have worked with a lot of people with mental health issues, for example, who say, \"I can't\" to things that they absolutely are capable of doing and do go on to do. An attitude of pessimism is often a self-fulfilling prophecy and certainly limits the chances we have to get lucky with the solution to the puzzle or simply to break through due to persistence. The synthesis of my views would be this: we are shaped by many forces but are also capable of ingenuity, resiliency, and change. If you attempt something critically important and fail, either try again, try a new approach, or try something else.\n\nChange is not as simple as 'eat less' because behavior is largely the product of a network of causal factors. And for the exact same reason, change is also rarely impossible - there are many factors that can be tweaked up and down the causal chain, though it can take A LOT of effort and probably resources and external support as well. The right small shift can alter the overall set of circumstances and tip the outcome in another direction. And sometimes, it's something as simple as time or trying again.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou make some good points, but I don't think your blanket conclusion holds. I mean, first off:\n\n&gt; I understand that conditions can limit someones ability to easily lose weight, but considering I have 2 physical ones and 1 mental one, and still lost weight. I just don't understand.\n\nNot everyone has the same condition you did. This is basically saying \"If I could do it, anyone could!\" ...which is rarely true.\n\n&gt; The debate is whether people can control their willpower.\n\nIf this is the debate, then I think science has shown pretty conclusively by now that people have very little control or insight over their own minds. There are entire industries built around this premise.\n\nIt turns out that most of human reasoning is unconscious, that we make decisions *before* we're consciously aware that we've made them. This is pretty well established, scientifically -- if you wire a person up properly, you can actually tell exactly what decision they're going to make before *they* know what they'll decide. Your \"reasons\" for making the decision are often after-the-fact *rationalizations.*\n\nThis is why advertising works so well. *Rarely,* you can actually make a perfectly rational decision. Most of the time, you don't have enough information to actually know which brand of toothpaste is the best value for the money -- and even if you did, the amount of mental effort it would take is worth less to you than the amount of money you'd save. It's not even that -- you won't ever do that calculation, you'll instead just *subconsciously* give up on the rational approach and just pick something.\n\nAt which point, the [mere-exposure effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect) means you'll probably pick something you've heard of, like Colgate. Then, maybe you'll say it was because you like the Enhanced Whitening or whatever bullshit is on the box, because you like to think of yourself as rational. And, here's the key, *you'll do all that without realizing it.* You won't remember that you've seen a Colgate ad, you certainly won't realize you're buying it because of a Colgate ad, but you are.\n\nThat's you, that's me, that's pretty much all of humanity, except when we're putting a ton of conscious mental effort into thinking rationally.\n\nAnd that's a decision you make because of a subtle message you've heard a few times on TV or something. Put the same lazy, irrational brain up against a basic biological impulse, like hunger or sex or even a craving for sugar, and it becomes *much* more difficult.\n\nThat is why dieting fails. Just telling people to eat fewer calories is about as effective as abstinence-only sex education. Abstinence-only education doesn't fail because abstinence doesn't work, it fails because **people don't abstain.** The science is also settled on this one -- abstinence-only sex education *universally* leads to higher pregnancy rates than proper sex education. And, similarly, the science is pretty settled on diets -- the act of \"going on a diet\" almost never actually makes a difference in the long term, because people fall off their diets and gain back all that weight and more.\n\nSo no, people don't have control over their willpower, at least not enough to make a change like this stick through willpower alone.\n\n&gt; But in all seriousness, for all people who do want to loose weight. How can I help them (I forgot to mention I'm a nutrition student) loose weight by dealing with psychological factors.\n\nFirst, don't take my word for the above. Take a psychology course or two. Read [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555). You're a student, go study. I'm sure as hell not a primary source, and if this is going to be your job, I really hope you get better at it than I am.\n\nMy advice to people wanting to lose weight would be: Instead of picking diets by how catchy their marketing is or how strong the science is, pick a diet on this basis alone: How likely are you to be able to stick to this diet for the rest of your life? Same for an exercise program -- and do both of those things.\n\nFor example, [I like this](http://www.nosdiet.com/). I know you've taken some flack for the word \"simple\", but simplicity is a big part of this -- it has to be *really, stupidly, painfully obvious* that you're cheating, otherwise you'll say things like \"It's okay to have this donut, because I went jogging this morning.\" To make it even easier, if you find yourself thinking that, you don't have to deny yourself donuts, just hold off till Saturday and have a donut then.\n\nI'd start with something like that to reduce the *amount* they're eating, and then, as a secondary concern, make some suggestions for healthy stuff they could be eating instead.\n\n&gt; What can society do?\n\nA hell of a lot more.\n\nFor example, I used to think that [these restrictions were stupid](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2910). But it actually makes a ton of sense -- if I get a small container of sugary drink, I'll still probably only get one container. And we still tend to drink the entire container of whatever and then stop, unless we really are that thirsty (which is almost never) -- so I'll probably drink that one container and then stop.\n\nIt's nanny-state-ish and infantilizing, but I'll bet it works. I'm really curious what the results will be.\n\nAnother example, this time about smoking: When you require [this kind of labeling](http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Australia_Cigarettes_Packaging.jpg), people really do smoke less. I'm not sure how you'd decide what sorts of food you should put a picture of Fat Bastard on, but I'll bet if you did that, people would eat less of them. These are visceral, gut reactions *in the moment.* The sort of thing that will punch through to that subconscious lizard brain that was about to buy you a pack of cigarettes (or a Big Mac), and at the very least wake up your conscious brain and give you a fighting chance.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Empirical and Scientific Approach**: The second response directly references scientific findings regarding human behavior and decision-making, lending credibility to its arguments. It explains the unconscious aspects of decision-making, analyzed through psychology, which offers a more nuanced view that acknowledges the complexity of willpower and dieting. This could resonate more with the original poster's desire for a deeper understanding of weight loss challenges.\n\n2. **Tone and Engagement**: The second response maintains a conversational tone while also presenting counterpoints to the original poster's assertions. Its use of examples from everyday life and analogies, such as comparing dieting to ineffective sex education, makes complex ideas more relatable and engaging. This empathetic yet critical approach could facilitate a more profound level of reflection in the original poster.\n\n3. **Actionable Suggestions**: Unlike the first response that elaborates on the challenges without proposing much in terms of practical guidance, the second response offers concrete advice for dieting and how to approach weight loss. This aligns closely with the original poster\u2019s quest for how to help others lose weight.\n\nOverall, the second response provides a balanced mix of scientific backing, relatable analogies, and practical advice, creating a more compelling argument that could plausibly reshape the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": true}

There are two ways to convince these prospective candidates of the Darwin award - authority or emotion. Appeal to emotion requires some introspection and determining your own worth to your family etc. This is intellectually more involved than common sense and thus clearly beyond the capabilities of these individuals. Therefore, an appeal to authority, like law, is your only chance.\n\nSecond Response: \nI agree that it is an appeal to authority.  I still think it is a good slogan, because many people are have either pre-conventional (how do I avoid punishment) or conventional (what does the law state) morality.  Against this sort of morality, it is a perfectly reasonable argument.  As the goal is not to make a perfectly sound argument, but rather to convince people to buckle their seatbelts, the slogan is effective.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the tone and emotional approach used in the Second Response compared to the First Response.

This critical engagement establishes a constructive dialogue, making it more likely to resonate with the original poster.\n\nIn contrast, the First Response opts for a more condescending tone by labeling those who need the slogan as lacking in intelligence and common sense. This could alienate the original poster and diminish the effectiveness of the response.

{"index": 209, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Women being underrepresented is not a real problem.\n\nOriginal Post: \nHi.\n\nWhenever I read about people trying to \n\n- increase the number of women in science or engineering\n- increase the number of women in politics\n- increase the number of women in positions of power\n- increase the number of women that are firefighters or police\n\nI can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. I have no problem at all with there being less women than men in any place. What I would (and do) have a problem with is women having it more difficult than men to enter certain professions. That is the real problem we should, as a society, try to solve.\n\nThe current approach is \"forcing\" the proportion of women to increase, by means of: \n\n- gender-specific student grants, \n- positions reserved for women, \n- lower physical requirements,\n- etc.\n\nAs I see it this kind of solutions are problematic in two ways:\n\n- They involve so-called \"positive discrimination\", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman. This is absurd and can increase animosity in the male coworkers. Admittedly, that would be wrong on their part, but it still can create an hostile work environment.\n\n- They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. \n\nThe only benefits I see is that \"artificially\" increasing the number of women in certain places may make the presence of women in said place appear less \"unusual\" to society, thereby decreasing the discrimination, but I still think they do more harm than good.\n\nReddit, change my view!\n\nPD: English is not my first language, so I apologize for any awkwardly phrased sentence I may have written, and welcome any correction. \n\nEDIT: In only a few hours there have been a lot of great answers that have confirmed my feeling that this was a more nuanced issue that I could even imagine. My view has been changed in that I had underestimated the benefits of this kind of measures. In particular I now see that:\n\n- Artificially increasing the number of women in certain fields makes said fields much less \"threatening\" to other women.\n- Makes male coworkers appreciate the capabilities of women, decreasing further discrimination.\n- Improves the selection process by eliminating male-favoring biases. Whenever a man less prepared than a woman would have got the position by conscious or unconscious biases a well-prepared woman will get it.\n\nI remain unconvinced that physical tests should have easier versions for women. Most people seemed to agree with me on this, though. I have realized, however, that jobs that at first seem to be mainly physical (police, firefighters, ...) would also benefit from having more women. \n\nSome of my favourite answers, where you can find studies supporting all of this, are:\n\n/u/Yxoque: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csompka\n\n/u/waldrop02: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csosztz\n\n/u/clairebones: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csorp8q\n\n/u/yes_thats_right:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bqwex/cmv_women_being_underrepresented_is_not_a_real/csoy213\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

That means, in this case, creating a countervailing bias to fix the original one.\n\nPeople have biases about how well women can do a job?  Putting women in those jobs will convince them they are wrong.\n\nWomen are less willing to enter a field because it is male dominated?  Temporary positive discrimination will fix them problem.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; I can't help feeling that it is a rather useless cause. \n\nI don't think it is. Every field that is dominantly one gender over another is going to miss out on talented people with novel insights. We shouldn't miss out on a qualified nurse because some bloke was told it wasn't a manly profession. Neither should we miss out on a qualified scientists because some girl was told science was for boys.\n\nUnless you have a good argument as for why certain genders are almost universally better at certain professions any sort of gender imbalance is going to cause society missing out on qualified people in the right place.\n\nAnd I think the police force is a special case, in this regard. I've seen firsthand how some people react to both male and female police officers and having a good gender balance is going to help civilians a lot. A lot of people are more comfortable discussing certain things with people from their own gender. Children will gravitate towards female police officers (and yes, this is also due to harmful gender roles in society, but we need a police that functions in the society we live in, not in the society we'd like to live in). \n\n&gt; They involve so-called \"positive discrimination\", which leads to cases where a candidate gets ahead of a fitter one only because the former is a woman.\n\nPeople often say this when talking about this, but I don't think this is completely true. We know from several studies that when applying for, well, anything, people are discriminated against based on their gender, skin color, sexuality, etc. Even if the resumes are completely identical, this still happens. So if a woman wants to enter a male dominated field, there's a good chance she's going to have to be **more** qualified than a man. Positive discrimination is intended to get (in this case) women accepted when they are \"merely\" equally qualified. \n\n&gt; They don't solve the real issue, which is the discrimination that would have stopped the women from getting the job. They may be able to overcome it thanks to external help, but even if we have solved the symptoms the problem is still there. \n\nAnd as soon as we have good, viable way to stop the discrimination from happening at all, we should implement that.

{"index": 210, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Elements created in a lab that cannot exist in nature or in quantities greater than a few atoms for microseconds at a time have no place on the periodic table\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium) or [ununtrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununtrium), I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table.\n\nThe atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.\n\nCalling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, \"Look! I've created a bookbottle!\"\n\nThe object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.\n\nUnunpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.\n\nChange my view.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. \n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n&gt;Short half life\n\nIt's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.\n\n&gt;Very few atoms at a time\n\nThis is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.\n\n&gt;Not outside the lab.\n\nWhere it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.\n\nThere are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion.\n\nFirst Response: \nYou're expressing a matter of aesthetic philosophy, rather than the rigid formalism of science. In chemistry, an 'element' is any atomic structure, no matter how short-lived or unstable.\n\nYour point of view is understandable from an entirely unscientific perspective, but from a chemist's perspective it's like suggesting that humans who don't make it to adulthood have no place in human records, because they didn't live to a certain popularly accepted arbitrary point, or that food that's only produced in kitchens instead of occurring on its own has no business being called food. And there are in fact people who have those views, so I'm just picking weird ideas out of the air. I chose ones that are really out there, in order to provide a more realistic perspective.\n\nA scientist is unconcerned with whether an element is found in nature or not. What does that even mean? In the decay series of many materials, many transitional elements *do* occur naturally, but don't stick around. Many of the elements that have been synthesized in laboratories *used* to exist naturally, but had short-lives too short to still be around this late in our planet's history. Plenty of elements are forged in the final moments of a star's life, but only last an instant. Do those elements 'exist in nature' or not, and according to whose criteria?\n\nLikewise, how long they last is also arbitrary. A millisecond is tiny for you and me, but it has no aesthetic or qualitative meaning to anything else. We could pick any arbitrary cutoff, but why should we pick any at all? Because some humans might feel better about it? How would that advance the goals of science? And what difference does it make to anyone else? It's not like someone's out there selling these materials for profit.\n\n\nSecond Response: \nThe problem is that the statement doesn't factor in something that should be implied.  *In our environment* those statements are true.  But science aims to understand the building blocks of existence.  Not just the way in which they are shaded in our small, *small* corner of existence.  \n\nMoreover the definition of a scientific element is \"...A substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means...\" So long as categorization fits the definition, it seems arbitrary to remove elements because they don't have properties that were never part of the original definition.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response employs a more diverse and engaging tone, invoking aesthetic philosophy to challenge the original poster's perspective.

{"index": 211, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: A Person under 18 should never be able to legally shoot firearms\n\nOriginal Post: \nA few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic.\n\nFrom some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms.\n\nThis is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc.\n\nChildrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother *twice* as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible.\n\nI know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. \n\nAn adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right.\n\nYou might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die.\n\nEDIT:\n\n/u/caw81 has slightly changed my view. Now I think only people under the age of 16 should be barred.\n\nEDIT 2:\n\n/u/incruente and /u/Zorthianator have completely changed my view.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Why can't a parent who responsibly owns and handles firearms properly supervise their child? People teach their children to do all sorts of things that COULD be hazardous, from grilling to driving to woodworking to boating and on and on and on; what makes firearms unique? Or should we just make sure no one under 18 ever gets experience or guidance doing such things?\n\nSecond Response: \nPeople under 18 often hunt, not only for sport but to help feed their families. \n\nPeople under 18 often have to defend themselves both from potential human harms and from wild animals if they live rural or remote areas. \n\nPeople under 18 are at the age that we TRAIN them in how to use things such as firearms safely.

It prompts the original poster to consider their arguments more deeply by using rhetorical questions. This approach invites dialogue rather than confronts the OP directly, suggesting a nuanced perspective on the age limit.\n- **Second Response:** This response adopts a more assertive tone, citing specific scenarios (hunting, self-defense) where under-18 individuals might need firearms. It emphasizes the potential dangers of over-regulation and the perceived lack of responsibility placed on minors, which may evoke a more defensive reaction from the OP.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques:\n- **First Response:** Uses comparative reasoning to draw parallels between firearms and other activities that risk injury (grilling, driving). This technique aims to deconstruct the OP's argument through relatable examples, encouraging a broader consideration of responsibility across age groups.\n- **Second Response:** Relies on examples of necessity\u2014hunting and self-defense\u2014which are emotionally charged and appeal to practicality.

{"index": 212, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Any life other than one of poverty is unethical.\n\nOriginal Post: \nLets start by looking at a situation:\n\nImagine you are walking by a shallow river on your way to a ball when you see a child drowning. You're wearing some pretty expensive clothes (lets say 500 pounds) that will no doubt be ruined if you jump into the river. Saving this child doesn't put you in danger as you can stand in this river while the child being smaller cannot. Do you jump into that river to save that child? \n\nLet's say you encounter that same river with a different child in it the next day while wearing your rolex watch. Do you jump into that river to save the child? \n\nNow lets look at the real world. More than 1.3 billion people live in extreme poverty (less than 80p a day) and 7.6 million children are estimated to have died before their 5th birthday in 2010. Many of these are from poverty, preventable diseases and illnesses. Money can help provide infrastructure for schools, hospitals, sanitation facilities, vaccinations etc which no doubt will help reduce child mortality rates. Once you look at the world through this lens then it is easy enough to look at the world in terms of opportunity cost. This iphone or 100 life saving vaccinations. An expensive house or cheap government housing and a new well providing water for a village. One may argue that there is a difference between the example and this and that is distance. These children are much further away but I don't see how that dilutes your moral responsibility to them. Therefore, it seems that any money that you keep must be worth a child's life, education etc or be allocated to some other duty such as child rearing where you have a responsibility to give time and money (for schools, healthcare etc) to make sure that your child grows up to be a socially productive member of society. I know that sounds like a very cold perspective on what parenting is about but i couldn't think of another way to phrase it haha.\n\nI will assume that most people think that you should save the child but this specifically is why I would save the child. I'm looking at this from the stance of virtue ethics (Aquinas) and I believe that by allowing this child to die shows a lack of charity and isn't positively building character. I can't justify losing a life in exchange for 500 pounds.\n\nBut,  I think even taken from the stance of consequentialism (believing that consequences should inform your moral thinking) or deontological ethics (believing that laws inform your moral stance) you would still reach the eventual conclusion that you must jump into that river:\n\nConsequentialism (i.e. Utilitarianism):\nYou would have to argue that having 500 pounds will lead to greater pleasure/happiness than that life and I don't think you can justify that.\n\nDeontological ethics (i.e. Kant):\nI only really understand Kant so he's the one that I will briefly (very briefly) talk about but allowing that child to die breaks the categorical imperative as if you allowed that act to become universal you would be devaluing human life by saying that it has a price tag.\n\nI've only briefly talked about why I think the child should be saved as I take it as a assumption that most people would save the child but I will be willing to discuss my ethical stance more thoroughly if anyone asks me about it but i didn't want my post to only appeal to those who have studied philosophy.\n\nThanks for your answers!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is simply not true.  Sure, money can build a school, but it won't change the fact that millions of people live in a place that can barely produce food (and is losing even that ability with a changing climate).  It doesn't change the fact that the politics of many of these regions are such that any resources sent there will immediately be confiscated by warlords.\n\nSure, my $25 could help feed someone...if the food was actually able to get to them.  But then what?  A week from now they're back in exactly the same situation.  \n\nSecond Response: \nYou could literally spend a lifetime reading the different philosophical responses that come up to this challenge, so rather than trying to formulate the argument that I think is the most convicing, I might jsut ask you which of the following arguments you think sounds most likely to convince you, and then give a basic summary of the kind of argument that ususally entails.\n\nAdditionally, I really don't think you sufficiently dealt with Kantian ethics at all (I wasn't convinced by your account of the categorical imperative, and you ignored the other components of Kantian ethics, which I actually think make a stronger case for you, specifically the second formulation), and it seems like you misunderstood virtue ethics: it isn't about maximising behaviour that conforms with a particular virtue, it's about cultivating the virtue itself. Virtue ethics demands that you are a charitable person, not that you perform maximally charitable actions. Under an Aristotelean framework (which is essentially what Aquinas operates under), it's very easy to be *too* charitable, as well, which I think is worth considering. \n\nRegardless though, some common critiques of the view your espousing would be:\n\n- It's impossible to accurately quantify 'happiness' in such a way that would allow you to make the assumptions you're making\n\n- Ethics isn't the highest thing we should aspire to\n\n- You have unique ethical responsibilities to people who are closer to you (i.e. that space is morally relevant)\n\n- Utilitarianism is heavily flawed, and your argument doesn't really work for any other major school of ethics\n\n- This position contradicts common-sense morality, which is what all moral systems aspire to emulate\n\nDo any of those sound like they could maybe change your view?\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the Second Response's deeper and more engaging inquiry into the philosophical implications of the original poster's arguments.

{"index": 213, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Using words like \"dyke\", \"faggot\", \"nigger\" etc. should not be taboo\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe reason I say this is because making those words forbidden only adds to their power, meaning that when they are used it is that much more effective. By using them in a casual way (not as an insult, but in a way similar to how people used to say \"that's so gay\") we send the message that it really isn't a big deal, which allows the word to slowly fade away from its original meaning to the point that it doesn't really have anything to do with what it once did.\n\n\nThe main thing that I draw from for this view is the word cunt. This is a pretty common insult where I used to live, though not as much in the U.S.; it basically just means jerk, and calling someone a cunt has little to do with female genitalia. If we manage to do this with words like nigger than it doesn't have to be associated with the thing it was originally connected with; in other words, it's just a generic insult that doesn't necessarily have to be associated with that group, like the word \"jerk\". \n\n\nThis isn't a view that I strongly hold, and I am fairly open to it being changed and look forward to hearing what all of you have to say in this matter.

It never seems to occur to them that their frame of reference simply can't predict what will and won't be hurtful, or that the solution \"let's just use it a lot so that you become numb to the original meaning\" isn't a good solution.\n\nI suppose that comes off as condescending. I really shouldn't do that, but this sort of thinking frustrates me. I'm a believer in descriptivist linguistics, so I understand the argument, but this is a different ball game. I could go on about normalization, discrimination and so forth, but I'd rather just talk about outcomes.\n\nIf you had asked me in the mid 2000's, when faggot and gay were really in prime use, I would have told you that it didn't really bother me. I had in fact become numb to their use. Now in 2015, it's slightly rarer to even see people saying \"that's so gay\", I can honestly say this state of language is 100% preferable to earlier. I feel better about myself, and interacting online. Becoming numb to faggot and gay wasn't a *solution*, it was a *coping mechanism*.\n\nDespite what you think, when you use those terms, *you make people feel unwanted,* not to go all Tumblr on you, but when you can reduce your negative impact on the world by such a simple act as not using obviously offensive words like Faggot or Nigger you should feel an obligation to do so.\n\nBy all means, in your close group of friends where there's no faggots or niggers to casually make feel unwanted, go nuts. Use whatever terms you like. But anywhere else, maybe be a decent person and restrain yourself a little.\n\nSecond Response: \nLet me talk about a big distinction, saying vs using. \n\nSaying a word is just uttering it. Using a word is, in the case of slurs, throwing it at people. \n\nSaying slurs for the purpose of discussing their oppressive backgrounds, their history, as part of a story or whatever else is absolutely fine, because its use in that context is not a form of oppression.\n\nUsing slurs, as in saying this words to imply negative connotation or to harass people is unacceptable. Slurs are verbal weapons, and while continued use may lessen the impact, it normalizes the idea that the target of this slur bears x qualities (usually negative \"I look like a dyke today\" \"I smell like a nigger\") This hurts the targets of these slurs, even if they're not there to hear it, by perpetuating harmful stereotypes.\n\nAlso as a gay guy who was bullied, having someone like a friend use \"faggot\" to describe someone or \"faggoty\" to describe something (again, generally to put it down) really upsets me, just how people can't bear to see knives or scissors after being attacked with one, It's hard for me to hear the word after being attacked with one, so I politely tell my friends to please tone down the slurs.\n\nThe difference here is that \"cunt\" per se targets no real demographic at this point, mainly because cunt was not a word for a person but a word for genitalia, while the other slurs you mention do target people in current memory.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post regarding the use of slurs, we can look at various stylistic elements.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\nThe **First Response** adopts a frustrated tone, implying a sense of exasperation with the original poster's mindset.

This is a tough one, because I do believe a woman shouldn't be socially pressured into taking her's husband's last name, and gay spouses also have a conundrum of their own. \n\nHowever, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.\n\nBUT, if the wife and the husband choose not to share a last name, please God settle on one name for your kid. Just flip a coin for which last name your kid takes if that's what you need to do. Don't make everyone around him have to deal with saying and writing out Reginald Henry Lieberman-Montgomery. \n\nA metaphor I would make for this would be gender pronouns. You have the right to tell me whether you identify as a man or a woman, but I swear to God if you insist that everyone around you refer to you strictly with the gender neutral pronouns Ni, Nem and Nir, I will be having none of it. \n\nAs a counterpoint, I will say that I can't ever imagine myself taking my wife's last name. And if she chose not to take mine, I think I would feel a little disappointed. Further, I can't imagine feeling comfortable with my kid not taking my last name. So I already recognize a bit of the hypocrisy. In that way, I see that I am posing a problem without an apparent solution. On top of your rebuttals, I would also be curious to hear alternative ideas/social structures that could work to level the playing field, AND prevent me from having to say a mouthful. \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nApologies for the day long delay-- car emergency took all night and all morning.\n\nThanks for all your responses! Here are some of my views you've changed. \n\nSpain &gt; 'Murica. There's a clear system in place in Spanish countries that actually speaks to my \"one family name\" point. People consistently take the fathers, then mother's surname. Then the kid's kids will do the same. Gives you family history and also something to put on your mailbox. \n\nWhat I personally like about this is that it's uniform. If two last names were adopted country-wide in America, I would have much less of a problem with it. \n\nI also want to clarify: My problem with the \"mouthful\" of hyphenated last names does not mean that I would also suggest gentrifying the Krzyzewskis and the Chevaprevadumrongs of the world. To shorten your family name is to bastardize it. No ill feelings to those with shortened last names of course-- my last name was actually gentrified two generations ago. \n\nFinally, here is a post that very well summarizes my American sentiments: \n\n&gt; While this drifts from your true argument, these lines of thinking quickly move into the larger name-choice debate, which in my experience usually boils down to \u201cPeople who name their kids something I like or understand are exercising reasonable freedom of choice. People who name their kids something I dislike or don\u2019t understand are selfish and stupid.\u201d You have not said this, but I think it is worth pointing out that are cultural biases about names are deep-seated.\n\n&gt; You want people to have choices about identity labels - - - as long as every choice is based on what you find easiest and most comfortable. If a stranger's choice is not based on your preference, they are selfish and inconsiderate. When a family you do not know fills out a birth certificate, you ask that the FIRST priority be guessing your experience if you meet their child at work in twenty years, and the SECOND priority be articulating their identity as a family in a way that feels personally appropriate.\n\nMy American sensibilities that shorter is better are deeply ingrained and will probably be there 'til I die. That said, at least I can recognize them so that I know to keep them in check. \n\nWhile I will continue to make fun of people who have two last names, it will be with the same conviction that I make fun of everyone else. No hostility here.\n\nThanks guys!\n\nFirst Response: \nI think it's useful to be able to identify a family on the basis of last names, and so I think it's useful for everyone to share the same label.\n\nAnd this is exactly why hyphenation is such a useful thing. If you meet a group of people who share the last name \"Montegue-Capulet\" then you immediately understand that they are a family unit, and you also understand something about the ancestry from both sides of the family. Additionally, hyphenation also scores points for upholding some form of gender equality.\n\nOf course, it's impractical to expect people's names to grow exponentially in size with every generation - but this doesn't have to be a problem- it's easy to resolve: when someone gets married, the son keeps only the father's name and the daughters keep only the mother's - and then they hyphenate with their spouse. We can also adopt the convention that the man's name always comes first in the hyphenation - even better - now we know both their family ties and ancestry (I don't care about how it's ordered, we just need to decide).\n\nIn summary, it only takes three names (one first, two last) to identify a person, their family unit, their family ties, and their ancestry in a complete and fair way.  Saying two last names does take longer than one, but last names are only really used for official purposes, and under formal situations. And - people are already hyphenating. I figure we may as well adopt that system as efficiently and informatively as possible.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. One small example is if you work in an industry where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind (like I do). It's helpful to know in advance who is related to who by just looking at a piece of paper.\n\nWhat about step-families with mis-matched names? \n\nOr non-married families where the mother and child have a different last name?\n\nShould we expect a child living with his/her mother to change his/her last name because their mother remarried and changed her last name?\n\n&gt; where you deal with a lot of names and families and meeting people blind \n\nHow many people work in industries where they meet people blind and need to know if they're related? My mom kept her last name and it has never been a problem in 30 years.\n\n&gt; However, I think that a family should have a family name, because otherwise you are choosing to make everyone else's life difficult. \n\nWhat about people with very confusing names? I'd say the name Smith-Jones is much easier to say than something Krzyzewski.

By doing this, it appears to engage more thoughtfully with the original post's ideas, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding the last-name debate. This responsiveness is likely to resonate more with the original poster.\n\n2. **Questioning Assumptions**: The Second Response effectively challenges the original poster's assumptions about the necessity of shared family names. By posing relevant questions about step-families and individuals with different surnames, it promotes critical thinking and illustrates the existing diversity in family structures beyond the original poster's viewpoint. This rhetorical technique encourages the original poster to reconsider their stance on whether shared last names are truly essential.\n\n3. **Depth of Argument**: The Second Response presents a broader perspective on names by touching upon scenarios that highlight exceptions to the original poster's argument. By showcasing real-world examples, such as the experiences of step-families and individuals with atypical names, it underscores that there might be no one-size-fits-all solution to naming conventions. This challenges the original poster's more rigid view.\n\n4. **Tone**: While both responses adopt a balanced tone, the Second Response seems to maintain a more respectful yet critical stance. It doesn't belittle the original poster's views but instead respectfully questions them, which can be more persuasive in changing someone\u2019s mind.\n\nIn summary, the Second Response\u2019s more effective engagement with the original poster's arguments, along with its questioning of assumptions and real-world applicability, contributed to its potential effectiveness in changing the original poster's views.", "is_correct": false}

This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.\nI believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.\n\nI understand that the state assumes the right of the child &gt; the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.\n\nOr on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.\nObviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.\n\nTL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.\n\nEDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice\", however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.\nEDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood\". \nTheScamr worded this nicely:\n&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.\n\nEDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Any questions or concerns?

But as it is, we're stuck in a tricky position- you can't demand a parent get an abortion for both ethical and practical reasons. But once a baby is born, you can't exactly euthanize unwanted babies. So who takes care of it? Well, to be fair, the people financially responsible for raising a baby have to be the ones who were responsible for making it. If one parent wants the baby and the other doesn't, I don't think it's unfair to require the other parent's financial support. \n\nThe equivalent position for a man is not pregnancy vs. child support. It's just child support vs. child support. If a mother abandons the baby and the father wants to raise it, I would say the mother is equally on the hook in this case and should pay child support. The issue is we don't see this very often, and because of how much our culture emphasizes women as child-raisers as opposed to fathers, I'm willing to bet it hasn't occurred to most people this is a thing. Importantly, though, this doesn't have much to do with abortion- once the child is born, both parents have a duty. Before a child is born, this is an issue either about ending a life or bodily integrity, and in neither case does the father have much of a say.\n\n**tl;dr**: The counterpart to absent fathers is absent mothers, who should also have to pay child support. We just don't see it happen that often. This has nothing to do with abortion. It has to do with the rights of the child.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think that ideally everything would be fair, but the reality is men and women have different bodies, meaning they have different rights. Child support is not an issue of whether or not you are going to have a child, but who should supports a living child. If parents do not want to raise a child, tough shit its not like they have the option not too (unless they both agreed to adoption). So in terms of child support after the child is born it is already on equal grounds, women have to pay child support for children that are in the fathers custody. Child support is not an issue before the child is born so lets get to what you are really asking for.\n\nWomen have the right to abort a pregnancy, men do not. This has nothing to do with child support, and your ideas of fairness only lead to a man being able to force a abortion (Obviously something no one is in favor of as you have mentioned). The choice to have a child is not the same choice as supporting the child.\n\nSo in your example you are really asking for the ability to trade the responsibility of raising a child, with the right to have a abortion. In what other legal context do we make such concessions? It really doesn't follow to make such a trade for fairness or equality. In this case you are really asking for a substitute right for one that can not be replaced.\n\nThe contradiction I see in your argument is that you want a privilege for men because women have a right.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response maintains a calm and reasoned tone while engaging directly with the original post's arguments.

{"index": 216, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: City life is hugely preferable to country/small town life\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've spent a couple of months living in the country near a small town/village, and I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone. The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:\n\n#Cities have significantly better municipal services.\n\nThe difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.\n\n#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.\n\nA really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.\n\n#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.\n\nIf you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become \"that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction.\" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can \"just spend time with the people you like,\" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.\n\n#bugs\n\nholy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa\n\n#In the country, everything is high maintenance.\n\nSince just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.\n\nFirst Response: \n I think there's a trade off for everything. You're accustomed to having everything as fast as you want it. Country people aren't. They know and accept some things are going to be a hike.\n\nIt's also possible you don't really \"hear\" the noise around you all the time like someone who hasn't grown up with it or lived in it for many years, would. Silence is golden, and if you live in an area where you can never have that, it can drive some people mad. \n\nIt's difficult to say one is \"better\" than the other. I'd vouch both have their bonuses. \n\nThe quiet, the privacy the country affords, the beauty of it. Enjoying nature, having a big garden, maybe even some farm animals. You can't do those things in the city and those things sure can keep people, very busy. \n\nThe bugs one though, come on. You know as well I do there are many cities with very nasty bug problems. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;Cities have significantly better municipal services.\n\nWhile this is true, the people who live in the country don't value these things the same way as people who live in the city. They don't care about 4G LTE, and likely don't even have a phone to utilize it. They may not like it that the city is bigger (this isn't inherently a better thing), and while you mentioned that cities are safer, I'm not so sure thats a true statement. I think crime is much more common within the city than in rural areas. Plus, people in rural areas are likely confident in their abilities to defend themselves and their families in dangerous situations, and don't necessarily want to have to depend on the municipalities for that. \n\nBasically, if you are used to living in the city, then you place value on all the things you listed about municipal services. If you live out in the country, you're used to getting by without them and they don't necessarily have the same value.\n\n&gt;Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.\n\nAgain, this is something that some people may actually see as a downside to the city. People used to living in a rural area might not like the hustle and bustle of the city, and enjoy spending recreational time doing things out in nature. People may not like malls, and they may not actually meet any like-minded people within the city.\n\n&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity\n\nThis isn't something that everybody values. Some people enjoy daily interactions with the same people, and enjoy being in a community where they are recognized and have long standing histories with people. \n\n&gt;bugs\n\nMaybe people in the country are indifferent to bugs? I don't know\n\n&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance\n\nI'm fairly sure its cheaper to live in rural areas than it is to live in the city. Even if it is true that more maintenance is required, people typically do their own maintenance and perhaps don't mind it.\n\nTL;DR People who were born in rural areas have a completely different set of values than someone born in a city. All of the things you listed as upsides to living in the city, they may see as downsides, and vice versa. Your world view is shaped by your experiences, so if your experience is living in the country, then your world view is vastly different than someone who has experienced nothing but city life.\n\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include the Second Response's deeper engagement with the original poster's points, effectively utilizing counterarguments to highlight differing values based on lifestyle. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The tone of the Second Response is more analytical and reflects an understanding of counterarguments, while the First Response is more casual and understated, focusing on general benefits of country life without engaging deeply in the original poster\u2019s arguments.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The Second Response systematically addresses each point raised by the original poster, presenting nuanced viewpoints contrasting the city and rural experiences.

Literature has a wonderful way of imparting morals - those hours spent hallucinating the words on pages in our minds seems to have a positive effect on people's feelings. So many people *identified* with the troubles of Holden Caulfield when they were younger and his reconciliation helped them reconcile something inside themselves, it did for me. Besides, fiction is a great way of expanding our knowledge of history, language, art, and much more. Reading To Kill a Mockingbird is to be taken back to another time and *live* the experience through the characters in the book.

{"index": 218, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:It is morally unjustified for me to eat lamb meat\n\nOriginal Post: \nI really want my view changed on this because I love eating lamb meat, and I would like to be able to eat it without feeling guilty!\n\nLet's start with why I find eating meat at all to be morally justifiable. I only buy meat from free-roam organic farms, which are clearly labeled here in Denmark. If I eat one of the cows I see on the outskirts of my city, happily roaming and eating grass, I don't really feel guilty. They get to experience a reasonably long, happy and healthy life. We also have pigs that are allowed to roam free in the forest. We give them a safe environment, and their lives end up on average longer and happier than they would be in the wild.\n\nSo imagine if an alien species came to earth and says: *\"Hey, we'll create a post-scarcity society for you. All your life you will be in perfect health. You (as in all humans) will never want for anything, you will get all your favorite food and you get to play video games all day or whatever it is you want to do. But when you reach the age of 50, we will kill you in a humane way and then we will eat your corpse.\"* I would find that to be a good deal. It would remove world hunger, there is no need to fight for resources. No diseases killing young people, no genetic defects. Not even having to work or do anything you don't want. And you would still get a reasonably long life to enjoy.\n\nAnd now we get to lamb meat. These guys are killed at 1 month to 1 year, which is in the best case less then 1/10th of their lives. They don't get to enjoy their lives. In my alien analogy, it would be like making the deal \"Yeah some of you get to live until 50, but some of you we will take and eat at 5\", which suddenly becomes less acceptable.\n\n**What would change my view:**\n\n* Somehow making my alien analogy work for eating humans at 5\n\n* Giving me another compelling moral argument for why eating lamb meat is ok.\n\n**What will NOT change my view:**\n\n* The \"Animals are made for human consumption so they don't matter\" argument. Well yes, but they are also intelligent agents capable of feeling pain and suffering. An alien species with superior technology and intelligence could decide that \"Humans are made for alien consumption\", and enslave our species, keeping us in cages all our lives. That would be horrible. So even if they are less intelligent and feel suffering differently, it does not give us the right to harm them for no good reason. We as a species get to decide which animals are for human consumption and which aren't, and what conditions we keep them in.\n\n* The \"we evolved to eat meat\" argument. Yes, and we can eat chicken, pork and beef. No need to eat lamb even if a vegetarian diet was insufficient. \n\nSorry for the long post. I realize it may be a bit tricky, but I really really want my guilt-free lamb roast. So there you have it, my first ever CMV :)\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for the replies! So this has been addressed from 2 perspectives, that got me to change my view:\n\n1. If we go with the alien analogy, if they were to take some human cells and clone some humans on their home world, let them play happily on a field until they are 5, and then slaughter them for food, how immoral would that really be? The children would accept it as the status-quo and enjoy their lives, as they are too young to understand all the ramifications. No parents would have to part from their children, thus causing more suffering. \n\n2. On the other side, it has been shown that other animals are slaughtered at an even younger age, so my view is inconsistent. Pigs, who are a lot more intelligent than lambs, usually get killed at 5 months. Milk cows are parted from their young as soon as they are born, and the calves get killed quite often only after a few weeks.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Cows can live twenty years (compared to human 80) - odds are who you're buying from is *somewhat* better than UK McDonalds, whose official rule is \"The age requirement for beef animals entering McDonald's supply chain is a minimum of eight months\" but most beef comes from cows under three years old. Looking to your alien example, all the beef people eat is from the equivalent of 5 to 12 year olds. If meat producers weren't being technical with their definitions, the vast majority of beef would really be called veal.\n\nSecond Response: \nA few things to consider:\n\nI think your story starts at the wrong point.  If we didn't eat lamb, the vast, vast majority of the animals used for food would never have been born.  So aliens question should really be, \"Would you rather live to be 5, romp happily around the fields, and then die, or never exist in the first place\"?\n\nHonestly, though, I think it's splitting hairs to differentiate between which humanely treated and slaughtered animals are ok to each and which aren't.  We don't need meat to survive (if we do a good job replacing it with other foods) at least in Western countries.  We do it for pleasure.  To say it's ok to eat pigs, which are far smarter than cows and sheep but not lamb doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Either you can morally justify eating meat or you can't, but, as long as there is no difference in how the animals are treated, I don't see how you differentiate morally between \"farm animals\".\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "### Comparison of Responses\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- **First Response:** The tone is somewhat confrontational and challenges the original poster\u2019s assumptions.

I think in terms of actually being useful to users, it would be nice to have some kind of flagging system for this. My main gripe is that all these sites just show you faces and user names, and you don't really know that these people aren't interested until you've already been drawn in.*\n___\n*This is based on my experience over about 4-6 months of casually using Tinder and OkC, if that helps you form any counter arguments or gives any perspective. Also, this isnt about poly relationships looking for another partner, the scope of my view doesn't even approach that.*\n\nSomething I've noticed with slightly surprising frequency on dating sites are profiles that have one of the following kinds of statements- \"Looking for friends, no commitments.\", \"My husband/boyfriend knows I have this to make friends, and I'm not going to cheat so don't bother\", \"I just moved here and thought this would be a good way to make some friends\", \"I don't take this seriously, I'm just here for the laughs, really not looking for a relationship\" ... etc...\n\nPersonally, I feel these kinds of profiles don't belong on dating sites, and only serve to come off as disingenuous or disappointing. Most dating sites just give you a series of profile pictures and names, and you choose which ones you find attractive to open up and read. The image draws you in, and then the \"Just for friends\" lets you down. To me, this is like someone attending a speed dating night at a singles bar, someone finds them very attractive and wants to see about striking up a relationship, and then they say \"Oh I only came here to maybe find some friends and enjoy people trying too hard\". If you're really looking for friends, there are places designed for platonic relationships- in the context of online communities there's places like subreddits for local towns, there's meetup.com, there's plenty of public Facebook groups for all kinds of interests, etc... \n\nGoing to a place specifically marketed to and called a dating app is just disingenuous.

I mean, why are you here, then? But, OKC lets you select \"new friends\" **as well as** \"long-term/short-term relationship/casual sex/etc.\" I've been on dates with girls who have told me that they like meeting new people and aren't adverse to remaining friends with a date that doesn't mesh romantically or sexually with them. I think the absence of a \"new friends\" preference is meant to be telling: they absolutely do not want to interact with you unless sex or a relationship is on the table.\n\nIn other words, when combined with other options, it says something about the openess of the person to different kinds of relationships. That says something about a person, to me. It is only when their preference is *exclusively* \"new friends\" that it is annoying. But I would be more inclined to date someone who had \"new friends\" in addition to other things because I feel like it makes them seem less desperate (but that's just me).\n\nSecond Response: \nWhat about people who value friendship more highly than other aspects of a relationship, and want to start on that basis?

For example, if a white-owned business wanted to deny service to all minorities, then they should be able to. As a private citizen, I can choose who I give my business to. If I'm a racist, I can choose to only give my business to my race.  If I personally want to give money to the homeless, I can choose to give it to one race/orientation/etc. or another. Why can't a private business make the same decision? The free market place should solve this problem because people would see a need to service those that are refused service and then start a competing business.\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;Why can't a private business make the same decision?\n\nBecause, when we talk about businesses, we're usually talking about conglomerates that have formally incorporated in one way or the other.  Incorporation is a creature of statute; it's created by the government.  It's more reasonable for the government to attach strings on the benefits associated with incorporation than it is to you as an individual because they're giving the business some fancy treatment.\n\nThe government hasn't bestowed any peculiar status to you, personally.  It has bestowed a status upon most businesses, who are insulated from traditional personal liability, can choose from a myriad of different tax schemes, enter contracts as a business, and so on.\n\nSecond Response: \nThis gets posted a lot.\n\nA private business is not a private citizen.\n\nYou are getting all sorts of sanctioned protections and services from the government. Protections like firefighters and police, and services like roads, distribution channels, domestic protection, etc etc.\n\nAll of these services mean that you have to enter into a general contract with the federal, state, and local governments. Part of this contract is an agreement to provide equal services to all citizens. A business can't get all the benefits of doing business in America and then just be an asshole to certain groups for no reason.\n\nIf they really want a totally \"Free\" market, they can open up in Somalia and provide all their own services, and then discriminate against whichever customers they want. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the tone and emotional approach of both responses, as well as their engagement with the original poster. \n\nThe second response employs a more direct and confrontational tone, clearly challenging the original poster's assertions about private business and discrimination.

{"index": 221, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Trump is the everyman's candidate\n\nOriginal Post: \nA friend and I were talking about the current candidates and she couldn't understand why Trump was doing so well in the polls.  The best I could articulate it is that he is the most populist candidate out, his politics are moderate but heavily nationalist, his demeanor is one of our idealized archetypes, and he is wealthy but appears genuine, achieving a halo effect (unlike Romney.)  \n\nAfter realizing this, I asked several other people, and realized that basically my friends, like Clinton, don't like how he communicates, but then have no major disagreement with the content.\n\nAm I missing something?  Is there a good reason to dismiss him as a candidate?  More importantly, who is real competition for him?\n\n***EDIT****\nFrom todays conversations:\nI see an argument for why he may not have a good chance in an election (delta awarded), mainly in that whatever percentage of his 25% popularity is republican is all he may get from the republicans, and as a more mainstream candidate arises, the split votes wont go to him (that is, the people who polled for him may be all that would poll for him in the primary, given any other more mainstream republican candidate.\n\nHowever, I have seen no compelling argument for why he is not a populist candidate.  Some have tried to narrow the definition of a populist to being representative of a position or policies that in some fashion clearly serve the underserve or/and the majority, but this is difficult to define, and ignores the perception.  One person argued at length that the self perception of the constituency as victim and the candidate's policy being to address that sense of victimization is what makes them populist, and while I can agree that it is a fine definition, the person then asserts that this is not trump, and I disagree, as Trump clearly paints the American people as victimized by poor, self interested leadership, a corrupt political culture, and compromised ideas and strategies, and his entire platform is about going in as a normal private citizen and fixing it.\n\nMany (most?) have simply tried to argue that he is too insulting to win, but I remain unconvinced that that would stop a sizable percentage of Americans from voting for him.  This is because Americans don't actually value formality and decorum as much as power and conviction.  For the same reason that this is the America we have, I can't see how a candidate, fundamentally in favor of current nationalist policies, but simultaneously harping on being free from big money interests and the many leadership deficits that are frustrating Americans, isn't hitting so many of the right cords with mainstream America.\n\nIf he sticks to a policy (rather than sentiment,) that is antithetical to a group, then another would be preferred by that group.  But a career politician vs Trump, both speaking in vagaries, I see Trump coming out on top rather consistently.  (Saw a headline today, Trump took a hit in polls for being in favor of higher taxes, this looks like an example of the very thing.)\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

He doesn't care if he comes across as abrasive or bigoted.    He also doesn't care if what he proposes makes any sense (building a Mexican wall and making Mexico pay for it, for instance).\n\nThere are some who find this outspokenness appealing (such as those who liked Sarah Palin).\n\nBut his problem is that he doesn't appeal to enough Republicans to get the nomination.  The Christian Right doesn't think he's really Christian (because, well, he isn't).  The Tea Partiers don't think he's really their guy either (because he isn't).  The mainstreamers don't think he's mainstream (because he isn't).  \n\nAt the end of the day, he might draw enough to be a spoiler in some early races (and maybe win a plurality), but once the other vote splitters drop out, a Jeb Bush or Scott Walker will appeal a lot more to primary voters.\n\nThe biggest scare for Repubs is whether he'll run as a 3rd party candidate.  In that case, he'll get enough votes to ensure a win by the Dems.\n\nSecond Response: \nWe're at an extremely polarized point in our nation's history and I think a lot of the dismissal comes from the fact that he's simply in the \"other\" party.  Democrats have branded him racist, sexist, etc. but is there a Republican they're not *also* branding as those things?  \n\nTrump gets an extra heap of dismissal because he's also not exactly a Republican either.  There are a lot of people in the party who have a strong interest in making sure an outsider doesn't take the reigns. \n\nI think Jeb Bush is still his biggest competition overall.  Trump is the front runner because ridiculously early polling has him ahead but polling this early is notoriously unreliable and campaigning hasn't really started yet.  He's going to have to come up with a platform at some point to run on.\n\nI wouldn't exactly call him a populist.  He certainly says some things some people want to hear but I think it's probably more accurate to call him the candidate for those fed up with career politicians.  Trumped up controversial statements have made headlines but I think his man attraction still is that he's an extremely successful businessman and not a guy who ran for his father's Senate seat 40 years ago. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response distinguishes itself by addressing the original poster's viewpoint with a more analytical and situationally aware tone.

{"index": 222, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The black community is perpetuating stereotypes and self-segregating itself.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI am a young black male, who is torn between both sides of the aisle regarding race relations in America. \n\nI have experience racial profiling and understand that there is a prevalent problem with minorities -- specifically African-Americans and Latinos receiving lengthier prison sentences and disproportionately being targeted by law officials. \n\nI also understand that my experiences do not relate to all of the black community. By that I mean, just because I was able to make it out of the 'hood' doesn't necessarily mean every black person is awarded that opportunity. \n\n\nHowever I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight. \n\nObviously I'm not going to be able to go into deep analysis of my views but I'll try touch on some view points.\n\n* Mindset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack people throughout American history have been disproportionately impoverished, and throughout the last 30 years have developed a mindset of \"hustlin\". Now I understand that \"hustlin\" can translate into any race/culture as just another medium in which to get money. But black culture seems to value poverty and the 'hustlers mentality'. If I turn on the radio to HOT107.5, I am very likely to find the radio announcer perpetuating this stereotype. \"Hustlin'\"  is glorified while education is not. \n\nThere is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty. \n\nHip-hop is attached to black culture, and it seems that black culture (which has churned out great literary works and ideas) cannot distance itself from hip-hop. I don't believe hip-hop is bad. Quiet the opposite, but it is the black community that has embraced the hip-hop scene and made the world associate it with us &amp; crime/street life. Even TV shows portray this, everything from sitcoms to drama. You are less likely to find the token-black guy, and more likely to find the 'reformed thug'. \n\nBlack people want to be included in mainstream society, yet reject it at the same time. We want to have black casts in popular TV series or movie franchises, but we also want black-only things. I believe you can't have your cake and eat it too. America works best as a soup, not a salad. \n\nThe black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\n/r/blackpeopletwitter, albeit funny, is also embarrassing because black people are again perpetuating a stereotype or being cast a stereotype. Tweets about is 'how fire is my mixtape, 'bruh' 'nigga this, nigga that'. We have normalized it to the point weere teenage white girls are saying \"nigga\" and \"bitch\" like it's a pronoun. Political action by black tweeters seems to also alienate other groups of people. The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\" \n\n\n* Black nationalism\n\nIn my eyes, black nationalism is dangerous because it perpetuates a lot of misinformation and half truths. It is on the scale as 'white washing' history. Social media has become a breeding ground for misinformation by/for the black community. Black nationalism will ultimately lead to polarizing the nation.\n\ni.e. \"Ancient Egyptians were black, Jesus was black, Mohammed was black, etc\" or teaching talking about slavery only in terms of black v. white. \n\n\n* Homophobia/Racism/Misogyny\n\nAs I stated earlier, the black community hasn't made a very active attempt in stemming the mindset that mainstream hip-hop culture perpetuates. All I can tell you is from my own experience but homophobia and misogyny  seems to be rampant in the black community. Not so much in terms of violent actions but insults through social media and subtle homophobic/misogynistic remarks made on radio and TV. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nI think your analysis failed to address the historical roots of your points. You don't address where the stereotypes originated, you don't discuss the long term generational effects poverty and mass incarceration have on communities, and you fail to realize how social media has allowed for the dissemination of information on issues black communities face to non-black communities. \n\n&gt;\"Hustlin'\" is glorified while education is not.\n\nWell, this is what happens when you have an education system that has time and time again failed black communities in urban areas. I highly recommend listening to [this](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) episode of This American Life. It touches on the huge discrepancies between the education white kids receive and black kids receive in St. Louis but it's just one example that can be applied to urban communities across the country. \n\n &gt;However I also believe that police brutality should not be the pressing issue within the (urban) black community. I believe that the black community is a ''riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma''. And that movements like Black Lives Matter only polarize the country. The American consciousness does not change overnight.\n\nPolice brutality is another example of how a system that is meant to protect people fails to protect black communities. I don't understand why you think it's not important to address. Mike Brown's case is not only a case of a white cop killing a black boy, but an example of economic and social disparities in white and black neighborhoods. Black Lives Matters isn't about polarizing the country. Why should this issue even be polarizing? That's the main problem. Why are people still arguing that systemic racism isn't an issue in this country? That's what BLM protestors are trying to move away from - we aren't arguing anymore that race is a problem in this country, right now we're trying to address the problems of the institutions in this country. And to be honest it is working. After the two BLM protestors shut down Bernie Sander's event what happened? He released his platform on racial justice and has talked about mass incarnations and the issues of private prisons in this country. \n\nI think you barely grazed the surface with your analysis. It's important to look into the psychological effects systemic racism has on communities. Black communities don't trust the very institutions you think we should trust (education, police force, etc). Saying black communities should cooperate and let go of very important aspects of our culture (hip-hop, music, sports) is in and of itself oppressive. Black people in this country were never given the power to address these issues for themselves, they weren't even considered people since the day they were brought to this country, because of this we have to rely on our communities to fight for ourselves and make these issues more heard. [Here's](http://www.thenation.com/article/black-lives-matter-is-a-demand-not-a-plea/) a piece that highlights why that is important. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nWow, there is a lot to respond to here.  I'll start out by tackling it point by point.\n\n&gt; There is very little initiative towards the Arts, STEM, etc. Sports/athleticism seems to be the major avenue to which black people feel they can ascend from poverty.\n\nFirst off, sports are actually one of the more genuinely meritocratic institutions in this country.  Although realistically most black people will never become professional athletes, sports in school often come with requirements to maintain a certain GPA, and there are a variety of scholarships that colleges offer for athletes.  This is a minor nitpick, but it's not wrong to suggest sports can help some black people out of poverty.\n\nBut that's a minor point.  More importantly, the idea that black people just don't value education is wrong.  Empirically, factually wrong.  [Here is a very interesting article on the subject](http://www.theroot.com/articles/politics/2013/01/acting_white_theory_black_academic_achievement_based_on_other_factors.html), discussing whether or not black people have a disdain for education and view it as \"acting white.\"  What the various studies cited in the article found is that black students value education as much or even slightly more than their white counterparts.  Black students were more likely to report that their friends wanted them to go to college, a majority of all black students personally plan to go to college, and by far the most common reason for not going was being unable to afford it.  Black people were even slightly more likely to consider high-achieving students \"cool\", and a greater proportion of black people said that their friends would be supportive if they received good grades than white people.  To quote the article:\n\n&gt; For more than three decades, researchers have found that black students consistently exhibit more positive attitudes about education than white students, contrary to their lower levels of academic achievement.\n\nThis raises the question about why black academic achievement is lower.  One possibility is that schools in black neighborhoods have much less funding and larger class sizes that make individualized attention difficult.  Another could be a feeling of being unsafe, which, the linked article notes, is correlated with decreased academic achievement.  \"Stereotype threat\", a phenomenon noted by Claude Steele and discussed at length in his book *Whistling Vivaldi*, describes the way anxiety about confirming a stereotype can result in worse performance on a given task.  Whatever the reason(s), it is not \"black culture\".\n\nNow, on to another argument of yours, OP:\n\n&gt; The black community has yet to tackle black on black crime, yet it sees police brutality as more important. We HATE to be labeled as thugs, criminals, yet social media has only made our stereotypes more transparent.\n\nRates of violent crime are higher in black communities than white ones.  The problem is that viewing crime in the lens of \"personal responsibility\" or otherwise simply blaming criminals, punishing them, and calling it a day, is intellectually bankrupt and morally irresponsible.  And chalking it up to some vague \"black culture\" and then flooding the neighborhood with cops is certainly not a rational response.  Asking why black on black crime is a problem is a legitimate question, however.  Let's investigate.\n\nFirst, most violent crimes are intraracial- white people are generally more likely to kill other white people, and black people are generally more likely to kill other black people.  You've likely heard this point before so I won't spend much time on it.\n\nOf course, you can counter that black people still commit higher rates of violent crime, and you would be right.  However, the explanation is not as simple as \"black culture\".  [According to one study](http://ann.sagepub.com/content/623/1/93.short):\n\n&gt; Using data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study to examine the racial-spatial dynamic of violence for neighborhoods in thirty-six U.S. cities, the authors demonstrate that along with the social and economic conditions that exist within neighborhoods, proximity to more disadvantaged and especially racially privileged (heavily white) areas is particularly critical in accounting for the large and visible differences in violence found across neighborhoods of different colors.\n\n[Another study](http://law.ku.edu/sites/law.drupal.ku.edu/files/docs/law_review/v57/7.0-Peterson_Final.pdf) finds that \"gross rates of violence are two and a half to five times greater in the three types of non-white neighborhoods than in white areas (Figure 5), but these differences drop to a maximum of one and three quarters after critical community conditions are taken into account (Table 2).\"  These critical community conditions?  Differences in access to external resources (such as home loans) and socioeconomic disadvantages.\n\n[A different study](http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/93.short) finds that unemployment and underemployment are significantly correlated with willingness to commit crime.  [Black unemployment rates are consistently roughly twice white unemployment rates.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/08/21/through-good-times-and-bad-black-unemployment-is-consistently-double-that-of-whites/)  [A white criminal and a black person without a criminal record have roughly the same chance of being hired.](http://csgjusticecenter.org/reentry/posts/researchers-examine-effects-of-a-criminal-record-on-prospects-for-employment/)  It's nearly impossible for black people with criminal records to get jobs, and with the War on Drugs, large numbers of black people have been swept up into the criminal justice system as felons, and permanently denied access to the economy.  Between violent criminals and nonviolent drug offenders, 1/3 of black men will be incarcerated at some point in their lives, which means 1/3 of black men will be disadvantaged in finding employment, and more likely to commit crime as a result.\n\nYou say the black community needs to tackle black on black crime.  And I agree!  It needs to tackle black on black crime by addressing it at its sources- mass incarceration, poverty, lack of services, police brutality, and segregation.  But of course, we have movements dealing with those issues.  One such movement is #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nAnyway, moving on:\n\n&gt; The issue of police brutality for example seems to be marketed/targeted as a black-only issue. Again, creating polarizing opinions/slogans like \"All Lives Matter\"\n\nIt is true that white people are often victims of police brutality and mass incarceration.  It's also true that black people are disproportionately victims of those things.  And another thing that is true: black people are more likely than white people to even acknowledge that a problem exists.  By calling attention to a problem white people largely don't want to realize exists, a problem born from post-civil rights movement racism masquerading as a concern for \"law and order\", of course BlackLivesMatter is going to be polarizing.  But it needs to be BlackLivesMatter because of the racist origins of our current system of mass incarceration, the disproportionate police brutality, and the havoc racism continues to inflict on black communities.  To ignore the racial aspects of our current police brutality problem is to fall short of being able to fix it and the system around it.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "After analyzing the two responses to the original post, I predict that the second response successfully changed the original poster's view.\n\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Prediction\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a tone that is both assertive and engaging.

Long-term, a unified Korea would turn into an economic powerhouse. We have two countries with very strong work ethics, a country with a ton of technological advancements and billionaire tech companies, another country with a ton of cheap labor (that can help jump start the economy after unification), lots of natural resources that would offset the costs, and infrastructure that must be built in the northern half of the peninsula.

It's easy to say this so casually when your entire way of life and your actual life itself is not what's at risk. A war with North Korea could trigger some very hard times for both North and South. Any economic benefits to be reaped would likely be in the long term. It's easy to call for sacrifice when you are not the one sacrificing. Who is to say unification will save lives? Violent, forced unification might cause extreme civil unrest, decades of terrorism, and continued or even accelerated loss of life on both sides. Unifying through full on war and unifying post-North Korean collapse are very different prospects that entail different likelihoods of success.\n\n2. That is true. Many experts predict that unification could be an economic boon. The same Goldman Sachs report that you are unknowingly referencing also states that this is under the assumption of most optimal circumstances (i.e. gradual and peaceful reunification). That circumstance is only most likely post natural internal North Korean collapse and not through violent takeover. North Korea is not ready to be a stable state if taken over.\n\n3. 60 years of consisted foreign policy doesn't change overnight. Their greatest concerns aren't cultural ones and more military. China, despite being a large coastal country, is landlocked militarily speaking by two great island chains - both of which are, in one way or another, under US control. The Korean peninsula is part of these chains (they form the mainland connection to the islands). North Korea falling further exacerbates America's cornering of China. It's a militarily strategic concern more than anything.\n\nAgain, I think it's important to emphasize this. It's easy to be hawkish when it's not your life that's being thrown away. Some things to keep in mind.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The Second Response has a more empathetic tone by directly recognizing the potential impact of war on the original poster's life, saying \"it's easy to say this so casually when your entire way of life and your actual life itself is not what's at risk.\" This engagement opens a more profound emotional discussion, inviting the original poster to consider the human cost of war more deeply.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The Second Response uses a structured approach by addressing each point made by the original poster one-by-one. This clear, logical rebuttal shows that the responder is not only listening but also critically engaging with the arguments presented, which can encourage the original poster to reflect on their views. The First Response, while also structured, does not engage as directly with the poster's specific arguments.\n\n3. **Depth of Argumentation**: The Second Response elaborates on potential outcomes of unification and challenges assumptions about economic benefits and stability post-reunification. This depth of analysis invites the original poster to reconsider their stance thoroughly, essentially prompting a more significant re-evaluation of their initial post. The First Response argues that war would be detrimental but does not as strongly counter the original poster's optimistic view of long-term reunification. \n\nOverall, the Second Response's combination of empathy, depth, and structured engagement is more likely to change the original poster's view compared to the more dismissive and straightforwardly defensive approach of the First Response.", "is_correct": true}

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I think this is the case for a lot of people. My boss friended me at one point, which I thought was awkward because whenever I'm in a leadership position I don't friend anyone because I don't want them to feel pressured into saying yes. Anyway. My boss used to talk to me (in person)about things I had posted online and events I had gone to, and it was almost like him seeing my Facebook made him feel like he knew me well and we were buddies. And I know I gave him access to that information, but I thought it was creepy that he cared.\n\nAnd that's what it comes down to. Yeah you are entitled to look through my post history, but WHY do you even care? I think that's what makes it creepy. \n\nSecond Response: \nIt's one thing to notice a pic a friend posted on their wall.  It is creepy when a guy targets someone he doesn't know well and he reads every single post put up for years.   It's the obsession.  It's the depth at which that one person digs through another's life.\n\nSure it's public.   Technically your trash can at the curb can become public and be searched.   But it's *creepy* to know someone is digging through you scraps to find out things about you.    It's never for a good purpose.   It makes the owner feel very uncomfortable to be so thoroughly investigated.

The responder shares a personal anecdote that addresses the feeling of discomfort when someone else has access to your information, showing empathy.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** The response uses personal experience to illustrate a common scenario, which makes the argument relatable. By discussing their own feelings towards their boss using their posts, they effectively illustrate a boundary.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The sentences are relatively short and straightforward, making them easy to follow. There is a clear structure in which the author first presents their situation, then explains their feelings about it.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** The responder acknowledges the original poster's perspective by recognizing the distinction between public posts and the feelings involved, showcasing understanding of the complexities in social media interactions.\n\n### Second Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is a bit more serious and formal. There\u2019s a stronger emphasis on the unpleasantness of being overly scrutinized, which evokes a sense of discomfort.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** This response contrasts the act of seeing a friend\u2019s post versus deeply researching someone.

However, learning Mandarin Chinese, Japanese or Korean is more valuable than learning any European language.\n\n\n-Travel\n\nIt's easier for Europeans to learn English and harder for East Asians to learn English.\nMost Europeans at the very least speak basic English, and most East Asians only know English words.\nYou can travel across Europe only knowing English, but in East Asia it helps more to know the language.\nI don\u2019t consider places like South America and China to be developed enough to travel through, other than tourist spots catering to English speakers.\n\n\n-Media\n\nWhen it comes to media, East Asian countries have their own isolated worlds. Going through their music, films, television and books can almost feel like visiting an alien world since so little reaches the west. \nSpecifically Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses and understand the importance of [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and as a means produce a lot more films, music, games, comics, literature and TV than any European or South American country.\n\n\n-Availability\n\nEuropean languages have more speakers than East Asian languages, but most Europeans already speak English.\n\nFor an American there may be a lot Latin American immigrants, but there are Asian immigrants everywhere in the world.\n\nEast Asian languages might not be as widely available, but their populations are educated, travel a lot, and have [more native speakers than other European languages.](http://i.imgur.com/SDrGTr8.jpg)\n\n\n-Difficulty\n\nEast Asian languages are said to be notoriously hard by Europeans, but with technology in just the recent years it has become a lot easier. Chinese characters, hangul and Japanese writing systems can now be learned on your smartphone by playing games with apps like memrise or anki.\n\nA lot of European-language speakers complain about how complex European grammar tends to be, whereas East Asian grammar often is \u201clogical\u201d and straight to the point (with exceptions, as any language). \nIf you disclude writing systems, East Asian languages would be easier to learn as a spoken language than European ones for someone who has experience with neither.\n\n\n-Cultural benefits\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if their worlds are isolated from ours.\nLearning a widely different language helps us understand the structures of our own languages. Learning about a completely different culture helps us understand the uniqueness of our own culture. \n\nEuropean cultures are often so similar that we only tend to think of simple things as being differentiating between countries, but what makes us unique as westerners becomes much more apparent when compared to a country at the other side of the world.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There is value in learning a language that you can use, there is less value in learning a language that you won't use. \n\nIn the case of an European, (I'm taking the Dutch as an example) \nGermany is our biggest trading partner, there is value in learning German for economic reasons. Germany is bordering to us, increasing the amount of times we meet, there is value in learning German for social reasons, like vacations or friendships. which isn't there for Asian languages, because the people aren't vacationing that often in Asian countries as they do in our neighbouring countries. People that we meet in Europe often can speak an european language, even the ones that have origins in Asia, so it is easier to just keep to learning European languages if you are planning to stay inside of Europe. \n\nOne of the best ways to learn a new language is immersion. It is easier to do so in Europe as an European. We have English, French and German as language options on TV for example. And if TV isn't enough we can just travel a few hours and go to a country where the language is spoken. While there is barely any chance to immerse yourself in Asian languages the same way.\n\n\nSecond Response: \nHere is the small problem. it is far easier for a Chinese person to learn fluent English than a western to learn any level of fluent Chinese. \n\nWhen those two meet, guess what the language will be?\n\nEnglish. \n\nI don't really advocate that it is better to learn Spanish than Mandarin, but I would say that there are a lot of people in China who know a little bit of Mandarin that are getting out compete by Chinese who speak English a lot better than westerns speak Mandarin. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response maintains a respectful and informative tone throughout, emphasizing the practical benefits of learning a European language while acknowledging the original poster's viewpoint.

{"index": 226, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: We need to develop alternative energy capabilities, but that shouldn't include an expansion of nuclear power.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically many more people are killed by other forms of energy generation (I believe!). That's not to say that this isn't a worry, on some level. It's just not my top worry.\n\nI am, however, concerned about nuclear waste. The goal of developing alternative energies, to my mind, is to reduce our environmental footprint and save our ecosystem as we know it. Sure, we might slow global warming using nuclear energy - but to my knowledge, we don't really have any good way of dealing with nuclear waste. Investing in nuclear energy is just a way of trading one environmental problem for another.\n\nSecond, other forms of renewable energy are increasingly cost-effective and efficient. There's no reason to be generating nuclear power when we can do just as well with other forms of energy.\n\nThird, nuclear energy is an international conundrum. If we could move away from nuclear energy in the United States and invest globally in other forms of renewable resources, we would be able to prove, in some small way, that nuclear energy programs are unnecessary - and, therefore, give us more leverage to refuse to tolerate them in diplomatic talks.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We shouldn't give up on nuclear energy, we should instead invest in something like this.\n\nOther forms of renewable energy are NOT cost-effective or efficient. Solar power plants get less and less effective the farther away you go from the equator, and transporting electricity is a problem, as more of it is lost with distance. Even with very high voltages, significant power loss over long distances is unavoidable. \nWind farms take a significant amount of resources to construct and maintenance is very expensive (they also have a tendency to kill birds, which can be problematic, especially near coastlines, which also happens to be where wind turbines are most cost-effective, due to strong winds and reasonable accessibility). Geothermal and Hydroelectricity depend on location a lot so they're not viable everywhere. Furthermore hydroelectricity has a tendency to ruin the environment too, for example read about Chinese hydroelectricity plants and the effects damming rivers have had on the river deltas there. Check their respective wikipedia pages for more details.\n\nA lot of things can be proven to not be necessary, strictly speaking (cars, internet, etc.) but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to get rid of them, and even if the US would get rid of them, it wouldn't convince anyone else. I think the US has enough leverage in international politics without this.\n\nSecond Response: \nFirst, you're right that [nuclear energy kills far less people than the resulting pollution from other energy forms](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2012/06/10/energys-deathprint-a-price-always-paid/).  \n\nSecond, there's never going to be a perfect solution to dealing with nuclear waste, but containment and sequestration are very good options.  \n\nThird, there are problems with other alternative energy sources that make Nuclear energy a good compliment to it.  Hydroelectric power is somewhat limited in its scope, and not available everywhere.  Solar and wind power can be somewhat seasonal, are not ideal everywhere, and solar energy obviously is not effective at night or in cloudy conditions.  Nuclear energy can help fill the gaps.  Also, solar and wind energy are not easily scaleable - if there's a surge, you can increase the power of a nuclear generator to compensate, we can't turn up the wind.  We could also compensate with batteries, but batteries typically have a pretty significant environmental footprint as well, and paying for huge amounts of energy generators and batteries together would be even steeper in terms of cost.  \n\nFourth, nuclear energy is ready... now!  That's a big deal.  We keep improving solar generators, and wind power is becoming more attractive, but nuclear energy is a very safe option with a proven track record (albeit a scary reputation) and has been around for decades.  \n\nFinally, regarding the international conundrum - the US still has a ton of nuclear weapons.

When the fridge is on the bottom of the unit and not the top, most average-sized people have to bend down to see what's inside, which is less than ideal.\n\n2. Freezer on bottom allows you to make use of a sliding drawers arrangement like [this](http://www.ajmadison.com/ajmadison/images/items_large/mbb1956open.jpg) rather than an open door arrangement like [this.](http://appliances.retailcatalog.us/products/196600/62159open.jpg)\n\n  The former arrangement gives you greater access to more shelf space, since you will never have to reach around something to get at something else at the back of the freezer, you can just slide the drawer out and grab it off the top.\n\n3. ~~If the power goes out, you want the things that need to stay the coldest to be on the bottom.

The way fridges are designed, all the cooling takes place in the freezer. There is a thermocouple in the fridge measuring the temperature. When the fridge reaches a certain temperature, a vent opens between the two compartments to let the cold air into the fridge section. If the freezer is on top, the air will flow freely downwards due to the denser cold air displacing the warmer air in the fridge. If the freezer is on the bottom, a fan is needed to drive the exchange. It will be more expensive to operate. \n\n\nThat being said, I have a bottom freezer and I find the convenience outweighs the extra cost.\n\nSecond Response: \nI generally agree with you, but you are wrong on point #3.\n\n&gt; If the power goes out, you want the things that need to stay the coldest to be on the bottom. Heat rises, and so it makes sense to keep the frozen items on the bottom so that if your power goes out, they will stay cold the longest.\n\nHeat rises to the top *within a closed system*.

The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.\n\nCalling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, \"Look! I've created a bookbottle!\"\n\nThe object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.\n\nUnunpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.\n\nChange my view.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. \n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n&gt;Short half life\n\nIt's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.\n\n&gt;Very few atoms at a time\n\nThis is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.\n\n&gt;Not outside the lab.\n\nWhere it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.\n\nThere are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion.\n\nFirst Response: \nYou've already addressed a bunch of points here, but I don't think anyone's yet addressed the Island of Stability, a proposed group of superheavy isotopes (possibly around element 126ish) with extraordinary stability relative to their neighbors (no telling whether they'll be able to exist on a macroscopic scale).\n\nIf you decided to declare more ephemeral nuclides \"not elements\" (a view I am very glad you have abandoned), then you're cultivating an artificial gap between stable natural elements and \"stable\" transuranics.\n\nSecond Response: \nIf we can make them then it's highly probable that there are natural processes that can also produce them. The problem is that we very rarely see or can measure the conditions that might possibly produce them. So, we don't (rather, can't with current capabilities) know if, when, and where these things might exist in nature.\n\nI know it strokes our ego to think that these things are completely artificial and could only possibly exist due to human activity, that is probably not the case.

{"index": 230, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The U.S. government is completely untrustworthy and giving in more power is insane.\n\nOriginal Post: \nNow in the spirit of fairness - I believe this to be true for all governments, but in this case I'll touch upon the U.S. gov.\n\nFirst of all [Lusatania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Lusitania#Undeclared_war_munitions) the U.S. government deliberately loaded a civilian ship with munitions, so that the German can sink it and the population be dragged into a war they wanted nothing to do with.\n\nSecond - [Gulf of Tonkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident#Later_statements_about_the_incident) where the government lied about  engaging enemy targets, in order to stimulate the population into supporting the Vietnam War. \n\nThird - [Nayirah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah) testified before congress to encourage U.S. into entering the Gulf War\n\nForth - [MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra) is a thing.\n\nAfter this, how can anyone trust the government in any way? It's insane to give it more power.   \n\nFirst Response: \nI'll agree that the government has proven itself untrustworthy multiple times, but it also can be counted on for certain things. As far as I know, people get their welfare checks on time. The police respond when people call them. The fire department doesn't refuse or neglect to put out fires.\n\nI do think that the government shouldn't be given carte blanche, and they probably have too much power, so shouldn't have more, but I don't think it's entirely untrustworthy, as you claim.\n\nSecond Response: \nFirst, you said that \"this is true for all governments,\" meaning, I suppose, that you believe every government body is untrustworthy.  Since systems of government vary so wildly from country to country, from parliamentary democracies to theocracies to dictatorships, it can't be a specific form or kind of governance that you identify as the source of this problem, so that suggests you find a kind of illegitimacy in government by definition.  In other words, no government is capable of behaving in a way that you deem \"trustworthy\" because there is something inherently untrustworthy about the idea of government.\n\nIn order to address that concept, we have to agree about what sort of trustworthiness we're talking about, and since you repeatedly link the two, how this trustworthiness relates to the concept of government power.  It sounds to me like you are talking about the trust that a nation's citizens should be able to place in their government, which sounds reminiscent of the idea of the [social contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract) that supposedly exists between a government and the governed, a tacit agreement that citizens cede some power to a central authority in exchange for some benefits, such as national security, economic protection, and the general pursuit of the nation's interests above others.  Now, we can't argue here about some forms of the social contract being better or more legitimate than others--this isn't going to turn into a Hobbes vs. Rousseau debate--because you've already stated that you believe every government is \"untrustworthy,\" which I'm here parsing as \"unable or unwilling to fulfill its end of the social contract.\"   \n\nNow, I get the feeling that maybe this isn't so much about the social contract stuff at all.  As far as upholding its agreement to pursue its own citizens' interests above all others, it's arguable that the United States was doing just that even while committing the acts you've described.  This sounds more like a criticism of the opacity of our government--that sometimes it willfully misleads its citizens, that we're being manipulated, propagandized, and lied to by our government.  Here, I would concede that this is true, to some extent, of all governments: that sometimes, in order to maintain its legitimacy or increase popular support for what it feels to be the best course of action, every government uses \"spin\" to push forward certain agendas.  This is true both in modern democracies and in medieval feudal systems, because the government, if it wishes to last, needs its citizens to at least believe it is acting with real authority.  You might counter that, if the government needs people to trust its legitimacy, the best way to do that is to be entirely honest with them, and that's a great idea in theory, but in practice, a number of obstacles prevent this.  For one, different parts of the government need to have access to information that, in order to truly protect the interest of its citizens, must be held to the utmost secrecy.  The CIA can't let the media know every time it's started to hunt down a suspected espionage scheme, the FBI can't announce publicly that they're tracking the movements of a terrorist cell, the IRS can't broadcast that they suspect a large company has committed fraud before they have proof.  Certain vital functions of the government would cease to work entirely if forced to be transparent, and would in fact become counterproductive to the well-being of the nation.  It's true that these more covert aspects of government function can be used as a smokescreen by unscrupulous individuals or interests, but that's not *why* they exist.\n\nAnother scenario where obfuscation often arises is more in line with the events you mention as examples of government untrustworthiness.  Sometimes, the government needs popular support for a course of action it wants to pursue, but knows that the cause won't get that support on its own, so it manufactures a casus belli.  But why, in these cases, did the government's opinion of the best course of action diverge from the public's?  Often the problem is that the political framework of experts just doesn't translate to everyday people, who wouldn't accept the political reality of our world even when it is explained to them.  To use your WWI example, with hindsight it is easy to condemn the whole of WWI as a pointless, needlessly brutal war that never should have been fought, but imagine you're in the position of America after Europe has already entered into the war.  Now that many of your allies and trade interests are engaged in this conflict, it's going to affect you to one degree or another.  There are a huge range of motivations for American exceptionalism, from pacifism to xenophobia, but there are also motivations for entering the war.  One, it will improve the odds that the side your support actually succeeds, and it bolsters your relationship with your allies and to some extent, makes them indebted to you.  Two, it might hasten the end of the conflict, which could be considered a humanitarian win--even though your entering the fray will certainly result in some suffering and loss of life that otherwise would not have happened, it might mean less suffering and loss of life *overall*.  Three, war is generally good for the home economy, as it stimulates spending and development in many industries.  Also, at the time, there was a certain interest in both increasing US influence abroad and hopefully preventing future conflicts by starting an international peacekeeping force, which America could legitimately present only if they'd had a dog in the fight.  But these reasons are very big-picture, dry, and long-term, and everyday citizens often don't respond well to reasons like this.  They don't have the education or background, many times, to consider these arguments fairly.  What they respond to much more is overt patriotic overtures, emotional displays, and singular catalyzing events as the spurs for action.  This is why nations manufacture events like the Lusitania as a casus belli.  Also I should point out that your summary of that event is not in line with the link you provided--the conspiracy theory states that the **British** purposefully allowed the Germans to destroy the ship in order to bring the US into the war, but regardless, since the Lusitania sank in 1915 and the US didn't enter the war until 1917, its use as a rallying point for US engagement can still be seen as propagandizing rather than a legitimate primary motivation for the US entering the war.\n\nNow, we have to address what you mean by \"giving the government more power,\" but I'm going to break this into two parts because this has turned into a really long comment...\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include the following:\n\n1. **Depth of Engagement**: The second response engages deeply with the original poster's arguments, dissecting them and offering a nuanced analysis that touches on theoretical concepts like the social contract.

{"index": 231, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The reason people don't listen to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music does not usually contain a drum set.\n\nOriginal Post: \nAs a lifelong classical musician, I am absolutely in love with the repertoire of symphony orchestras, opera, and chamber music. I am always trying to think of ways to introduce the music to a wider audience and get more people to love listening to classical music. \n\nSo here it is: I believe that the main reason people don't like listening to classical music as much as other genres is because classical music rarely includes a drum set. \n\nDefinitions I use in this CMV: \n\nClassical music: not only music from the classical period. I'm using the blanket term to describe any music typically performed by orchestras, or chamber ensembles. What a non-musician would think of as \"classical.\" Everything from Bach to Mahler to Bartok to Ives. \n\nPopular music: not just the narrow genre of \"pop,\" but the broad term to include anything listened to by a more mainstream audience. Could include anything from oldies, to country, to EDM, to metal, and beyond. \n\nNow to explain my view:\n\nI really don't think there's that much difference between classical music and other genres. \n\n-Both genres use the same 12 notes. (The exception obviously being microtonal classical music, which even as a career classical musician, sometimes I have a really hard time appreciating. But 99.9% of classical music uses the same 12 notes as popular music.)\n\n-Both use the same basic palette of harmonies and tonalities (major/minor chords, added 7ths, 9ths, etc.). \n\n-Both have the same basic choices of meters. (4/4 time, mixed meter, etc.)\n\n-Both use many of the same instruments. (Guitars aren't exclusive to popular music, and violins and 'celli aren't exclusive to orchestras.)\n\n-Both contain pieces with text/lyrics, and both genres also contain pieces that are purely instrumental. (A lot of people point to lyrics as the main reason they love certain genres of popular music, but both genres have music with text/lyrics.)\n\n-In the pieces with text/lyrics, both genres use many languages besides English. (Lots of people say they can't understand classical music sung in German, yet they listen to plenty of K-pop or songs in French and don't mind looking up a translation, or they appreciate it for other aspects besides the lyrics.)\n\n-Both genres contain relatively short pieces (3-5 minutes) and longer pieces (10+, or even 60 minutes+). (So the length of composition isn't really a big factor, since you can find both short and long pieces in either genre.)\n\nSo those are many of the similarities I can think of. But one thing that's really different between most (not all) classical music and most (not all) of popular music is the fact that the drumset (or electronic beat, or incredibly rhythmic or percussive strumming on a guitar, or vocal percussion, or something that makes a similar sound) keeps really obvious control of the rhythm at all times. It's really hard not to know where the beat is in popular music, whereas in classical music, sometimes the meter is a bit more obscure. \n\nI think that most people really like feeling their body or mind move in time with the music, and so the accessibility of the rhythmic feel in popular genres is appealing to a wider audience. \n\nContrast this to classical music, where sometimes, even to a trained musician, the meter is intentionally less clear. In most cases, the meter may be clear to someone who knows what they're listening for, but still not totally obvious to the average music listener. It gives people less of a rhythmic foothold into the piece, which I contend is the reason that people don't enjoy classical music as much.\n\nTo clarify: I'm not coming from a place of thinking classical music is better. I'm not assigning value judgments here, or trying to be an elitist. I'm merely trying to find what I would consider the main differences between classical and popular genres to be. And to me, the lack of a drumset (or other instrument that keeps the meter as a very up-front feature) in classical music seems to be the biggest difference that I can spot. \n\nOne final caveat: In this CMV, I'm mostly talking about listening to music on one's own, like at your house, or on your own iPod. I think the experience of attending a concert of classical music vs. pop music is a really different one. I don't blame anyone that thinks that orchestra concerts can feel a bit stuffy. So while people may enjoy the more energetic atmosphere at a popular music concert, I don't think there's much difference to putting on your iPod while you go for a run and listening to Beethoven vs. the Beatles when you're on your own and not in a concert setting. \n\nThe reason I'd like my view changed: I truly want to know the reasons that most people would have for not loving classical music so that I can address that in my future performance and teaching in the hopes of exposing a wider swath of the population to an art form that I love so much. I truly believe that classical music is universal and anyone can enjoy it. But I need to start by finding out the real reasons that people don't already listen to it. \n\nThe main thing that I think will CMV: \n\n-Compelling examples of features people like about popular music that are unique to popular music. Not features that are shared between both genres. I really want to find out what makes popular styles uniquely engaging to people in ways that classical music is not. \n\nTL;DR: Classical music almost never has a drumset to help keep really clear track of the time for the listener. People like feeling rhythmically grounded, and so popular styles are more accessible to a wider audience.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

I think a lot of think  you list as differences aren't (it's very easy to feel a \"rhythm\" in most classical music) and most the things you say aren't are (small) differences.\n\nBut in the end, I think the answer is *very* simple. \n\nIt's not exclusive to classical music... it applies to *all* music that isn't \"popular\". It's just simply that most people aren't that into music in general and won't put the necessary effort (/time) in to \"get into\" a genre outside their comfort zone... be that something that isn't really *that* different, like Classical, or Blues, or Country, or something wildly different like Noise, or Free Jazz. \n\nSecond Response: \nCould you be looking at this from the wrong angle? You're asking two completely different things: 1) Why people don't listen to classical music; 2) Is it because classical music doesn't have a drum set?\n\nThe way I see it is that most people stick with what they're used to or exposed to at some formative age. I know someone who listened to a ton of classical music because his father used to play it in the house while he was growing up. His dad was very knowledgeable about the composers, artists, etc. and passed that on to his son. I, on the other hand, was exposed to a ton of classical rock (from my friends) when I was growing up. That's still the music that I like the most, and he still likes classical music best. In fact, I didn't get into classical music at all (I'm still a noob) until I watched Requiem for a Dream and got blown away by the soundtrack - Kronos Quartet did an amazing job. Though my friend tried, I was resistant to it because of my own lack of \"training.\"\n\nThat's how it is with exposure to music. If you show me what's \"popular\" right now I would just stare blankly at the list. The whole Taylor Swift/Nicki Minaj drama meant nothing to me because I don't know a single song by Minaj. So it isn't a matter of the qualities of the music, it's more about exposure and discovery. Classical music isn't a presence the same way pop music is. I think that's what accounts for the difference in popularity.\n\nGreat post, by the way.

Acronyms that are not initialisms are pronounced like they are words of their own, which brings me to point 2:\n\n* \"It's pronounced like 'gift' because that's the only other word with 'gif'!\" by that logic, due to the existence of the word 'girth', 'giraffe' would be pronounced with a hard g. 'Gift' is the exception not the rule. See; [here](http://www.theschoolhouse.us/lessons/lesson53.html). To base the pronunciation of a word on an exception is highly illogical.\n\n* \"The dictionary says both pronunciations are fine!\" The dictionary also says that 'literally' means both literally and not literally. See; [here](http://theweek.com/articles/466957/how-wrong-definition-literally-sneaked-into-dictionary). This is because the dictionary typically reflects how words are used, not what is correct. So if people started pronouncing epitome like its spelled, the dictionary would also likely say that the incorrect pronunciation is fine there, too. This does not, however, make the pronunciation correct.\n\nSo without further ado, Change My View!\n\nEdit: For future commenters, I will be arguing only at the grammatical level from here on out, as I have seen the same arguments from a common usage standpoint enough, and have already awarded several deltas in that category.\n\nFirst Response: \nLanguage is one debate that is not exclusively grounded in structure.  The *English* language slaps structure in the face and laughs.\n\nThe pronunciation or acceptance of a new word just come down to use.  How many people say one *vs* how many say another.  While the original, intended pronunciation for the word by it's creator was jiff the average person interprets it as gift minus t.  We *could* argue the *why* of it, but it is moot.  Once the word is used that way in mass, it is accepted into the dictionary and becomes correct - whether it was that way or not previously.\n\nKeep in mind that the function that language serves is to communicate more easily.  If rules conflict with that priority, they hurt the language.  Rules are instead made to *help* that agenda. So if people are naturally inclined to pronounce something one way, it would be counterproductive to enforce the opposite.\n\nSecond Response: \ni mean the person who made .gif has said it's pronounced jif but that's the thing isn't it? jif is pronounced jif. we already have a spelling for that sound that brooks no arguments so it makes more sense for gif to be a different sound (with a hard g)\n\nif you wanted to spell gif as in gift how else would you spell it? an italian would write ghif to be fair, but i think most people would just write gif\n\ngi- having a j sound is a rule in romance languages. giraffe in italian is giraffa. our word for giraffe is based on this and so follows the same rules. the words that aren't based off romance languages follow different rules (these are the ones like gift and girth) and we didn't get .gif from italy so why should we use italian pronunciation for it? \n\n(note i'm using italian and not french/spanish in my examples because i'm familiar with italian. french/spanish may have different pronunciations (i forget tbh) but there is a separate gi- sound as opposed to ga- (or go- or gu-) in each of the languages)\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response takes a more academic and philosophical approach to the subject of language, emphasizing the dynamic nature of language and its evolution.

{"index": 234, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: China is Not Currently a Serious Challenger to Western Dominance Because of its Lack of Cultural Influence\n\nOriginal Post: \nIt appears to me that when people talk about the rise of China as a global force, all they talk about is political clout and economic strength. However, one thing which I believe is important and not many people are talking about is *cultural influence*. I'm not talking about GDP or lobbying power, I'm talking about blue jeans, pop music, the idea of social mobility, emancipation and suffrage for all. These are all concepts born in the West and exported all around the world, causing social changes in the cultures of the countries they take root in. More and more young Japanese are breaking off from their country's own traditions to follow Western culture, before their radicalization (also, unfortunately, facilitated by the West) blue jeans and pop music was taking the Middle East by storm, African nouveau riche seek to emulate the Western businessman lifestyle ideal of sleek cars and fat cigars. The whole *idea* of the Western way of life has bled into the cultures of countries all over the world, and has likely changed them almost irrevocably.\n\nHowever, I cannot see that the same thing has happened with regards to China. The biggest cultural exporter in the East as far as I can see is Japan, despite its smaller economy and shrinking population: people still can't get enough of Manga and anime, of Japanese fashion (the trendier edge of which is mainly a Japanese take on Western fashion), of Japanese cuisine, of the whole idea of the Japanese society as one of politeness and civility in any situation. Heck, even Japanese bands are some of the most globally popular Eastern bands (though South Korea might take the crown with regards to this one after PSY).\n\nThe point I'm making is that apart from cuisine, I cannot see of any real cultural impact Chinese culture has had on the rest of the world, especially when compared to the influences of Western culture as well as Korean and Japanese culture. Because of this, I find it hard to take China seriously as a social threat, although politically and economically I accept that they are strong.\n\nFirst Response: \nI believe that what you are referring to is called Soft Power (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power). You can oppose it to hard power where a country spreads its influence through economic or military power.\nThe US and Europe have historically used both: soft power is the cultural influence you're referring to and hard power would be colonialism (amongst other methods)\n\nChina has hard power: The US is highly dependent on their economy and they can dictate terms in many industries (lobbying as you mentioned).\nMy point is that perhaps as a westerner, you won't be appealed by their lifestyle now, but further down the road, other generations might be.\nYour example of African nouveau rich is my counter argument:\nFirst, Europeans colonized Africa with hard power, and many generations later, Africans have started to be influenced by Europeans' soft power (cars and cigars).\nWho knows? You don\u2019t feel any relation to Chinese culture right now but perhaps your grandkids will!\n\n\nSecond Response: \nIf hard power is the ability to make people do what you want, soft is the ability to make people want what you want.  Cultural influence/ soft power comes after hard power.  Once it's clear that you're the the top dog, people will ape your ways.  China will probably never have the sort of cultural influence the US does at its peak, but the US was second in that category only to the USSR, so that's whatever the opposite of damning with faint praise is called.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Both responses address the original post's argument about China's lack of cultural influence, but they differ significantly in tone, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, and engagement level.\n\n**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n  - *First Response:* The tone is constructive and somewhat optimistic. It encourages the original poster to consider potential future changes regarding cultural influence. It presents a nuanced view of power dynamics without dismissing the OP's argument outright.\n  - *Second Response:* The tone is more cynical and terse.

{"index": 235, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: USA was unjustified in bombing Japan to hasten the end of World War 2. The government of USA should apologize from the nation of Japan.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWhy I hold this view:\n\n1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\n2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? \nNo one would say yes.\n\n     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. \n\n\n3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.\n\n4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: \n\n\u201cJapan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\u201d\n\n\nWe erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.\n\n\nFirst Response: \nHiroshima and Nagasaki were entirely justified by the standards of the time. You're objection is also rather interesting, because you seem to be hung up on the use of nuclear weapons, when that's not even the worst thing that was done:\n\nHiroshima had 100,000 dead. Nagasaki is around 80,000.\n\nFirebombing of Tokyo, using conventional weapons: 120,000.\n\nBattle of Berlin: 200,000 dead, of which 22,000 were civilians, but where a massive number of the \"soldiers\" were actually conscripted elderly men and young boys.\n\nBattle of Stalingrad: 1,700,000 to 2,000,000 casualties, 40,000 of which were civilians that fell to Luftwaffe air raids *in the first week.*\n\nRape of Nanking: Unknown, on the order of 100,000 to 300,000.\n\nBattle of Okinawa: 120,000 soldiers killed, and 150,000 civilians killed or committed suicide, amounting to 1/4 of the local population. **Bear in mind that this happened immediately prior to the bombings, and were used as a case study as to what could happen if the US invaded the Japanese mainland.**\n\nIn addition, by this point in the war, 20,000 Chinese were dying every week under the Japanese occupation of China, which was still ongoing despite the disastrous nature of the Pacific campaign for Japan.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that Operation Downfall was something the US military wanted to avoid, particularly in the wake of Okinawa, where the civilians themselves fought off the US forces or committed mass suicide. The Japanese casualty figures for a mainland invasion were a direct extrapolation of what happened on Okinawa.\n\nAll told, 60,000,000 people (at least) died in World War II. There was significant evidence at the time that an invasion of Japan would have tacked on another 10,000,000 to 15,000,000.\n\nIn addition, the Japanese weren't going to surrender to the terms that the Allies demanded (which themselves were terms that were meant to prevent *another* world war from ever occurring). Ultimately, the bombings were a necessary event that brought an end to probably the most horrific decade our species has ever seen.\n\nThe comparison to 9/11 is also not appropriate, because the bombings were between two countries in a declared state of war, and where actual military targets were identified, and also in an era where civilian casualties were much more acceptable. In all likelihood, if we hadn't nuked the two cities, we would have obliterated them with conventional weapons. 9/11, on the other hand, was a direct attack against a target that was entirely civilian in nature, and against another target that was staffed almost entirely by civilians, and in the modern era where civilian casualties are no longer acceptable (largely due to the horrors of WWII, as well as Vietnam and Korea).\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\nThe other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.\n\n[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)\n\n&gt; If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.\n\nYOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.\n\nHiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.\n\n&gt; Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war.

If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.\n\nApples and oranges to compare Al-Qaeda, a rogue terrorist organization and total war between nations.\n\n[Everybody was attacking civilian targets in WW2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II).  When nations go to war, that is what happens.\n\n&gt; The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.\n\nYou have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.\n\nThe Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)\n\n&gt; \u201cJapan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\u201d\n\nAnd despite all that, they still refused to surrender.

Because of demographic sorting, gerrymandering, and disproportionate representation of small states, the House gives hugely unequal weight to the opinions of rural and suburban voters, and undervalues urban voters.  Hence how in 2012 House Democrats could actually receive 1,000,000 more popular votes than the Republicans yet walk away with only 46% of the seats.\n\nSecond Response: \n1.  It is unreasonable in a republic to expect an elected body to be a rubber stamp.  In as much as they are elected by the people they represent, Senators have a duty to exercise their powers to meaningfully represent them.\n\n2. This is a republic, not a democracy.  The objective is to have governance accountable to the people, not to have the people's will on every issue immediately enacted.  The Senate has been a valuable part of good governance in the United States, and there is great benefit in not rushing to pass legislation on the barest of legislative majorities.\n\n3.  The Senate is not able to be gerrymandered because of the fixed borders among states.  This is a major problem for how representative House seats are.  For instance [in 2012, Democrats got 1.5 million more votes for the House than Republicans, but more Republicans were elected by a large margin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_2012)\n\n4.  There is value in having a small legislative body whose membership does not change quickly.  There are a lot of members of the house, which means few of them have much negotiating leverage over bills, and cannot exert influence over leadership.  Further, because they're elected every 2 years, they constantly need party support for their next election.  Senators have more time in office, and are in a small enough body where their one vote can make a meaningful enough difference to get changes.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the structured and multifaceted approach taken by the Second Response.

Israel is also another example of a western valued country in the region.\n\n&gt;2) They care about more than just themselves.\n\n\nI feel that this part is based on an incredibly....optimistic view of the Kurds.\n\nKurdish middlemen, including Kurdish political leaders are quite willing to work with ISIS when there's material gains involved. See their involvement with helping ISIS to sell oil for instance:\n\nhttp://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/6c269c4e-5ace-11e4-b449-00144feab7de.html#axzz3hJfQSOhy\n\nEvery single political group in the Middle-East are largely motivated by material gains. Even incredibly ideological groups have bottom lines. The Kurds are fighting ISIS because they are a threat to Kurdistan, if ISIS wasn't a threat to the Kurds, the Kurds wouldn't fight them even if they are committing genocide.\n\n&gt;3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.\n\nTurkey isn't even too different from the US in the 1980s in this regard, who cooperated with Islamic extremists to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan. \n\nPeople are primarily motivated by realistic geopolitics in the region. It's awfully problematic to attribute actions to \"morals\" or ideology when there are so many strange bedfellows if you look at ideology. \n\nSyria for instance is allied with Iran despite Syria being a nominally secular, atheistic state and Iran is a theocracy. \n\nSaudi Arabia, the most Islamist country in the region and Egypt are also close despite the fact that the current dictator (let's just admit it) of Egypt came to power on the promise that he will save the country from the Islamists. \n\nIsrael, a western, Jewish state and Saudi Arabia, a country which don't allow Jews into the country, have a defacto alliance against Iran. And Israel sees the Saudis as a stabilizer in the Gulf.\n\nOverall, I think you underestimate how self-interested people are, if the day comes when the Kurds needs to cooperate with ISIS (say against the Iraqi central government), they will do it to guarantee their own survival.\n\nSecond Response: \n\"The Kurds\" are an ethnic group, with a similar mix of people as any other. There are many Kurds in ISIS. When you're describing \"The Kurds,\" you're conflating many different groups with different agendas and ideologies, to the point that they have openly fought each other in the past. For example, you cite women's rights, when Kurdish areas have some of the highest rates of Female Genital Mutilation of anywhere in the world. The YPG in Syria are a socialist/communist movement with a high regard for women's rights, but they are drastically different from the Iraqi Kurds. The same PKK fighters that might save the Yizidis one month are placing fake emergency calls and shooting/kidnapping the police and nurses who respond the next.\n\nI am extremely sympathetic to the cause of the YPG in particular, but I feel like your view is unduly influenced by the way the western media has simplified and thereby misrepresented the situation in the middle east. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the more nuanced and empathetic tone of the Second Response, which engages with the original poster\u2019s points while introducing complexity to the discourse.

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"index": 239, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: There is no rational reason for me to get married (28/M/grad student)\n\nOriginal Post: \nThrowaway account, my main is used for school.  \n\nI'm 28, male, and a grad student (chemistry). I've been dating a girl for two years and our relationship is wonderful. She frequently brings up marriage and talks about how she believes I'll never propose to her, and I've told her that I'm honestly not sure how I feel about the whole concept of marriage. I would have no problem staying with her for my entire life, but I just don't understand how a ring and a piece of paper makes any difference.\n\nLet me outline my preconceptions here: My parents' marriage fell apart due to infidelity and divorce. I watched my mom cheat on my dad, take all his money in court, and leave him psychologically damaged until the day he died. Admittedly it has me a bit scared.\n\nHere are the benefits I often hear claimed about marriage, along with my response to them:\n\n* More sex: We've been like bunnies for the whole relationship (at least twice a day) and honestly I have a pretty low sex drive. It's already more than enough.\n\n* Children: I don't want kids, don't have kids, and am 100% sterile by choice. Nothing to do about it. She is equally happy to go without them.\n\n* Added financial benefit / tax breaks: We already contribute equally to the relationship in terms of finances. We end up paying for everything about 50/50. Tax breaks? Ok, sure, but that's not going to sell me on it right off the bat.\n\n\nNow here are some drawbacks I often see cited about marriage, along with my response:\n\n\n* Expense: A ring is supposed to cost three month's salary?! A wedding costs over $10,000?! I'm a grad student, for crying out loud. This kind of stuff is absolutely not affordable, and even if it was it seems like a huge waste just to conform to a social norm. Paying more for a little bit of metal and rock than for a decent used car seems absolutely insane to me.\n\n\n* Divorce Risk: Statistics don't lie. I have a 50/50 chance of going through exactly what my late father did.\n\n\nI hate seeing how sad the thought of just being my girlfriend forever (but not my wife) makes her.  I love this girl a lot, but I am also a very rational and logical person and can't seem to find the personal justification for marriage.\n\nPlease, try to change my view - and thank you.\n\nEdit 1:  Whoever you are, thank you for mass-downvoting all my responses.  I'm trying to have a civil discourse, and if I'm frustrating you I don't mean anything negative by it.\n\nEdit 2:  Thank you all for your insight.  I have awarded one delta on this topic but for the most part I have not been convinced that marriage is for me.  Consider this CMV closed, although I may check back later to respond to any trailing opinions.\n\nI appreciate your time, and thank you very much.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Reason can pull you both ways, either into it for financial and legal reasons (tax cuts, if there was ever an accident you'd be legally recognized as next of kin, etc.) or out of it for practicality reasons. Unless you're religious and/or you desire offspring, marriage is something that can be easily considered trivial.\n\n\nThat said, I can see how your experience with divorce has colored your views, and rightly so. But you need to not let fear of a single potential outcome determine your approach to something. Especially if that something is a thing that someone you consider precious would like as part of her future.\n\n\nConsider for a moment what marriage in the modern day is... In truth, it's just legally recognized love. That is to say that if you love this girl, and you're already committed to her wholly, then you're emotionally already married but without the tax cuts, the legal recognition, and the failsafe should things go sour (divorce court). \n\n\nAnd as an aside, as many have said, the expense of a wedding is not something that needs to be a concern unless it's of personal concern to you both. Personally, my husband and I bought wooden rings off Etsy (his was $60, mine was $200 because it's ebony from Isreal), and we eloped. The expense? The price of the marriage license and the fuel to get it. And let me tell you, I have zero regrets about that, it was exactly how we wanted it when we wanted it. \n\n\nAnd a little bonus, people like giving wedding gifts. We set up a GoFundMe page because we didn't want gifts, but cash, and ended up coming out with over a grand in gift money. So it's not all bad =)\n\nSecond Response: \nI don't know about your jurisdiction, but if the downside for you is the legal risk of divorce/financial  support, etc.  You may already be incurring that risk by being in a cohabiting relationship.  Common-law spouses are treated very similarly to married ones.  In which case the only reason for not marrying your girlfriend is cost of wedding/etc.\n\nThose costs can be reduced by the way. Some people don't get rings at all and get hitched at town hall for next to nothing. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the emotional engagement and personal anecdotes present in the first response. It acknowledges the original poster's (OP) fears and relates them to broader themes of love and commitment, making it more empathetic. By framing marriage as a reflection of emotional commitment rather than merely legalese, it successfully appeals to the OP's love for his girlfriend and suggests a re-evaluation of how he views marriage. \n\nAdditionally, the first responder\u2019s personal story about how they approached their wedding offers a practical example that invites the OP to reconsider the logistics and emotional significance of marriage beyond mere cost. In contrast, the second response lacks a deeper emotional appeal and primarily focuses on the legal and financial aspects, which may not resonate as strongly with the OP's expressed concerns about personal significance and emotional connection.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 240, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:Belief in Christianity Does Not Necessitate the Belief that Homosexuality is a Sin\n\nOriginal Post: \nIt is well known that the old testament refers to homosexuality as \"an abomination.\" However, most christians do not believe in the applicability of Old Testament rules to the modern day due to the new covenant of Jesus Christ. Under this interpretation, homosexuality should be judged to be just as immoral as wearing mixed fabrics or eating pig, which to almost all Christians is \"not at all\". In fact, the notion that \"homosexuality is a sin\" is inconsistent with the theme of the New Testament, which Christians put much more emphasis on. In the New Testament, Jesus encourages believers not to judge the immorality of a person by what is socially acceptable, which is essentially what those who would say that homosexuality is a sin are doing.\n\n*edit. So I have conceded that Homosexuality is a sin in the sense that all sexuality is a sin through lust. BUT that's not the crux of the argument about homosexuality. The question is whether homosexuality is 'especially' sinful.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Certainly nearly everything *sexual* is a sin.  The only exception would be intercourse for the purpose of pro-creation.\n\nSo looking at a woman with lustful thoughts is a sin.  Looking at pornography is a sin. Masturbation is a sin.  And, certainly, man-on-man anal sex is a sin.\n\nSo the only way that homosexuality *wouldn't* be a sin is if it were never an influence in one's life.  That mean, a dude can't even *think about* how good some cowboy's ass looks in his chaps.  And if you never even get to the point of thinking about stuff like that, how do you define it as homosexuality in the first place?  Homosexuality *is* the lusting after members of the same gender.\n\nSo while I would be more inclined to agree that homosexuality is no more or less of a sin than non-reproductive-oriented heterosexuality, I don't see how you could claim that homosexuality isn't a sin at all.\n\nSecond Response: \nWell, yea.\n\nThere is a large and growing number of Christians, including religious leaders, theologians, historians, and whole denominations, who don't think a universal and eternal condemnation of all same gender relationships is an accurate understanding or appropriate application of scripture.\n\nThe Episcopal church is not a small or marginalized denomination, and the church General Convention recently voted with an 85% majority to [**extend the sacrament of marriage to same gender couples**](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/07/01/why-the-episcopal-church-is-still-debating-gay-marriage/). And they are [**far from alone**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT-affirming_Christian_denominations).\n\nAlso, why would you think that all sexuality is a sin? It's not a sin to sexually desire your own spouse.\n\nIt's worth noting that Reconstructionist, Reform, and most branches of Conservative Judaism do not think same gender relationships are inherently sinful either. Even the famous Levitical passages aren't a blanket condemnation of same gender relationships. Among other things, they don't say anything about relationships between women at all. They exclusively address sex between men, and only under the specific conditions in which one man is being treated *\"as if he were a woman.\"*\n\nThere are a lot of different ideas on what exactly that meant when it was written. Conservative Judaism tends to understand it as condemning penetrative sex between men, without condemning other forms of sex or relationship between men. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, and many branches of Christianity, tend to see these passages as forbidding men from using sex as a form of ownership over other men, with implications of sexual slavery.\n\nIn both cases, these are culturally and historically specific texts referring not to gay people in general, but to the execution of people believed at the time to either be endangering the foundations of the universe, or people engaged in sexual slavery and rape.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response has an informative and conciliatory tone, aiming to present alternative viewpoints backed by examples of progressive Christian thought.

{"index": 243, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Zach Jesse should not have been banned for life from MtG tournaments by Wizards of the Coast\n\nOriginal Post: \nSo I'm not sure how many of you guys are aware of the recent events in the MtG world but today a professional player, Zach Jesse, was banned presumably because of his past criminal history which includes a sexual assault guilty plea when he was 19. I'm not aware of the exact circumstances surrounding his offense. \n\nWhat unsettles me about the ban is that it seems to have occurred because another player, Drew Levin, pointed out Jesse's criminal past with a Twitter post: \"\"Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal.\" It should be noted that this is a very speculative and misleading statement, as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea.\n\nWizards of the Coast gave a short statement saying that the reasoning behind the ban was to ensure that players feel safe at events. Obviously a worthy endeavor, but I don't see how it really applies here. We are talking about large events at convention centers with thousands of people, security, etc. If, in the eyes of the law, he is not considered a threat to the public (i.e. not in jail) then how can Wizards see him as one?\n\nAnd what's the point in attempting to rehabilitate criminals if they are to be forever shunned from participating even in large public events? It's not like the guy is applying for a teaching job at an elementary school or something. They even banned him from online play.\n\nLastly, I do not think Wizards should have taken this action based on a Twitter witch-hunt that was started by another player. If they want to have a universal no criminal record policy at all of their events, then maybe it would be justified. But to selectively ban one person because he was villified on a social media site is pretty unreasonable, IMO.\n\nI want to hear people's thoughts on this because it seems like the r/magictcg community is vehemently opposed to the ban. I'd like to hear some outside opinion's. The SRS crowd seems to support the ban, calling r/magictcg a bunch of rape apologists, etc, but then again the SRS crowd is not very logical or reasonable. So I'd like to hear what you all think. CMV,\n\nEdit: If anyone can provide a source that he was convicted of rape, I will award you a delta.\n\nEdit: So my view has been changed due to new information I have been made aware of regarding the details of Jesse's crime. Anally raping an unconscious girl over a toilet is pretty despicable, I had no idea his offense was even close to that magnitude. Thanks everyone who responded here. I can understand with why Wizards does not want someone who has done something so vulgar to be a top name in their tournament scene.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

He was charged with rape and plead to aggravated sexual battery (according to [this](http://www.wm.edu/offices/police/sexualassault/laws/) the difference is vaginal penetration, though I couldn't find that in the statutes specifically). He plead guilty to aggravated sexual battery because a rape conviction has a 5 year minimum sentence and that charge was dropped because of the plea, not because of the specific facts at hand.\n\nThis would be in line with the tweet:\n\n&gt;\"\"Quick reminder: Zach Jesse is a literal rapist who got away with serving three months of an eight year plea deal.\"\n\nIt doesn't say *convicted* rapist, it says *literal* rapist. I can't see anything where he argues he didn't have sex with her, just that it was consensual and/or the alcohol's fault. The aggravated sexual battery charge alone would match other state's as well as some people's colloquial definition of \"rape.\" If this was nonconsensual (as he plead guilty to) and involved penetration then it would indeed be rape, and the lesser charge would be an artifact of the plea  bargaining system (as the person mentions).\n\nAgain, not sure if that satisfies your \"convicted of rape\" requirement, and I want to specify I am not at all making any comment on the banning, but it is the facts of the case as far as I have been able to find and understand them.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; \" as the public is not aware of the details surrounding his plea\" \n\nIf you want to be you can get a copy of his plea agreement as all agreements for felonies must be submitted in writing to the Circuit Court.  You can contact the Charlottesville Circuit Court Clerk [here](http://www.courts.state.va.us/courts/circuit/charlottesville/home.html). Now he didn't get away with serving 3 months of an 8 year sentence he was literally sentenced to 8 years with all but 3 months suspended.  In other words the judge sentenced him to a three month active sentence and can revoke the suspended period should he commit another violation during his period of good behavior.\n\n&gt; he is not considered a threat to the public\n\nHe is a violent sex offender.  He has to let the police know where he lives and works at all times so they can keep tabs on him.  He is visited at a minimum of once a year by a State Police officer who verifies this information through a surprise visit.  In addition he must provide the police any and all usernames on social media, email addresses, vehicles he regularly uses, and his dna.  [See Va Code 9.1-903](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title9.1/chapter9/section9.1-903/)\n\nHe wasn't convicted of rape he had the charge reduced to aggravated sexual battery under Va Code 18.2-67.3 from rape.  You can find it by looking him up [here in the Charlottesville Circuit Court](http://ewsocis1.courts.state.va.us/CJISWeb/MainMenu.do).  While the charge was reduced from rape the statement of facts which he admitted was accurate as part of his plea agreement states that he anally and vaginally raped a girl.

It attempts to clarify the ambiguity surrounding the term \"rape\" in relation to Jesse's plea deal while showing concern for the accuracy of public narratives.\n   - The **Second Response** adopts a more assertive tone, particularly when describing the implications of Jesse's status as a violent sex offender.

There are marked, important (and known!) differences between the brains of women and those of men. Gender dysphoria is often visible in an fMRI as those with it will have the same brain structure of their chosen gender but the sex organs of the other gender.\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nWell when it comes to gender dysphoria, gender is used to mean something more like \"how i perceive myself/how i think i should be\", rather than like \"masculinity and femininity\", which is how its usually used. These are sometimes split up into \"gender identity\" and \"gender roles\". (Most of the time,) when someone wants to transition, it's not about wanting to fit in with the more masculine/feminine gender role, its about being uncomfortable with their biological sex, and wanting to fix that. Transsexual has obvious connotations with sexual orientations like homosexual though, and people use the term transgender to avoid that.\n\nTheres some evidence that gender identity is rooted in the brain, and assuming that's true, it exists in a fairly definable way. Gender roles and masculinity/femininity exist more as a concept, and can vary greatly between cultures. In that way \"gender\" doesn't really exist in any absolute, definable way.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to the prediction are rooted in the engagement level and the clarity of explanation in the second response.

{"index": 245, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: \"Not All X\", such as \"Not all men\" has a small, but important place in gender equality discussion.\n\nOriginal Post: \nHi! I'm trying to learn feminism -- which is a huge topic, and like all huge topics, has it's good and bad. I was recently introduced to the scathing disdain for the \"not all men\" sentiment. \n\nI'd like to start out by establishing a few things, because it's important to know that I don't support using this sentiment broadly.\n\n1. Where a victim is grieving, confiding, venting, or however else they are dealing with a problem, it is an inappropriate time to use \"not all men\". The focus belongs on the victim and their healing at that time, not nitpicking their wording.\n2. \"Not all men\", in the way I'm using it here, is actually \"not all X\", where X is any group in a discussion that has a broad, negative statement said toward their group. We see it most frequently thanks to the (most often deserving) scorn targeted at the \"not all men\" sentiment, but I do mean Not all X, where X is any group.\n\n###The value of accurate language\n\nAs a young boy, when I said \"women are bad at math\", my father corrected me. He said \"some women are bad at math\". When my brother said \"you never let me go to town,\" he corrected him by saying \"I usually don't, but here are the times I did\". My father took issue with \"global\" language, as he called it, no matter what form it came in, because he saw it as harmful.\n\nHave you ever felt a burden to prove you're some blanket statements that was often leveled against your kind? \"Women are bad at math\", or \"women cry so easily\", or \"blacks are stupid\", or \"feminist hate men\". For me personally, when I saw \"men are so shallow\" growing up I felt a sense of hostility from the statement. It felt like a judgement against me, and I felt like I had to carry the burden to show people that even though men are shallow, I'm a man and I'm not.\n\nThe point is, if we use careful speech, like \"I hate it when men are shallow / some men are so shallow\", OR \"It really bothers me a woman cries over the smallest thing\" and \"some women cry so easily\", we avoid creating broad, negative labels.  These labels can create a great sense of shame in the targeted group, and this shame fosters a sense of otherness. Instead of the shamed person feeling included or a part of something, they feel excluded. This, and the shame can also sabotage a person's self value and chance at success.\n\nBy biggest concern is the sense of otherness it can create, driving away potential allies, and by god we need a lot of allies to address the institutionalized racism and sexism in most western nations.\n\n**Therefore**\n\n1. I believe it is in the best interest of those seeking to address an oppressive culture to use accurate language in order to be inclusive to as many as possible, to maximize their efforts\n2. Just as it is the responsibility of the privileged to not use broad, negative language to describe the oppressed, it's also (far down on the priority list) the responsibility of the oppressed to not use broad, negative language to describe the privilege. Because, really, it's a human's responsibility to a human to not use broad, negative language against a human. To a reasonable length, of course,  and I d not believe adding \"some\" before men, women, asians, etc, is much of a stretch.\n\n###Picking an appropriate time\n\nAgain, the time to say \"not all X\" is not when a victim is trying to overcome their harm. But in casual conversation, as a small aside, it is good for all people to correct others when they use this harmful, broad language.\n\n####Conclusion / TL;DR: No matter the group, broad language assigning negative traits to another group is harmful, and it is our responsibility as humans to take reasonable efforts to avoid propagating this harm, starting first with ourselves, second in mild conversation, and never while a victim is trying to overcome harm. We should never become comfortable using broad, negative language.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

You feel the more correct way to express it is to say it is \"not all women are bad at math\".    \n\nIt's still a sexist statement because you're still associating a group with a negative stereotype (but somehow excusing it by say there are exceptions).     Why not say \"not all *students* are good at math\"?   \n\nThe specific phrase \"not all men\" has been used to attempt to shut down conversation when someone points out a sexist/ mysoginist comment.    Here's [an article]( http://jezebel.com/your-guide-to-not-all-men-the-best-meme-on-the-interne-1573535818) which explains it far better than I can.   \n\nSecond Response: \nI think the biggest issue with the response \"Not all [insert noun here] are like that...\", which I've been guilty of using before when I feel I've been associated wrongly, is that as a phrase it acts as a dismissive and without quantifying the issue. Many stereotypes have some basis in a common trend found in reality, and when having a discussion it's, I feel, just as harmful to say \"all X are like this\" as it is to say \"not all X are like this\". The former implies that every single member of a group acts a certain way, and the latter implies that almost no member of the group acts that way. When I say \"not all men are like that\" I'm suggesting that most men aren't like that. And both sides are equally devoid of any real factual quantifiable value. When it comes to discussions of human rights like this, and equality, it is very easily for a conversation to become so heated with emotional tension that it loses objectivity. Without being able to put hard statistics towards a goal (e.g. \"% of men who are abusive in their relationships\", \"% of women who've committed rape\", \"what the wage gap actually is\") it's very easy to just go with a gut feeling and wave a banner without any actual solid ground to stand on. And the most difficult thing is, because these questions are so political and there's so much riding on them, the numbers are very inaccurate, lack precision, are very prone to skew, and can vary wildly in interpretation depending on the context. \n\n**TLDR; Saying \"not all X are like this\" implies that it's a minority of X who are like this. It dismisses the issue and minimizes it, without ever quantifying any objective numbers to support the notion. The argument is purely emotionally defensive.** \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To predict which response may have changed the original poster's view, we can analyze the stylistic elements of both responses.\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - The **First Response** maintains a confrontational tone, stating disagreement straight away. It uses a more critical language that might be perceived as dismissive of the original poster's sentiments. This tone could engender defensiveness from the original poster.\n   - The **Second Response**, conversely, adopts a reflective tone where the responder admits to guilt in using \"not all\" expressions in the past. This self-reflection likely makes the tone more relatable and less confrontational.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**:\n   - The **First Response** leverages direct confrontation and references an external article to support its viewpoint, but does not engage with the original poster's personal experiences or broader claims. This approach may come across as an attack on the poster's argument rather than facilitating dialogue.\n   - The **Second Response** employs analogical reasoning, comparing both \"not all\" and \"all\" statements as problematic and delving into the nuances of how to communicate effectively. This encourages mutual understanding rather than escalated conflict.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**:\n   - The **First Response** is somewhat more formal, which could make it less accessible, particularly for someone less versed in feminist discourse.\n   - The **Second Response** utilizes a conversational style that invites more accessibility and clarity. Its complexity is balanced with thoughtful sentence construction, making it easier for the original poster to digest.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**:\n   - The **First Response** addresses specific points but feels more like a critique rather than genuinely engaging with the original poster\u2019s reasoning.\n   - The **Second Response** explicitly relates to the original poster's experience and acknowledges the validity of emotional responses, fostering a dialogue that could facilitate understanding.\n\n**Prediction**:\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factors**:\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include the tone and emotional approach combined with engagement.

The biggest barrier to improving our system is the *social* view of it as an immutable, timeless document (not at all what the Founding Fathers intended it to be). Were there at some point in history massive consensus that the Senate should be abolished, but only just under the 3/4-states limit, that would have been noticed, but such a consensus has never been there, only to be thwarted by the supermajority. Even if it were, changing the supreme law of the land is something for which is reasonable to expect a supermajority. These are rules beyond ordinary laws, rules which affect every person and state within our borders, and 51% of the country should not be able to make such huge changes.\n\nThink about it from the other perspective as well. We have such a flawed system, how much worse would it be if those in positions of power could change it to their benefit with relative ease?\n\nThe major problems in the Constitution are not simple fixes that most amendments would cover, or that a lower-barrier-to-entry system to facilitate the changing of. IMO, the whole Senate can go. Maybe replace it with a proportional body. The increased feasibility in your model depends heavily on *how* amendments are made easier, and even then, the greatest barrier will be getting the public on board to make such a sweeping change. If you can't get enough of the public for a supermajority on board, as far as I'm concerned there is not enough consensus to ethically move forward anyway.\n\nSecond Response: \nSo I get the feeling you don't have that much of an understanding of the history of the Constitutions based on the points you made. First off:\n\n&gt;The problem is compounded by the fact that making substantial changes to the document is difficult, if not to say nearly impossible in any but the best of circumstances.\n\nThere are a few points to unpack here. \n\n1. It is certainly not impossible, we have proven that 17 or 27 times, depending on how you view the Bill of Rights. Furthermore it was replacing a system, the Articles of Confederation, that was *practically impossible* to change.  \n\n2. Next the Constitutions *should be hard to change*, as someone pointed out this is not the tax code. This is a document that provides both the underlying structural setup of our governmental system **and** codifies the ideals of nation into law. There should be a damn high barrier of entry to be a part of it. \n\n3. In addition, our system of government was designed to be slow, to make people think about the laws that were being passed. It's not a bug, its a feature.\n\n4. Putting those together I would like to point out that the ratification system seems a good compromise to me. We don't want a system where a simple majority is enough any more then we want a couple states to hold us back. This says we need to show a much larger interest in it as a country. \n\n5. Easy Amendments take away from the Supreme Courts ability to make rulings. Part of what makes them powerful is that it is not simple to change the document, and that to do so requires near unanimous dislike and outrage. A strong court is good for the people be court is actually the best at reflecting the will of the people([weird](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2087255) I know, but [true](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/ten-miles-square/2013/06/how_the_supreme_court_responds045541.php)). \n\n&gt;Those combined factors mean that the U.S. may, slowly but surely, become backward compared to other countries with modern founding documents and laws. \n\nPlease name a few. Honestly I am concerned by the fact other countries take a weak stance on Freedom of Speech. To the point where the Legislature had to pass the SPEECH Act. The abuses these \"modern\" countries allow concern me greatly. I would much rather our \"backward\" system. \n\n&gt;Unfortunately, failure to foresee that conditions in the future might warrant a radically different document means that the Constitution enshrines certain rights that make no sense in the modern day, and can indeed be harmful to the fabric of society, while ignoring others that are now far more relevant. \n\nOnce again, be specific. I find this comments the most concerning because the are usually doused in uneven application of the rules and critical misunderstanding system. If your going to make these claims, don't hide behind ambiguity, tell us what you think these mismanaged rights are. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the tone and emotional approach of each response.

{"index": 247, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: There is no such thing as good frozen pizza.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWhere a restaurant's pizza quality can range from amazing to average, frozen pizza ranges from average to inedible.  There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant.\n\nI have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail.  I've come to terms with the fact that every variety has low-quality sauce and not enough cheese.  What I can't stand, however, and definitely the most common flaw, is the terrible, *terrible* crust, which ends up either undercooked or bone dry, without fail.\n\nI understand that pizza can only be properly cooked using a pizza stone, but it completely baffles me that this is the best we can do without one in 2015.\n\nFirst Response: \nI disagree with you, but this sounds like a personal opinion on taste than an actual viewpoint.\n\nSometimes little ceasers \"hot and ready\" Pizzas are not exactly fresh, I have had some shitty pizzas from there (and some amazing ones).\n\nI would say that the delissio rising crust when cooked properly and fresh out of the oven is superior to the lower tier of little ceasers hot and ready pizzas. Mainly because of the immediacy you can eat the pizza from the oven.\n\nYes the frozen crust is always worst. I just don't eat it.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe Totino's little party pizzas are wonderful. They are admittedly horrible, but they are also wonderfully horrible. It's like a train wreck in your mouth. \n\nLittle Ceasars is also far from the worst pizza you can find from a pizzeria. I stumbled into a place in Chicago that appeared to have not known the difference between salt and sugar when making their sauce. Side note from another place: If you are going to put out garlic salt instead of garlic powder... warn us. \n\nLittle Ceasars, Dominoes, Pizza Hut etc. are all mediocre pizza places. Most chains are. But there are definitely some places that long to serve pizza, really longing to have a pizza because they have only heard of them by rough description. \n\nFor frozen if you look at the Jacks/ Tombstone/ Red Baron types... these are absolutely what you are talking about. Light on the cheese, heavy on the lack of taste. \n\nThese also sell for about $3 a pie. The cost of a slice at a good place. \n\nBut you want to move up in quality. So you think Di'giorno or Freschetta.. but these are made by the same companies as the shitty ones listed above with the same idea... which is to make pizza really cheap. Most pizza toppings also don't survive freezing very well. Which is why there is a lot of compromise in quality. \n\nHowever if you are in a store that puts a lot of effort and branding into their store brand (Wegmans in the northeast comes to mind)... their frozen pizza, and all of their store branded items are made to re-enforce the brand of the store. Which is why their name is all over the packaging instead of having an \"Exclusive brand\" like \"Everyday essentials\". \n\nThose are going to be the frozen pizzas that have the best chance of not just being a decent frozen meal, but also being a decent pizza. Different from a pizzeria but just as good on a quality scale. (The aforementioned Wegmans pizzas always struck me as a little floury and not as greasy as the closest pizzerias to me growing up. But very close to one of the upscale pizzerias I found on Chicago's Michigan Avenue)\n\nYou might want to also look into picking up a frozen pizza (mailed directly to you) from Chicagos \"Giordanos\". It is as close as I've come to getting good pizzeria quality pizza from frozen. Also about the same cost as getting it in the store.\n\nYou're not going to get a NYC pizzeria quality pie from frozen though. The hand tossed dough etc. just isn't replicable in the large scale assembly line demanded by frozen. But then again.. you're not going to get that NYC quality in most of the country from a pizzeria anyway. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response is more effective in changing the original poster\u2019s view due to its more engaging and nuanced tone, use of rhetorical techniques, and a clear structure that improves readability.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   The second response employs a humorous and relatable tone, stating that Totino's pizzas are \"wonderfully horrible,\" which creates a friendly atmosphere for discussion.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nAs someone who loved being homeschooled, and was much better off for it, I can say that you should at least have an understanding of something before you try to make it illegal.\n\nFirst, education takes up an extraordinarily large portion of children's lives and we should be careful when making significant changes. Because of this, you should realize that a all-inclusive legal mandate is probably not the best approach. Disregarding any issues of parental rights, it's generally more efficient and productive to allow for homeschooling. Parents are generally more in-tune to their children's needs and care more about the quality of education. Even though many academically challenged students are switched to homeschooling, homeschoolers consistently perform better on standardized testing.\n\n&gt; Homeschooling your kid is just insurance that he/she will be socially awkward, and disadvantaged\n\nYou should research homeschooling more, instead of relying on stereotypes, if you actually think this is the case.\n\nSecond, it's evident from your post that you do not understand the US public school system (I'm assuming US from the context of your post). Most people would laugh at the naive belief that:\n\n&gt; In public school you are exposed to many different views, opinions, and types of people. These problems would be solved if everyone had to go to public school. Everyone would have an equal education, and equal opportunity.\n\nThe most obvious issue with this is that public schools are already staggeringly unequal. Here's a great video about education and some of its issues:\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_changing_education_paradigms\n\n&gt; The kids who go to private schools are usually rich white kids that already have a socioenconomic advantage.\n\nAgain, it seems like you are basing your opinion off of ignorant stereotypes. Approach the issue from a perspective of assumed ignorance--try to learn about something before you form an opinion. \n\n&gt; I have never seen any benifit to private school. \n\nThey usually teach spelling and communication which are important life skills.\n\n&gt; My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe\n\nWhile it's nice that your anecdotal experience went well for you, have the capacity to realize that it doesn't necessarily apply in all, or even the majority, of cases.\n\nFinally, realize that \"I don't like X\" shouldn't always translate to \"X should be illegal\"; X, in this case, is homeschooling. A recurring anthem for this forum full of  \"There should be a LAW\" posts:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0la5DBtOVNI\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; I was a regular upper-middle class guy who went to public school. I loved it. My school was great. We went on fun field trips, and even a trip to Europe.\n\nNot all public schools are equal. Others have already made this point, but you'd learn a lot if you listened to [these](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with) [two](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/563/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-two) episodes of This American Life. Public schools are also subject to the prejudices of the society that surrounds them. In those episodes you'll ~~see~~ hear parents of white children protest, loudly and vocally, against the school's decision to accept black students from another neighbourhood, despite the fact that the black kids had to travel over an hour to get to the majority-white school. It's definitely an eye-opener.\n\nSo another concern: What about the money? Currently, about [4%](http://equipeducation.org/Downloads/HomeschoolPopulationReport2010.pdf) of K-12 students in the US are homeschooled. Where would the public schools find the money to accommodate all these people?\n\nNot all homeschooling is bad either. If you'd take a look at [these](http://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ794828) [two](http://equipeducation.org/Downloads/HomeschoolPopulationReport2010.pdf) studies you'll see that homeschooled students perform at least just as well as students attending public schools. The second study is the most interesting since it shows that with good, structured homeschooling the children consistently outperformed public school students across several measures. Just as all public schools aren't equal, all homeschooling isn't equal. But it *can* do a very good job when used well.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are primarily related to engagement and the use of evidence to support arguments.

{"index": 249, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: McDonald's Liebeck lawsuit was frivolous\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've read through the details of the Liebeck v McDonald's lawsuit many times. I still cannot grasp how it was the fault of McDonald's in any way, shape, or form.\n\nThe facts are:\n\n* McDonalds brewed (and continues to brew) coffee at standard brewing temperatures of 200F \n* McDonalds holds and serves its coffee after brewing between 170-180F (which is no different than most other restaurants)\n* McDonalds has *NOT* lowered the temperature of their coffee, nor have the changed the temps at which they hold and serve coffee\n\nTo me, the purchaser of coffee acknowledges the fact that they're buying near-boiling water when they decided \"hey, I want coffee\". Change my view, please.\n\n[sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebeck_v._McDonald%27s_Restaurants)\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nLooks like I screwed up by questioning the frivolousness of the case. Even if the blame doesn't lie on McDonalds, the case does not seem to be frivolous in the slightest. This was an easy one. Thanks guys.\n\nFirst Response: \nFrivolousness (the actual legal term) is a really high bar. \n\nThere are two types, factual and legal frivolousness.  For factual frivolousness the Supreme Court [has held the standard to be as follows.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9141408508548092395)\n\n&gt;[A] court may dismiss a claim as factually frivolous only if the facts alleged are \"clearly baseless,\" 490 U. S., at 327, a category encompassing allegations 33*33 that are \"fanciful,\" id., at 325, \"fantastic,\" id., at 328, and \"delusional,\" ibid. As those words suggest, a finding of factual frivolousness is appropriate when the facts alleged rise to the level of the irrational or the wholly incredible, whether or not there are judicially noticeable facts available to contradict them.\n\nThis case is clearly not factually frivolous under that standard.  The facts alleged were that the plaintiff was burned (true) by coffee that was hot (true), that was above industry temperature standards (a plausible assertion of fact), and that McDonald's willfully made its coffee hotter than standard (a plausible assertion of fact).\n\nAs far as legal frivolousness, this is defined [as follows:](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=868429855339617087&amp;q=legal+merit+frivolous&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,33)\n\n&gt;an appeal on a matter of law is frivolous where none of the legal points are arguable on their merits.\n\nIn this case, there was at least a plausible case for tort negligence based on the alleged facts.  It might be a case that's a likely loser, but as long as there's some level of sane argument to be made, it's not frivolous.\n\nSecond Response: \nFrivolous has a very limited meaning, and this lawsuit does not qualify.  To be frivolous, a lawsuit must have no merit.  But here, McDonald's deliberately set the temperature of their coffee to one that could cause tissue damage (&gt;110 degrees F).  Had they set that coffee to a temperature under 110, it would be highly unlikely that any damage would have ensued.  So they are at least partially at fault in any scald injury.  Liebeck did indeed suffer a scald injury, and she did so by exposure to hot McDonald's coffee.  With those elements satisfied (McDonald's had a duty to safeguard its customers, it took an action that conflicted with that duty, she suffered injury, and the injury was caused by McDonalds' action), the case is not frivolous.\n\nWe might want to live in a world in which coffee can be served above 110F without fear of lawsuits.  I happen to enjoy McDonald's coffee.  That desire doesn't change the definition of frivolous, however.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Both responses exhibit a degree of similarity, but they diverge in specific stylistic elements that likely influenced the original poster's views. \n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** adopts a scholarly and formal tone by including legal definitions and references to court decisions.

Since you don't know how to draw that line, your proposed ban would be unenforceable. In addition, it would be illegal since the government has no business determining what people can and cannot say, short of explicit and serious incitement to criminal conduct. The First Amendment forbids censorship.\n\nHowever, there is a way to stop taxpayer money going to attack ads. Ban all taxpayer funding of any political campaign.\n\nSecond Response: \nBANNED? That's quite extreme, don't you think? For my arguments I will be using a few sources: [#1](http://jonathanrose.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Rose-in-Taras-Waddell.pdf), [#2](http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/irpp06%20rose.pdf) &amp; [#3](http://195.130.87.21:8080/dspace/bitstream/123456789/513/1/Political%20Marketing%20In%20Modern%20Canadian%20Federal%20Elections.pdf).\n\n\n\nAs I understand it your view is based on *negative* attack ads used by political parties, but not all ads used by the political parties are attack ads, or negative. (But please realize that negative is a loose term, even an ad that says something bad about another party's policy is \"negative\" even if it does it in a neutral tone. There's a specific term for that: acceptable negative.) Most ads tell us the priorities of competing parties and the differences in their policy platforms. They serve a very useful function: To provide voters with information in a simple manner that is easily recalled. Points made in debates are not easily recalled since they get lost in the back-and-forth.\n\n\n\nEven negative ads serve a very useful function. They may be ugly, but they're often full of information regarding a political party's position on a policy or a candidate's weaknesses. They are actually scrutinized to a much higher level than positive ads and actually serve an important purpose in getting the public to engage with issues.\n\n\n\nNegative ads are based on policy over personality in a 4:1 ratio, so the media's mania over the overinfluence of negative ads is overblown. In fact, as you can see from the second source I provided Canadians do not react favourably towards personal attack ads and all parties are wary of crossing a line and losing votes as a result. Some negativity is to be expected, but Canadians are pretty nice about it all.\n\nPlus, there's the simple fact than one party (CPC) is the best at fundraising --probably because it's the only major right-of-centre party-- and it uses that money to produce ads b/w elections, when there's no restriction on spending. By banning attack ads, you're penalizing the other parties from being able to defend themselves from attacks b/w elections. Please take a close look at table 7.2 in the first source I've provided - the disparities in spending are shocking.\n\n\nBut what about your alternative of more debates? Is it really a good idea to have a LOT of debates and no ads? I don't think so. I watched the recent Maclean's Leaders Debate and while I enjoyed the debate, I was appalled at the post-debate analysis. The talking heads were discussing which *zinger* really hit home and how it would affect that leader's image. There was another section --the most awful one, in my opinion-- that had a \"[body language expert](https://youtu.be/hSf2__qpeGA?t=2h44m24s)\" analyze the body language of each of the candidates and draw conclusions on their personality **and** policy. It was AWFUL! If the television media actually cared about reporting on policy, I'd be with you for all debates all the time. But they boil it down to a competition among leaders that's part of the problem.

As such, the success of a franchise is dependent on the supporters who pay money for tickets, gear, etc. If we were to look at attendance figures for the National Woman's Soccer League (NWSL) for 2014 compared to Major League Soccer (MLS), we see a huge disparity in people attending games. \n\nOf course, this translates over to other leagues. The NBA draws more people than the WNBA, both live and TV ratings. The revenue of the NFL is exponentially greater than the Independent Woman's Football League. \n\nI'm not here to provide solutions to this, or look into why the mentality of America draws more into guy sports. Yes, I think that ladies should be paid equally. ~~I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better.~~ And of course, ladies have as much of a right to play in any sport and play it professionally. But (and yes here comes a South Park reference) \"...you can't expect people to watch.\" My conclusion: the pay gap in sports is a consequence of economic revenue, rather than social injustice. \n\nOpen to any replies and criticism.\n\nEDIT: This is awesome and I thank you all for your input. You all taught me that there is a physical difference in athleticism between men and women. And that the pay gap is exaggerated. \n\nFirst Response: \nYour arguments are perfectly valid. Of course NBA players are going to be paid more than WNBA players as long as there are more people watching the NBA.\n\nBut take a step back and ask yourself, why do more people watch the NBA than the WNBA?\n\nThe chief claim is that men are better than women at sports, and we want to watch the best teams. While it's true that men's teams outperform women's teams, it's ridiculous to say that we only want to watch the best teams. Some fans choose college games over professional because they're more exciting. Fans of the Mets fall in love with their team despite their obvious inferiority to the Yankees. And I, for one, prefer women's soccer to men's because the USWNT actually wins major tournaments.\n\nThe truth is, people watch the teams they watch because that's what they're accustomed to. It's what their friends watch, what's discussed on the news, what draws crowds and earns parades. So the lack of pay, the lack of press, the lack of attention is something of a self-fulfilling prophesy. As long as we say no one cares about women's sports, no one will care about women's sports.\n\nIf you change the narrative to promote equal coverage, women's sports will draw equal attention. Just look at tennis.\n\nSecond Response: \n \"I also think ladies have the ability to play all sports as good as men do, if not better\"\n\nHate to break it to you, but they aren't even comparable.\n\nThe womens national teams from some of the top countries in soccer will almost always get beat by mens U-17 U-18 or U-19.\n\nThe US national womens team scrimmaged the U-17 boys in 2012 and were beat 8-2.\n\nOther top countries had similar results, and this is just what I know from soccer. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the tone and emotional approach used in the First Response, which is constructive and engaging.

The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:\n\n#Cities have significantly better municipal services.\n\nThe difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.\n\n#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.\n\nA really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.\n\n#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.\n\nIf you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything. Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become \"that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction.\" This  tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can \"just spend time with the people you like,\" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.\n\n#bugs\n\nholy fucking shit the bugs aaaaaaaaa\n\n#In the country, everything is high maintenance.\n\nSince just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;there is a greater range of things to do\n\nI would greatly dispute this.  Few cities have any decent opportunities for hiking, kayaking, sailing, hunting, trapping, fishing, birding, shooting, or a great deal of other activities.  When I find myself in a city for whatever reasons, I find myself quickly getting bored due to the lack of interesting things to do.\n\n&gt;There are theatres\n\nSmall towns have those too.\n\n&gt;large public events\n\nThis is a negative to me.  I can only think of one large public event that I enjoy, and it involves camping.\n\n&gt;strip clubs\n\nDon't need or want them.\n\n&gt;meetings of like-minded people and clubs\n\nThese are pretty easy to find out in the country.\n\n&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored\n\nLike I stated before, cities have a severe lack of most of the sorts of things I like doing.\n\n&gt;Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity\n\nThis can also effectively be achieved by having a mile or so in between your house and your neighbour's.  You never have to see another human if you don't want to.  Cities are just so crowded and there are people everywhere.  In a city, I feel like I can't snese without accidentally invading someone's space, and I certainly have no hope of having no one invade mine.  In the right place country, I could set off a bomb and no one would give a shit.\n\n&gt;bugs\n\n&gt;holy fucking shit the bugs\n\nThis is actually a major plus to me.  In the city, I'm lucky to see a single Black Saddlebags, but in the country I can see a wide range of different insects.  As someone with a fascination for entomology, this is a fantastic experience to me.  The only bugs I don't like are things like gnats and mosquitoes, but you get those in cities just as much as you do in the country.  Maybe even more so, depending on the place.\n\n&gt;In the country, everything is high maintenance.\n\n&gt;Since just about everything that isn't a tractor was designed to operate in a man-made environment, everything keeps getting dirty and breaking. Cars and houses and electronics and appliances and furniture all need to be repaired and/or replaced noticeably more frequently than they would in the city.\n\nSounds like you are making stuff up.  I have not experienced any appliances having significantly shorter lives in the country.  It is pretty easy to keep things clean even living far from other people.  Living in the country is not the same as camping.\n\nOverall, I can't imagine ever being able to live in a city.  Most cities I measure how long I can stand to be in them in hours (the best cities rate days).  A few cities I would only be able to stand a few minutes and at least one I found so terrible that I refuse to ever go there again.\n\nEdit:  I forgot to point out the most important one: \"Everything is closer in the city\".  I love having space and having things further apart means more space.  Having things closer together is a big negative to me and is the main reason that I would not be able to ever stand living in the city.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;I honestly do not understand how it would appeal to anyone.\n\nHonestly, this just shows a lack of maturity and a fundamental lack of knowledge about the human condition. \n\n&gt;Cities have bigger and better libraries\n\nOK... but I don't need a big library. I just need a kiosk that is part of the intra-library loan program. When I want to read a book, I do it from home.\n\n&gt;schools\n\nThis is rather obviously not the case. Public schools in major cities are cesspools, and achieve worse results with more funding than suburban or rural schools. \n\n&gt;police/fire departments\n\nI don't know of any way to measure this, other than to say that my sheriff's office has cleared 100% of the homicides in my county in the last 10 years... how's your city doing in that regard?\n\n&gt;hospitals\n\nSure\n\n&gt;gas\n\nI've got some bad news for you, there, bucko. Gas, both of the gasoline and natural varieties, is cheaper in the country. \n\n&gt;internet\n\nI'm at the edge of a small city, so I get to partake of their municipal broadband. I pay $34.99 a month for 50/5. No caps or bullshit or trying to sell my information to the highest bidder either. When I have an issue, I call a local phone number than is answered by a local tech. The one time I've had to have a tech come out to my house, I called at noon and he was there by 1:30. \n\nI mean this in the nicest possible way, but I'm kicking your ass in this regard. Might want to try again. \n\n&gt;As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first.\n\nI've had 4G LTE since 2012. And it's fast. Much faster than yours, as a matter of fact, since I have significantly less traffic congestion. \n\n&gt;A really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops.\n\nOK... and? You telling me that Amazon has geographic cutoffs?\n\n&gt;Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties.\n\nI haven't been to an indoor mall in damn near a decade, and I see no reason to change this. A mall is one of the last things I'd consider a positive. \n\nOne of the best restaurants I've ever been to was the Old Miner's Inn in Alba, MO, population 555. Michelin 3 star French cuisine. Phenomenal. \n\nAnother personal favorite is the Craftwood Inn in Manitou Springs, Colorado, population 5,245.\n\n&gt;There are theatres\n\nThere are theatres everywhere. Even in small towns. Those movin' pictures sure are cool!\n\n&gt; large public events\n\nWe have those too, but I have to tell you, I hate crowds, and have less than zero interest in going to a large public event. \n\n&gt;strip clubs\n\nYou're seriously listing this as a positive? *Come to Metropolis, we have more strip clubs per capita than any other city in the US!*\n\n&gt;meetings of like-minded people\n\nI've got some more news for you. You have meetings of like-minded people everywhere. All that's required for said meeting is for several like-minded people to locate one another. \n\n&gt;clubs \n\nPlease see my previous comment about crowds\n\n&gt;just about anything to do if you ever get bored\n\nI've lived in the country for more than 15 years now, and I can't say that I've ever been bored. I'd guess that one big difference between myself and a denzien of, say, NYC, is that the activities I choose to entertain myself mainly occur outside.\n\n&gt;There's a convenience store on just about every corner.\n\nIt saddens me that you view this as a good thing. I personally find this worse than the previous comment about strip clubs. \n\n&gt;If you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares.\n\nWell, the co-op board sure does. And the nosy neighbors that I am now forced to share a wall with do. \n\n&gt;If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a new neighbor that they wanna get to know and everything.\n\nHeaven forbid that people want to be friendly, as opposed to smacking the ceiling with a broom handle and telling you to turn down your music. \n\n&gt;Even if you abstain from social interaction, you become \"that weird neighbor that abstains from social interaction.\" \n\nAs opposed to the weirdo in 4C that has his groceries delivered and hasn't left his apartment in 2 years? And have you walked by there lately? The SMELL!\n\n&gt;This tends to temper individualism, and it's not like you can \"just spend time with the people you like,\" because rumors and all travel fast with a community that small.\n\nI don't see how this can temper individualism, and rumors spread like wildfire within any social group.

I'd MUCH rather live in my well-built country home, with it's high end appliances, than I would one of the shithole shoeboxes that city suckers have to contend with. My master suite is bigger than most NYC apartments. \n\nI'm pretty sure you just made this point up. \n\nNot to mention, I can pee off my deck without it being illegal. Or have a bonfire to celebrate something. Smoke meat without getting the fire department called on me. Shoot in my backyard without getting the police called on me. Walk down the road without being worried about getting mugged. Leave my keys in the car without worrying about it being stolen.

I have several reasons to holdthis view - here they are, sorted by relevance (from least to most relevant). \n\n* They eat poo.\n* They are annoying. Many people have really strong opinions against smoking in public, because it is upsetting them and accordingly laws have been past in many countries that limit/prohibit smoking in public transport, public buildings, etc. However, it is not uncommon to be leg-humped by a dog in the bus, or step into dog-poo in the park, which I find really annoying. This seems to be regarded as unproblematic, some pepole even get annoyed if you do not want to touch their animal companion with questionable hygiene standards.* You may say that (contrary to smoking) these are merely inconveniences, but in fact...\n* ...Some dogs are plain dangerous. Have a look at the [\"Fatal dog attacks\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatal_dog_attacks_in_the_United_States) wiki entry. Granted, there are MUCH more people dying from cars, cigaretts, cancer (and that's only deadly stuff with a C), etc. but in my opinion even one person would be too much. There are a lot of young children on the list as well. \n* My rant so far may have given you the opinion that I just hate animals. However, the opposite is true - I love them! Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day. \n* They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. \n* Most importantly: They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them! [The co2-\"paw print\" of a big dog that gets fed mostly meat may even be bigger than the emissions caused by an SUV.](http://www.salon.com/2014/11/20/the_surprisingly_large_carbon_paw_print_of_your_beloved_pet_partner/)\n\nTherefore I am convinced that you probably shouldn't own a dog.

A few benefits: \n\n* Having dogs makes the owner significantly more likely to be sufficiently [physically active](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2156050/). From the study: \"odds of achieving sufficient physical activity and walking were 57% to 77% higher among dog owners compared with those not owning dogs...\" This is backed up [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379705003995) and [here](http://journals.humankinetics.com/AcuCustom/Sitename/Documents/DocumentItem/17134.pdf) and in many, many other studies.\n\n* Dogs are extremely helpful in reducing the healthcare costs of the elderly. [Proof](http://jah.sagepub.com/content/20/4/437.short): \"Interaction between humans and dogs is a mechanism that can enhance the physical and psychological health of elderly citizens and promote a social support network between dog owners. In turn, dependence and impact on health and social services are alleviated.\"\n\n* Owning pets is extremely beneficial for [one's psychological health](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-13783-001/). From the study: \"owners enjoyed better well-being when their pets fulfilled social needs better, and the support that pets provided complemented rather than competed with human sources.\"\n\nThere are more benefits, like the fact that pets make owners laugh a lot, etc. But I'd like to talk about a few things you've brought up:\n\n&gt; They are annoying.\n\nWell-trained dogs aren't annoying at all. In fact, dogs are highly intelligent and respond very well to training. Some owners are worse than others is all. Responsible owners know the benefits of training their dogs.\n\n&gt; They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable.\n\nYou're assuming that all the resources that are used to produce dog food would be magically transferred to alleviating global hunger - that's unlikely to happen. \n\nSo, what do you think?\n\nEdit: fixed link\n\nSecond Response: \nI'll hit your relevant ones first:\n\n&gt; They produce greenhouse gases - and quite a lot of them!\n\nThat article it basing a lot of that greenhouse gas emission off of a primarily meat based diet...which a lot of dogs don't usually have.  Most people I know primarily feed their dogs non-meat based food.  Take [Purina](http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/purina-pro-plan-dog-food-selects-dry/) for example, it's mostly fish product (less greenhouse producing compared to land based meats) and grains.  A lot of the meats that also go into dog food are byproducts of human meat consumption as well...so it's not like there are farms of animals specifically for dog food.\n\nIMO, this article is pretty weaksauce.\n\n&gt; They eat. In a world where people are starving this is in my opinion morally not justifiable. \n\nIt's logistics.  People are going to starve regardless if you have pets or kids or if you live high on the hog eating steaks every night.  Having a pet is irrelevant to other people starving.  The food and resources going into a dog probably won't ever make it to these people unless you actively choose to spend your time and money diverting resources to starving people rather than have a pet.\n\n&gt; Therefore I think we shouldn't keep them for our amusement or because we fancy a walk once or twice a day.\n\nIt's companionship more than entertainment.  If you're a good pet owner this is a mutually beneficial life for both parties.  \n\n&gt; Some dogs are plain dangerous\n\nNot any more dangerous than people, or other wild animals.  And a well trained dog with a proper owner wouldn't have issues like this.\n\n&gt; They are annoying\n\nSee above.  A well trained dog with a proper owner doesn't have issues with barking or bothering people.  Proper owners also clean up after their pets.\n\n&gt; They eat poo\n\nOnly if you let them.  A baby would eat poo too if it got hold of some and you weren't paying attention.\n\nTL;DR.  It seems like a lot of these issues are a symptom of poor training and irresponsible owners.  You should be against careless owners rather than saying a blanket statement of \"no one should own dogs\".\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response is more likely to have changed the original poster's view due to its comprehensive engagement with the specific points raised in the original post.

{"index": 254, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Regular season games are boring.\n\nOriginal Post: \n**tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting?**\n\nI would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.\n\nBoring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.\n\nThe NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.\n\nSo can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.\n\nFirst Response: \nYou should watch soccer. The games are divided into multiple competitions for different trophies rather than a regular and post season. Its much better as every game in a 38 game Premier League season counts, from beginning to end. This also results in the overall best team winning the league rather than a team only playing well for a certain time of year prevailing. \n\nAnd if your into the do-or-die style like in playoffs, there are several cup tournaments thst incorporate the same feelings as playoffs. \n\nSecond Response: \nThe NFL schedule is good because it's so short.  With only 16 games on predictable days, each game has an urgency to it.  It's not quite playoff level, sure, but the difference of 1-2 games can mean an invitation to the playoffs or not... so the teams do bring their best every single game.  There's a lot of parity in the league, so you don't see too many atrocious teams or bad games. \n\nThe MLB schedule is good because it's so long.  The times are predictable and games are cheap &amp; accessible (outside Boston &amp; NY, anyways).  They're not *exciting*, particularly on TV IMO... but they're fun in person, and nice to have on in the background on a lazy summer day.  There are some crummy teams/games, but MLB is a little more about the experience (drinking outside in a fun atmosphere) than the game itself IMO.\n\nThere's no problem with either of those - they're great fun.\n\nI'd have to agree that the NBA &amp; NHL regular seasons kind of suck.  The sport is physical enough and the seasons long enough that there's injury / fatigue risk, so teams play kind of conservatively and rest star players aggressively.  But with 40 home games (instead of the 80-something of mlb), tickets are still rather pricey for many teams.  The game days/times aren't predictable, so I find myself missing them.  A crumby NBA team gets *killed* on the court, it's not supremely fun to watch.\n\nI find myself watching the NBA Christmas day games, going in person a couple times and following my local team (often day after write ups), and then watching better matchups &amp; post season.  I'd love to see the NBA season cut down to 50-60 games and played on consistent days of week.

The kings in Denmark used to be elected, some thousand years ago, but then it became normal to elect kings from the same familly. Then latter it was always the oldest son and then we endeed up with the system where the king was always the oldest son from the old king. The same is more or less true in many other countries. People seem to rather want to vote on people from families they know than random people.\n\nTo me it kind of seems like America is getting set in their political dynasties and that if this development continues, we might end up with a system where everyone in theory can try to be elected president, but in practise it will always be people from the same political dynasties that gets elected.

College is inordinately expensive because loans are so easy to obtain. If I hadn't been able to get a 100k loan, I wouldn't be 100k in debt right now. I would've gone to a state school, and eventually appreciated that fact once I became more emotionally mature. Parents have a hard time letting their kid get a tattoo, but they let you get a HUGE loan on what is right now a big gamble? Please.\n\nNow, why is that relevant? Well, the economy IS doing well right now, but who exactly is in charge? A bunch of people who the future economy won't affect in the slightest. Since a large majority of millenials are bogged by debt, we can't afford to properly flourish the economy like we want to. The rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting to be more poor. Someone's going to get fucked.\n\nTechnology is rapidly advancing, and many of the low-income jobs new grads have been forced to take are about to become obsolete. As there is no general income implemented yet, a LOT of people are about to be broke. The only really essential jobs will be things automation can't accomplish, e.g. unpredictable jobs. Almost any job in existence will likely eventually be run by a machine, I can't think of one that can't, there are factories in Japan that do maintenance on themselves.\n\nAs an American, I don't know much about other nations, as school taught me exactly jack shit about them, but I have to wonder if they're in a similar boat. The model on which our economy is built rapidly becomes more out of date every minute. Eventually we WILL have to make changes, and I doubt those in power at the time will have the competence or open mindedness to do so.\n\nOf course, none of this mindset was helped by [this book](http://www.epi.org/publication/failure-by-design/).\n\nPlease, PLEASE someone change my view.

Whatever features you are looking for in a car, you can get better features for the same or a lower price in a used car. Like, say you have $25,000 to spend on a car. You could get a nice new Toyota, or you could get a fully loaded Lexus that's less than a year old and has features that are superior in every measurable way to the new Toyota. Seems like a no-brainer to me which one I'd buy.

Where I live, the cheapest chinese models cost about 8-10 grand, korean, american and japanese subcompact city cars go for about 10-14 grand, and more compact cars go for 14-18k.  Now, if a new car costs you 14k, like a small toyota, after 5 years and 50,000 m, that car costs about 10-12k, or about 60-75% of it's value.  Toyotas in particular don't depreciate much because of their good reputation, but that's still a lot of money for something that isn't \"new\" anymore, and may have underlying problems and will face maintenance sooner.  This trend is the same across the board with a few exceptions: chinese cars, since the rate of lemons is kind of high, tend to have a much lower resale value.  You basically buy a chinese car for keeps.\n\nit also depends on the situation,  my wife and I are specifically looking for a new car, since her car is 5 years old, we figure it'd be a good idea to alternate buying a new car every 5 years, and buying a seminew car always raises questions.  Why was that car bought in 2014 sold in 2015, when the ink was still dry on the auto loan?  Is it really worth risking 10k to save 2-4k on a car?

I am ONLY trying change your opinion on this particular segment of your reasoning: \"...this was wrong to do, *because he has fought for civil rights before and his economic platform greatly fights for the poor and working class, in which black people are disproportionately represented*.\" I totally agree that Bernie Sanders has one of the better records on civil rights among the candidates who are running. However, that makes him a better target, not a worse one. It would be completely pointless to show up at a Donald Trump rally and say something about Black Lives Matter (or any racial issue). Donald Trump is a clear and overt racist. There is nothing that can be done to make Donald Trump a good candidate on race. Bernie Sanders is a relatively good candidate on race, but many people who have race as the primary political issue that they care about believe that he could be better. By targeting Sanders, who is already a relatively good candidate on race, people can put pressure on him to make race a primary element of his campaign and to refine his opinions on policies regarding racism and social justice. \n\nI don't know what the motivations of these women necessarily were (their message was VERY muddied by a lot of factors) and I don't think their actions were appropriate or helpful at this time. But I think the idea that Bernie Sanders should be free of criticism on racial issues specifically because he has a decent history on them is silly.

You could come up with any number of categories with any number of criteria -- \"oceans\" and \"ocelots\" are both in the category of things which start with the letter \"o\" in English. But this is not a useful scientific category because there is no theory underpinning the common characteristics of those things. \n\nThe definition of life isn't arbitrary--it allows for overarching theoretical descriptions of the common characteristics of living organisms.

The second response relies more on an assertive stance devoid of deeper exploration, limiting the opportunity for meaningful engagement.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response consists of more complex sentences that reflect thoughtfulness and consideration of the issue at hand. It also provides a more substantial argumentation flow. The second response, while clear, lacks depth and nuance, which may alienate the original poster instead of fostering dialogue.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response engages directly with the concepts presented in the original post, making it more likely that the original poster would consider this viewpoint. The second response does not develop a constructive dialogue but rather makes an assertion that risks closing the conversation.\n\nOverall, the first response's combination of a respectful tone, logical argumentation, and comprehensive engagement creates a better opportunity to sway the original poster's view compared to the direct, dismissive approach of the second response.", "is_correct": true}

This much is clear, and it's hilarious because, as genetic modification makes our food more vulnerable to disease, by creating specialization in our economy we have set ourselves up for this. No arguments there.\n\nPoint B) *Within a few centuries, they'll replace almost all of them.*\n\nHere I disagree. We're going to go through a real rough patch, perhaps even causing a weird Great Depression style collapse, but 200 years ago, 90 percent of Americans were agriculturalists. Today, that number is two percent. We evolved, and if you remember the dust bowl struggles when industrial farming came about, you'll remember that was a struggle too.\n\nWe'll remodel our society, as we have for the past forever, to fit needs that, in theory, robots cannot fill, including:\n\n1. **Space exploration and colonization.** Yes, robots have been and are doing an amazing job exploring space for us already, but the value of having a human on another planet, or out in space exploring, is uncountable. AI would help us be able to focus more on the expansion of our species into space.\n\n2. **Entertainment** My biggest disagreement with the CGP video is how he frames the idea of entertainers being replaced by AI. Sure, they can write beautiful music, but how much is recorded music going for right now, anyway? And people enjoy watching PEOPLE perform. There's nothing particularly beautiful about an arabesque, but what's beautiful is watching a person do it. Same with acting, singing, sports, etc.\n\n3. **Engineering**: This one seems pretty simple. It'll be a long time (in theory) before we can automate robots that can out engineer us. \n\n4. **Cyber Protection** This is the biggest one. If all of our medical information is on a universal collection of robot interfaces, we will need basically an endless army of humans to help defend this from hackers. The more AI we have, the more we need to protect it. People who would be able to take control of that AI would control the world.\n\nThere's a lot more, and it's going to be a hard road, but at the end of it, our society will evolve so that our jobs will be more fulfilling and human-necessary. Just as you don't weep for the Iceman, the Lamplighter, and the Switchboard Operator, know that no one will be weeping for the barista, the paralegal, or taxi driver.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou are to a certain extent conflating automation (ability of a machine to do relatively simple, repetitive tasks) and AI. \n\nThe implications of AI depend strongly on the abilities of that AI, which could be roughly classified like this:\n\n1. Narrow AI. Can do specific tasks that are not purely automated, but still relatively low-level. \n2. Analytical AI. Can effectively analyze (in a high-level way) problems with objective solutions. For example, this AI could determine the best treatment for a patient given information on research and the patient's symptoms and test results.\n\n3. Innovative AI. Can come up with truly new ideas and create truly novel things on its own.   For example, this AI could come up with the idea for a new product and design it.\n4. Total AI. Can do literally everything the human mind can do, including things like creating art.\n\nAI of types 1 and 2 essentially increase productivity, but humans remain generally necessary to design new things.  Although it will displace many types of jobs, society with type 2 AI will still have a very broad need for humans to work. \n\nType 3 AI will start closing the loop and therefore cutting humans out of the loop in a more complete way. At that point, the need for humans will be limited to things like the arts.  \n\nThe question, then, is how far are we away from type 3 AI?  We are increasingly developing type 2 AI, but we are conceptually very far away from type 3 AI.  Far enough away that major conceptual leaps will be required to get us there, and it is hard to predict how long it will take us to make those leaps.  It may occur in our lifetimes, it may not.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response has a more conversational and engaging tone. The responder acknowledges the original poster's (OP) concerns while presenting a personal perspective based on shared experiences, which creates a rapport. This approach may foster a better connection and openness to dialogue. The second response feels more technical and clinical, focusing on categorizing AI types, which may be less relatable for the OP.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first responder uses storytelling and analogies, referencing historical workforce changes and cultural aspects (like entertainment) to illustrate their point. This technique is likely more compelling and easier for the OP to digest. In contrast, while the second response is informative and structured, it leans heavily on definitions and classifications, which may come across as dry.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response uses varied sentence lengths and a more straightforward structure, making it easier to follow and relate to. The use of lists towards the end helps emphasize key points without overwhelming the reader. The second response contains complex ideas that may require more concentration to understand, which might disengage the OP.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response directly addresses the OP's views with a clear summation of agreement and disagreement, making an effort to acknowledge the OP's feelings about job loss and future implications. In contrast, the second responder takes a more analytical approach, which, while informative, does not directly engage with the emotional undertone of the OP's argument.\n\nOverall, the first response's combination of relatability, emotional engagement, and effective rhetorical techniques likely made it more influential in potentially changing the OP's view.", "is_correct": true}

Arguing the logic of a position is not the same thing as arguing for the right to voice an opinion. You're allowed to say, \"the sky is red,\" even if you're wrong. I don't know that \"...but, free speech!\" is used to defend positions so much as a defense against censorship or calls to censorship - i.e., \"you're not allowed to say that [because it's wrong, or it's offensive, or any other reason].\" Technically, OP, you're right, but I think you're mixing up two different phenomena here.\n\nSecond Response: \nI'd say in that situation the person's point isn't to argue a point but rather just simply communicate it to someone else. Sure if they wanted to have a discussion then quoting free speech would be silly, but if they don't desire to talk to you and are annoyed you are trying to discredit them they will simply say \"I have the right to this opinion. Leave me alone.\"\n\nEssentially, what I'm trying to say here is that they aren't wrong, they just don't want to talk to you. \n\nThen there's the other argument where the topic of discussion is actually just limiting free speech. For instance: Someone sais \"Religion is wrong and nobody should be allowed to spread it\" Someone else can defend that immediately with free speech, and still not be wrong about religion.

The use of \"I feel like\" introduces a mild personal touch, suggesting a thought-out opinion rather than a combative tone.\n   - **Second Response:** This response carries a more casual and conversational tone.

The kid's mother insists he doesn't act up at home, but the teacher has called her multiple times about her son's behavior. She can't take away recess from kids. She can only send them to the office for 20 minutes at a time. She's not allowed to take pictures or videos of the kids (but she showed us pictures/videos of the kid that day breaking into drawers, throwing stuff, yelling, rolling up carpets, etc). Attempts to discuss the kid with admins are shrugged off. The teacher is very upset because the other kids have complained that they can't learn and some are beginning to follow suit of the shitty kid. \n\nI know this is one example, but her school isn't even among the worst, and it isn't as if teachers inability to control students, despite their wishes to, is surprising. We've all heard about terrible parents, helicopters, complaining about grades etc.\n\nI've had the fortune of going to private schools my entire life (though perhaps that is more due to growing up in one of the worst public school districts in the country). One of the effects of that is that they could discipline you as they saw fit. If you acted shitty, you missed recess, had to call your parents, had to write on the chalkboard, had to stay in the office, got yelled at, etc. Public schools, of course, are another matter and it seems like teachers, the very people entrusted with educating the future, are powerless to do their jobs properly. \n\nSo tell me, is our educational system that fucked because of shitty parents, shitty kids, and shitty administrators, or is it really not that bad?

How often are teachers not given the tools to deal with them? If the answer to both questions is \"very rarely\" then you can't really call it a big problem for the educational system, just a big problem for those unlucky teachers who are put in that position.\n\nSecond Response: \nWhy do you believe this experience can be generalized to all public schools?

{"index": 264, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Regular season games are boring.\n\nOriginal Post: \n**tl;dr - Why do you find regular season games exciting?**\n\nI would describe myself as a pretty avid sports fan. I don't watch every game but when it comes to sports, I know more and watch more than any of my peers through work, school, or friendship. I like hockey, baseball, and the NFL. But regular season games are boring.\n\nBoring can be good sometimes. A casual baseball game on a lazy afternoon is amazing, and it's great in the background during a family gathering. Seeing a game in person is awesome and regular season games are perfect for that because if you miss a play it's not the end of the world. I find the NFL regular season *almost* engaging because of the short schedule. I understand that in the NHL and MLB you need to play more games so the gap between 1st and last is sufficiently large, so I'm not suggesting shorter schedules. I would just really like someone to make regular season games more exciting for me.\n\nThe NHL is my favorite by far, but I can't stand regular season games. Until the very end of the season it just feels like watching practice. There's no excitement. It's like a 10 cent bet. Until the end of the season, very little is on the line. I don't see the appeal.\n\nSo can someone explain it to me? When I ask my friends who do watch the regular season they get condescending.\n\nFirst Response: \nWhile the thrill of every game being a \"do or die\" situation isn't always there, I think if you're a true fan of the game, then regular season games are fun for their own reason.  Sure, it's a bit like practice, but you're watching it for the strategy.  You're watching it for the athletic ability.  You're watching it to see how the management is playing the long game (Do they use a pitcher today in the 13th inning, or save him for his start tomorrow?)\n\nSeeing a guy make an amazing play at shortstop, or seeing a guy shoot the puck past 3 defenders from the blue line is just as awesome no matter when you see it.  \n\nThen there's the rivalries.  I'm always going to be happy to watch the Flyers lose, no matter what.  And lately (lol), the playoffs don't give me that opportunity much.\n\nSecond Response: \nMLB - It's a pass time, baseball is a long, slow grind that builds up gradually and doesn't matter much until the end of the season, this falls into your view of \"not mattering a whole lot\"\n\nNHL - Also my favorite sport, and depending on your team there are three categories that they'll fall into: Obviously making it into the playoffs (Chicago, Anaheim, Tampa, Pittsburgh). Obviously *not* making the playoffs (New Jersey, Arizona, Philadelphia, Toronto, whatever the expansion teams will be), and finally bubble teams (Ottowa, Columbus, Minnesota, Edmonton^maybe , Buffalo^maybe^unlikely )\n\nFor the \"gonna make it\" teams, there isn't much on the line other than home ice advantage, though that doesn't mean much, so the big thing is seeing the team progress and develop and making sure players are healthy, not terribly compelling.\n\nFor the bubble teams, this is where it gets interesting, you're talking about battles *all season long*, the wins *matter* when the team is only 2 points out of the wild card, the last 2 months of the season are frantic, with everyone trying to fight their way into the playoffs, for some people it's as good as playoff hockey from February on.\n\nFor the \"obviously not gonna make it\" teams, the regular season matters the *most* to them! It's all they have and if the team realizes it early enough and there's a highly touted prospect on the board next season (like Austin Matthews) it's incredibly important that the team does poorly. I'm a Sabres fan and this last season was one of the most tense and compelling I've watched in years, because they *needed* to finish last.\n\nSo in the NHL for the majority of the teams at least half of the regular season is extremely important for either making the playoffs, or getting into last for the best chance at the top draft pick.\n\nNFL - \n\nI saved this for last because I almost can't believe that you feel the games are important. There are only 16 games each season! Any single game can and does mean the difference between making the playoffs and going home at the end of December. \n\nEven if a team is bad games have *massive* implications because drafting is so important in the NFL.\n\nCompared to baseball or hockey, each NFL game counts for 10 baseball games, or 5 NHL games, all in one day! You have the majority of the games against teams that are constant rivals, that are battling for just 2 or 3 playoff spots available.\n\nSo much in the NFL can swing on one weekend that it's almost *too* important!\n\nTL:DR - I pretty much agree with baseball, but the NHL and especially the NFL every single game matters for most teams.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In comparing the two responses, several stylistic elements emerge, showcasing their different tones, rhetorical techniques, sentence structures, and engagement levels with the original poster.\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - **First Response**: This response adopts an encouraging and passionate tone, promoting a sense of camaraderie and shared love for sports.

Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.\n\nI believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.\n\nWhat I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV\n\n---Edit---\nMany responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.\n\nTo CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms.

But, can you imagine what revising the Constitution would look like?  The 2nd amendment fight would be brutal.  You would have constitutional guarantees for gun (and more than guns) being balanced between New York City and rural Minnesota.  How do you find common ground?  If you somehow do, how do you get the votes to pass it?  How about the 1st amendment?  What does free speech mean now?  How about religion?  I could go on, but most of the amendments would have people trying to redefine them, and I don't see enough common ground to get any of it done.\n\nAnd there is more!  How about delineating the powers of the branches of government?  Generally, we would probably want something more specific, but what would it look like?  How about the specifically delineated powers of the federal government?  What are the new ones?  It is a very anachronistic list, but what to replace it with? The electoral college?  Probably should be scrapped as one of the first things to do, but with what?  \n\nMost importantly, who is going to lead this process?

Who are today's great men who will lead us through the painful process?  Name 5 people who both liberals and conservatives would trust to make this happen.  Can you get there?  How about to 10?  I think we could find them, really.  I would have to look outside of Washington to do it, though.  And I would have to find people without the visibility to get through the process.  Instead, it would most likely be made up of current and retired high visibility politicians, and how do you feel about them.  Not to mention, the whole method of selecting a team would probably be a deal breaking process in the first place.  \n\nSo, I agree with you.  There is just no way to get it done.\n\nSecond Response: \nIn my opinion, the constitution is fine as it is currently. There's no point in combining or re-writing amendments. The constitution (especially the Bill of Rights) is not something that needs to be changed and should be kept alone. They were written for a reason. The only amendment in the Bill of Rights that some people have a problem with is mostly the 2nd, but that's only because they're ignorant of what the 2nd amendment was written for in the first place. What you could do is try to translate the constitution into a more understandable text for people who aren't really savvy with that sort of thing, but that's already done by not only the courts, but many other people. I'd also like to ask, what exactly would you want to update and or change in the constitution specifically other than the wording of certain things? \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses to the original post, we can observe the following stylistic elements:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is somewhat skeptical but respectful, acknowledging the original poster's good points while expressing concerns about the feasibility of revising the Constitution. The respondent engages with a tone that reflects confusion and highlights complexity, suggesting that while the idea is appealing, it raises many practical issues.\n   - **Second Response:** This tone is more dismissive and definitive, asserting that the Constitution is \"fine as it is\" and that there's \"no point in combining or re-writing amendments.\" It positions itself more adversarially and shows a lack of willingness to engage in a more nuanced discussion, thereby lacking emotional warmth.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - **First Response:** Utilizes rhetorical questioning effectively, asking about the feasibility of the revision process, highlighting potential pitfalls, and inviting the original poster to reflect on the complexities of such a change. It employs a format of explanation that allows for a dialogue.\n   - **Second Response:** Uses categorical statements and an appeal to traditionalism, asserting the importance of the original amendments and implying that they are beyond reproach. This response lacks depth in addressing the original poster's points and does not use rhetorical questioning to engage further.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - **First Response:** The response contains longer, more complex sentences that facilitate a detailed exploration of its arguments.

{"index": 266, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I believe that poor people have every ability to pull themselves out of poverty, but most don't due to a lack of motivation.\n\nOriginal Post: \n**Firstly**, I'm using a throwaway because most people get really sensitive about this and my views are pretty much the antithesis of reddit (love Rand Paul, support Mens Rights, hate Pink Floyd).\n\n**Secondly**, for context, I come from a wealthy family and have had very little experience with people from the lower socioeconomic spectrum, which probably shapes my view of the wealth ladder and how one climbs from rung to rung.\n\n**MOST IMPORTANTLY**: I believe there are levels of poverty within the lower class and perhaps each level should be approached differently in this discussion. They are as follows:\n\n1. *Physically/Mentally Unable to Work*: For all intents and purposes, this category should not be considered in my argument. They physically can't produce value and have little-to-no means to change that situation.\n2. *Homeless/Welfare/Food Stamps*: Sometimes shit happens and people need help, but six months to a year should be enough time for anyone to get out of this category, yet many don't. I think [the 35% of Americans](http://www.cnsnews.com/commentary/terence-p-jeffrey/354-percent-109631000-welfare) asking for handouts get so used to doing it that they forget how to be a valuable member to society and end up just sucking resources from the rest of the productive population which brings everybody down. \n3. *Crippling Debt*: I think people in this situation, regardless of their financial education, show a general lack of care to manage their money. It's not difficult to see if a degree will be worth the salary raise or if a loan will actually solve your current problems and their are more than enough resources online and in libraries to learn about proper finance skills in order to do so.\n4. *Below the poverty threshold*: This is the general catch-all for everyone else in the lower class. I think problems like a botched health care system, over-imprisonment for drug sentences, and a generally rigged system such as having to pay to cash checks, not being able to afford the bulk deals, or own a home are factors that plague the lower class and rigidize social mobility, but it does not take away their opportunity to pull themselves up.\n\nEvery person starts somewhere in life, some get college education paid for, some join the family business and some are born an orphan without a bank account in their name. There's no question that some situations are more difficult than others, but there is also no question that examples of social mobility exist in both directions: rich kids wasting away a fortune and migrant farm workers becoming well-paid astronauts. \n\nI believe that as long as everyone has the freedom to climb the socioeconomic ladder rung by rung, that the only difference is between those that take the opportunity and those that don't and the reason why many people remain in poverty is because they lack the motivation to take the necessary steps, be it because they don't have peers pushing them to do so or because they would prefer to work a minimum wage job instead of applying for better positions--I can't say.\n\nAlthough I was fortunate enough to start adulthood with no debt, I have had to work my ass off to get everything else I have and believe that anyone could be doing what I do and making as much money as I do regardless of their starting hand if they desire it.\n\nEDIT: Great points, everyone. I am starting to see how success takes a combination of hard work and luck, the latter of which is invisible to most who are provided more of it. So far, the most convincing points have been the ones that have illustrated the poverty condition, and not just reminding me how lucky I am. The one thing I can't get past is that even if it is insurmountably more difficult to escape poverty, the fact that it IS possible makes me wonder if the institutions put in place making it difficult to make and keep money were removed if motivation would in fact be the only thing holding them back. I will have to come back a little later and read more thoroughly as I am at work now. Thanks for taking the time to respond.\n\n**EDIT2: I awarded the delta to /u/caw81 way down at the bottom. His/her post was short, but provided a piece of evidence for the mental hardships of the impoverished. A belief is only as strong as its evidence in the logical mind and before his/her post I couldn't get the nagging argument of \"what if they just tried a little harder\" out of my head. I feel strange for ever feeling that way now. Thank you for all your thorough responses.**\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt; I believe that as long as everyone has the freedom to climb the socioeconomic ladder rung by rung, that the only difference is between those that take the opportunity and those that don't and the reason why many people remain in poverty is because they lack the motivation to take the necessary steps, be it because they don't have peers pushing them to do so or because they would prefer to work a minimum wage job instead of applying for better positions--I can't say.\n\nWhat I don't like about this view is that it makes it seem so simple to get out of poverty.  \"'Just Do It' is all you need to fix your financial problems!\"\n\nIts hard to explain but poverty saps you.   Its a struggle just to keep your head above water and the waves are getting bigger and bigger and your are getting more and more tired.  \n\nFor example http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/29/poverty-mental-capacity-complex-tasks  \n\n&gt;The cognitive deficit of being preoccupied with money problems was equivalent to a loss of 13 IQ points, losing an entire night's sleep or being a chronic alcoholic, according to the study. The authors say this could explain why poorer people are more likely to make mistakes or bad decisions that exacerbate their financial difficulties.\n\nIts very hard to figure out what to do, organize yourself to do it, do it and then take advantage of it when you are sapped out.  Is the motivation you are asking of people unrealistic?  \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; I come from a wealthy family and have had very little experience with people from the lower socioeconomic spectrum, which probably shapes my view of the wealth ladder and how one climbs from rung to rung.\n\nThis is all you needed to say. You lived in a higher income area with schools that were better funded. Your parents could give you attention and guidance instead of working multiple jobs. You probably made some connections along the way. All of this will get you into a better college with better prospects. You weren't more motivated, you were just lucky.\n\nThe real nail in the coffin is that there are more people than there are well-paying jobs. Even if everybody were ultra-motivated hard-workers, there would be the same amount of people making minimum wage. You can't really live on minimum wage.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the emotional resonance and empathetic engagement found in the First Response. The tone is relatable and conveys a sense of understanding regarding the struggles faced by impoverished individuals. By using vivid metaphors like \"Poverty saps you\" and \"It's a struggle just to keep your head above water,\" the first responder effectively evokes emotions that demonstrate an appreciation for the complex realities of poverty, rather than framing the issue as solely a lack of motivation. \n\nThe First Response also employs rhetorical techniques such as appealing to authority through the cited study, which adds credibility and provides a factual basis for the emotional argument presented. This combination of emotional appeal and factual reinforcement likely resonates more deeply with the original poster's evolving perspective on the relationship between motivation and the challenges of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, while the Second Response presents logical arguments about luck and systemic issues, it does not engage as effectively on an emotional level, which might make it less impactful in altering the original poster's views. The First Response's use of empathy and understanding suggests a higher likelihood of leaving a lasting impression on the original poster.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 267, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The United States lost World War II\n\nOriginal Post: \nI believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.\n\nI am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.\n\nContrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.\n\nWhat really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?\n\nSorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

We might have universal healthcare, but no gays or Jews. I'm not sure that outcome could be called a \"win\".\n\nMoreover, the Nazis would most likely have been the first to develop nuclear weapons, and quite possibly used them to win the war. \n\nYou claim that the U.S. \"lost\", but I would argue that in fact, civilization *won* due to the fact that the U.S. rebuilt Germany and Japan, both economically and politically, ending both the Nazi and Imperial governments. \n\nSecond Response: \nThere's a lot to your point, but I have a few rebuttals.\n\n1. The U.S. became one of 2 superpowers after WWII. After outlasting the USSR, America is now the only superpower. While this may bring the country into certain conflicts, it has enabled America to become the biggest player in world affairs. The amount of influence America can exert, whether that's been used for good or bad purposes, is incredible.\n\n2. You mention the U.S. military presence doesn't breed goodwill, but I think you've isolated certain regions in a certain time period. Most recently, a U.S. convoy was [welcomed with open arms] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/25/politics/army-convoy-through-europe/) during its trek across Europe. Additionally, the U.S. military, (especially the navy) is central to many humanitarian relief efforts. Here's one [example.] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/14/us-military-relief-philippines_n_4277471.html)\n\n3. Lastly, I don't think universal healthcare should be the measuring point for whether or not a nation succeeded in \"winning\" WWII.

I'm not a fan of (popular, modern) country either, largely for the same reasons you cited.  I'm not much of a fan of pop music, either, and the country you'll find on today's radio is basically just pop with anything edgy or sophisticated taken out.  Basically just pop without what pop is good at.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no doubt an art to making music for mass consumption.  It may not be the type of art that you particularly enjoy.  It may not be the type of art that I particularly enjoy.  But it's an art that takes a tremendous amount of skill, expertise, and talent nonetheless.\n\nIn other words, country may seem formulaic, but if you thought it could be easily replicated you'd be out making millions and banging groupies right now.\n\nWhen I hear a popular radio song that doesn't fit my taste, I've learned to appreciate it by listening for what it does that has made it rise about the countless number of other songs people hoped desperately to be as popular.  For example: the song I'm listening to may have dumb lyrics, but they're lyrics that still appealed to people in some profound way that other, similar songs did not.  Or the song may have a cheesy hook, but what is it about that hook that made it so popular?  That sorta thing.\n\nSecond Response: \nIt seems that you are mostly only familiar with pop country, which is the country commonly put on the radio.  It has the same problems of general pop music in that it is very repetitive and formulaic as the goal is not to make good music, but to sell music.  However, if you ignore the radio, it is fairly easy to find good country music.For me, I enjoy the subgenres of folk and bluegrass.  \n\n[Here is a good example of bluegrass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6kihlmvAfQ).  Notice that it doesn't even need lyrics and relies entirely on the sound of the instruments.  [Bluegrass also can use vocals, such as this one about a river where the signer grew up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCDHxPzrHgo)  Sometimes, a band might also [cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMrAbPSUhA4) existing songs from [other genres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c7bISLhVl8).\n\nFolk you don't often see much originality in terms of lyrics, as it is often involves taking an existing song and putting your own spin on it (compare these [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28Bq_2soGIA) very different takes on the [same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaS3vaNUYgs) song).  [Here is an example that omits the lyrics, but is still highly recognizible to anyone familiar with it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFyvxxsm7RQ)  In terms of relation to other genres of music, American folk music is very closely tied to [Scottish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k9YWf9gWaA) and [Irish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hE9l2p0kLKk) folk music, to such an extent that they will [often blur together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuwzsFAFllA).\n\nI did have a comment about a year ago on a similar topic that was well received, but as you have posted a slightly different argument (focusing on currently produced music rather than the genre as a whole) I have tried to tailor this argument more towards your opinion.

{"index": 269, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The hyper-rationality of our age is detrimental to humans.\n\nOriginal Post: \nLet me begin by defining what I mean when I say hyper-rationality. Hyper-rationality is the social expectation and pressure that every human action and institution must be teologically justified by rational means, rather than a mixture of reason, emotion, tradition, religion, evolutionary instinct etc. I will use one clear example, for the sake of focus, while knowing that there are other examples of this as well. I will talk about producing off-spring.\n\nIn my experience, people against procreating articulate 3-4 arguments against having children. Firstly, that having children will detrimentally affect the environment (1). New humans means more consumers of the Earth's resources and more producers of waste. The long term viability of the earth with exponentially more consumers and producers is uncertain.  Secondly, the cost of having children can be astronomical (2). Thirdly, you become isolated to your social circle and to your spouse due to the time need to take care of your child. \n\nI present these arguments not because they uniquely matter, but because they seem valid. They are, shall we say for the sake of argument, true.  However, in the pursuit of being rational, these arguments have contradicted one of the most basic and scientific principles of life, namely that animals produce off-spring to survive. It is basic evolutionary biology. We observe this in every known creature; we observe our own instincts to sexual activity and pleasure; we observe people's special fondness to babies (3). Yet, despite this obvious teology of humans, the rational arguments are given preference. This seems to play out on the societal level. Education levels and industrialization (a proxy for culture/rationality) correlate with lower birth rates (4). \n\nIn conclusion, this is but one of many examples where hyper-rationality creates a social pressure that contradicts human instinct. \n\n_____\n1. http://green.blogs.nytimes.com//2009/08/07/having-children-brings-high-carbon-impact/\n2. http://money.cnn.com/interactive/pf/cost-of-children/\n3. reddit.com/r/aww\n4. http://www.earth-policy.org/data_highlights/2011/highlights13\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So, when you say that people have a special fondness for babies, you are not taking into account the fact that many people don't, or that there are other things they value far more highly (like a commitment to the environment that brings them fulfillment and purpose).\n\n...\n\nAs a source for the assertion above:  https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3gif1d/ranimalaww_all_the_aww_none_of_the_kids/\n\nA relevant comment from the post: \n\n&gt;[\u2013]SickRosecats not brats! &gt;^..^&lt; 6 points 20 days ago \n\n&gt;Technically kids and babies are allowed on /r/aww, but they generally get downvoted to hell which I find kind of amusing. Once in a while kids can be cute or do cute things, but the newborn baby pictures are kind of gross.\n\n...\n\n\nI also suggest r/childfree for a celebration of people who are following their instincts by NOT having children. They are bucking a strong societal pressure to live their lives like they actually want to. Is this due to an increasingly rational society? Possibly. But they are not fighting their animal nature.\n\nThere is still a strong social pressure to procreate even if your circumstances make it an irrational choice, and you'll find examples of that on the subreddit. To say that higher education and industrialization (your rationality proxy) results in a lower birthrate because people are making a rational decision to not have children despite their desire to doesn't make much sense in light of Sweden. They put a lot of effort as a country into supporting parents and children http://www.oecd.org/els/family/swedenssupportforparentswithchildreniscomprehensiveandeffectivebutexpensive.htm\n\nyet they still have a birthrate comparable to developed nations that supply far less support to parents. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN\n\n...\n\nRationality doesn't seem to be causing people to completely dismiss their emotional desire to have children in most cases. All of the other factors of emotion, tradition, religion, etc are still very much at play. Perhaps more people now value the environment more highly than religious doctrine in their decision to have children, but to say that people all people who choose not to have children for an environmental reason are contradicting their instinct to do so is demonstrably false.\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI don't think the dropping fertility in the industrialized world is due to this \"hyper rationality\", because this \"hyper rationality\" doesn't seem to be manifesting in other domains.\n\nFor example, are humans even remotely rational when it comes to voting? Most seem to vote for whoever seems to be \"of their tribe\" (intellectuals, or go-getters, or soldiers or southerners, etc.) with very little analysis of policy. Or heck, just vote for whoever is tall and has a convincing smile, a nice suit, and a slogan with a couple feel-good words.\n\nOr how is watching dreck on TV \"hyper-rational\"? Or spending money on an impressive car or handbag, or doing drugs, or arguing with people on the internet, etc.?\n\nTo get back to the birth example, I think it can be explained perfectly well witjout \"hyper rationality\" - people respond to incentives, and the incentive in the modern world (especially in a city) are very different from those of most of our more fertile ancestors. Put in our shoes, they would probably also choose to have less kids, for the same reasons we do: contraception is available; living space is very expensive; education is expensive; women work; there are many more other things on which one is tempted to spend money; hardly anybody has a job at which kids can be of any help, etc.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "The two responses present distinct approaches towards the original post's argument about hyper-rationality and its impact on human procreation decisions. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - The **First Response** adopts a more conversational, somewhat informal tone while directly challenging the original poster's points.

{"index": 270, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Prescriptivism\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as \"correct\" language, that what prescriptivists call \"mistakes\" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.\n\nLinguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single \"correct\" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly \"incorrect\" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.\n\nBut. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any \"correct\" language. For example:\n\n\"He _went_ to the shops\"\n\"He _gone_ to the shops\"\n\nI can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of \"go\" is \"gone\" instead of \"went\". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:\n\n\"Shops went the he to\"\n\nThis isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than \"incorrect\"? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.\n\nSo what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as \"wrong\".

The difference is not over something like \u201cShops went the he to\u201d that nobody will say. The difference is over some structures and meaning that are commonly used and that prescriptivists will reject because their rules are not followed or the meaning is not the one deducible from etymology, or that are in practice not commonly used but that prescriptivists will try to impose because it fit in their preferred framework.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe difference is whether rules are a starting point, or a result.\n\nPrescriptivism is looked down upon in Linguistic circles because it is the linguistic equivalent of Begging the Question, because the goal, as Linguists see it, is to *find* the rules that govern language.\n\nTo draw an analogy from physics, consider what happened when the first few dozen scientists produced data that contradicted the Newtonian Model of physics. \n\nA Prescriptivist would look at data (reliable, reproducible data, collected from the real world), and declare that they are, by definition, wrong because they don't fit within the Newtonian model, and therefore the Data should align itself with the Model.\n\nThe Descriptivist looks at the data, then turns around to say that their *model* must be wrong, and that we need to find a new model, because the data indicates that it isn't quite right, and we need to create a model that fits the (real world, reliable, reproducible) data.  Thus we get Relativistic Physics.\n\nThe proper ~~deterministic~~ descriptivistic response to \"Shops went the he to\" would be to say \"Wait a second, that flies in the face of everything we know.  Is the source reliable?  Can the results be duplicated?\"  Without sufficient data, it'll likely be rejected as \"random noise,\"  because without agreement of acceptability from a community of cognitively normal, native speakers, it's not describing *language* but describing a *sentence.*\n\nHeck, the very techniques to determine the rules rely on include things like \"In this dialect, construction X is valid, but construction Y isn't,\"  because without such a test, you cannot determine whether you have correctly described the rules of that dialect.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response effectively argued against prescriptivism using an analogy from physics, illustrating the importance of data in refining language models.

Philosophically, I would disagree with putting primates in zoos since, as our closest relatives, they are very intelligent and behave a lot like us to the point that I consider them people. Bonobos are also already not allowed in zoos because they fuck all the time.\n\n2. Piggybacking off my first point, there are also a lot of others that are intelligent enough to realize that life kinda sucks for them contained in a zoo all their lives. I can't imagine putting my cat or dog in one.\n\n3. I would only agree with putting intelligent animals in zoos if it is primarily to preserve their species. A zoo is practically the only place where they would be given warmth and comfort.\n\nOf course, the problem with all my points that that, where do we draw the line on intelligence? How do we know if an animal is dissatisfied with his/her life in the zoo? I'm not totally against zoos, but liveliness and health should come first for everyone in them.\n\nSecond Response: \nLet me hit you with a dash of my philosophy, tell me what you think.\n\nAre all animal lives of equal value? If the answer is yes, then all animals should be treated equally. Zoos offer preferential treatment to certain animals, therefore they are not offering equal treatment to all animals, and are unethical.\n\nIf your answer is no, then what determines an animal's life's worth? What criteria are used to decide which animals deserve to be kept in zoos and which are not? \n\nGenerally, the more endangered a species is, the more likely it is to be found in a zoo. But species have been going extinct since long before humans were around, nature does this on its own. So zoos are in direct conflict with the natural order of life. So zoos = humans manipulating nature. We do this all the time, but generally for a practical purpose: e.g. living space, food, clothing, etc...\n\nConsidering that zoos are open to the public for general pleasure, and are only found in cities, they serve a purpose as entertainment. Is using an animal for entertainment ethical? \n\nCompare a zoo with a wildlife preserve, which is not designed for easy public access and provides a large space for endangered species to roam freely and reproduce naturally. A zoo then, is an artificial environment that only exists to provide us with entertainment. A wildlife preserve, with human assistance, would be more ethical than a zoo, as its purpose would be practical.\n\nSo a zoo is unethical, because it doesn't serve its purported purpose as well as other means. \n\n**tl;dr: Zoos discriminate against some animals, and use them solely for entertainment. If preservation is the real goal, there are more efficient ways to do so. As it stands, a zoo is just a place in the city where you can see animals not native to your region for fun.**\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Prediction: $$Answer: Second Response$$**\n\n**Explanation of Prediction:**  \nThe second response employs a strong philosophical argument that challenges the ethical implications of zoos on a fundamental level, scrutinizing concepts of equality and the underlying purposes of zoos versus wildlife preserves. This engagement with broader ethical questions encourages the original poster to reconsider not just the specific instance of zoos, but the ethical framework around animal treatment and conservation.\n\nKey factors leading to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Philosophical Approach:** The second response poses critical questions about the value of animal lives and the ethics of using animals for entertainment, which invites deeper reflection from the original poster and encourages them to confront potential contradictions in their argument.\n\n2. **Clear Structure and Readability:** The second response has a logical flow and structure, presenting its arguments in a coherent manner. Each point builds on the previous one, making it easier for the reader to follow and understand complex concepts.\n\n3. **Engagement with Issues of Equity:** By questioning the preferential treatment of certain animals in zoos, the second response challenges the original poster's underlying assumptions about ethical justifications. This engagement likely makes the original poster reconsider their stance more effectively than the first response, which focuses more on individual intelligence perceptions without delving deeply into ethical implications. \n\nOverall, the depth of inquiry and philosophical critique in the second response presents a more compelling challenge to the original poster\u2019s view.", "is_correct": true}

I've read more fiction than nonfiction so let me give some examples. \n\nIn the fiction category, I've read stephen king's \"the long walk\", \"needful things,\" and \"the shining\"; i've read pretty much all of crichton's books, and almost all of dan brown books. All are  quite popular books. \n\nFor comparison, the last 3 nonfictions I've read are [skunk works](http://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/0316743003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822539&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skunk+works&amp;pebp=1433822538925&amp;perid=1EH2CEACB9PWNS9GT84H),\" \"[the code book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Code-Book-Science-Cryptography/dp/0385495323)\", and \"[Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822683&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=north+korea&amp;pebp=1433822683392&amp;perid=11JG0BF3QCH819XQN6N9) \"\n\nSee, my view isn't that fiction is boring.

(1000 pages would take 1-2 days to read; I'd rather spend those 1-2 days watching movies or doing other time-sinking things that provides a much greater amount of pleasure). On the other hand, reading 1000 pages of nonfiction, while it would take even longer time, but it would let me get more out of it to be worth my time.\n\nCMV that reading fiction is somehow worth the time that it takes. \n\n**edit:** I've changed my view in the sense that not *all* fiction are created equal and I probably had been reading too much shitty fiction.

Adults should feel free to do what their bodies what they wish as long as they aren't physically forcing another person to do something. Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. \n\nI can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. \n\nIf you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. \n\nAnd just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. \n\nAlso, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders. It is just as bad to for a woman to tell a man he can't have sex outside the relationship as it would be if a man told a woman the same thing. \n\nSo, please. Change my view! Why should it be the norm to have monogamous relationships?\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Critics say that people shouldn't care about the lion because of all kinds of issues from racism to abortion. I haven't really followed the lion thing, that was just an example. People do this in all sorts of conversations. \n\nI find this reasoning completely flawed. Are we only going to care about the most important issue? Before we care/talk about something do we have to make sure there is no issue more important?  Also, the conversation about X is already happening. The issue is out in the open and people are passionate about solving it. This is great and a bit rare. We should roll with it when people want to make positive change instead of making them feel bad for being passionate about the wrong thing.  People have the capacity to care about more than one issue. Humanity as a whole can work together to solve more than one problem at once.

We simply can't care about every issue all the time. \n\nThere might be times when there is really important stuff going on  and people are spending all their energy and focus on things that isn't really that important. \n\nSecond Response: \nThe reason people are complaining about the killing of the lion taking up so much airspace is this: there is a finite amount of time in a day, and therefore a finite amount of time that one can spend watching/reading/hearing about/talking about news. People are not really mad that we're talking about Cecil's killing in the wake of the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose. People are made that we're talking about Cecil's killing **at the expense of** talking about the deaths of people like Sandra Bland and Samuel Dubose.\n\nNobody's arguing that the lion's death isn't tragic. People are arguing that the lion's death is not so tragic that it's worth completely ignoring yet more examples of not only police brutality but straight-up lies told by the police to cover that brutality up. We want positive change, sure, but it's good to prioritize.\n\nYou say that \"people have the capacity to care about more than one issue.\" This is true. However, people also only have a finite capacity to care about issues in general. When certain issues are shoved far enough out of the spotlight in favor of - quite frankly - more important ones, these issues stop being cared about enough to actually effect change.\n\nTl;dr: it's not that we shouldn't care about \"less important\" issues, it's that we have a finite amount of time and space and mental energy to care about issues in general.

{"index": 277, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: It doesn't make sense that saying \"bless you\" when someone sneezes is polite.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis is something that's always bothered me, all the way back to when I was a kid. I never understood why it was considered polite to say \"bless you\" after someone had sneezed. \n\nFrom my understanding, because people believed sneezing was a demon being expelled from your body, they would say \"bless you.\" Nowadays, that doesn't really make sense, and I doubt that anybody believes that is the reason people sneeze. \n\nNow I don't really care if people prefer to say \"bless you\" after they hear someone sneeze, but it's absolutely ridiculous that some people actually get upset, and will even go as far as calling someone out for not saying \"bless you\" after they'd sneezed. They simply had a tickle in their nose and their body was getting whatever particles it didn't want in the nose out. \n\nSome may say that it's similar to saying \"excuse me\" when they burp, fart, or yawn, but I disagree. Saying excuse me is a way of apologizing for being a disruption, while saying \"bless you\" is a silly way of saying \"I acknowledge that you have sneezed.\" \n\nSaying \"bless you\" doesn't make sense, and while it doesn't hurt to say, I shouldn't be ridiculed for refusing to congratulate someone on their sneeze. It becomes more disruptive than the sneeze itself and it's just silly. \n\nPlease, please CMV. I'm tired of getting shit for not wanting to say \"bless you\" but I'm also too stubborn of an asshole to conform.\n\nFirst Response: \nIt's just a modern colloquialism. You don't need to believe in god to say Merry Christmas. You don't need to view this as congratulating a sneeze, it's clearly evolved to become a modern, polite colloquialism. It doesn't mean you are saying anything about demons or congratulating a sneeze or what have you. If I said, \"Thursday was awesome\" and you agreed, are we paying tribute to Thor? The word 'awesome' also has historical use as a religious word to describe something great about god. My grandma would make fun of what she called the \"religious  nuts\" of her day who would go around using the phrase awesome in the early 20th century.  Language evolves. \n\nSecond Response: \nDo you use the word \"Goodbye\"? Even though it has its etymology from a contraction of the phrase \"God be with ye\"?\n\nIf you are looking for a perfectly rational reason as to why we say \"Bless you\" after a sneeze, you won't find one. As you have already hear from other people in this thread, it is a cultural carry over from earlier times, and we do it out of convention. \n\nSimilarly, the secular usage of Merry Christmas or Goodbye can be applied to \"Bless you\". You don't have to literally mean that you wish to bless someone in a divine sense, you can apply it as a cultural custom.\n\nOther languages have different words for a post-sneeze polite convention, but none of them are objectively useful.\n\nGesundheit (German) and Salud (Spanish) both just mean \"health\", so they are a bit more direct to the point. But even then, they don't say \"salud\" when someone coughs, only when they sneeze.\n\nIt is an illogical social custom, like many that we have, and you should just conform to it where it benefits you. If you think that you are in a situation with people that will get annoyed for you not saying it, just do.

The war in Afghanistan was fought in order to tear down a government that was actively supporting the training, funding and command and control of groups that were physically attacking US citizens and installations in the US and around the world.

The animals know that you are watching them; they feel those hundreds of curious eyes and are affected by them. No, let us have animals that don't know you are watching them, those shy creatures puttering about in their winter lairs, lying there with somnolent eyes, licking their paws and thinking. Eh?\"\n\nThe fact is, animals were not meant to be in cages. It doesn't matter that captivity is \"safer\"; the only animals that really have an understanding of what that word means are the apex predators anyway. So you have the lions and tigers and bears doing nothing but eating and sleeping. And you have the lesser animals doing the same, only they're constantly terrified because they're *out in the open.* And they're all, all of them being watched. Constantly. The hunter, used to being stealthy and unseen, is now always surrounded by noise and bustle. The hunted, used to short lives of uncertainty and frantic reproduction, grow decrepit without being able to fulfill their biological imperatives. In both cases are they hounded with unwanted attention. \n\nConservation is an important issue, and will continue to be even more so as the human population grows. More species--beautiful creatures--will inevitably go extinct. However, I don't think the answer to that problem is to round up the survivors and stick them in cages.\n\nAs a final point: a zoo could be the epitome of ethical and you'd still have the douchebags/children that come in and tap the glass, throw concessions into the cages, yell, and generally disturb the animals in the hope of getting a reaction. \n\nSecond Response: \nI actually agree with you, and could add many more reasons why zoos can be ethical, but that's not the point here so :\n\n  - endangered animals can be cared for : It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way. The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.\n\n  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.\n\nSo yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation.

The emotional weight of 'cages' and 'watching' creates a powerful argument against zoos that resonates with the human experience of empathy for animals.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response utilizes juxtaposition and stark imagery, comparing the lives of animals in the wild (who live out their biological imperatives) to those in captivity (reduced to simplistic routines).

Not to mention that she's an easy target for doxxing.\n\nThis is just a guess (because everyone's different), but I imagine that their relationship is ruined now.

Since it's clear you speak English, it also has the advantage of not having to learn a new language, and because US and (English) Canadian cultures are so similar, there will be very little \"outsider\" problem relatively speaking.  \n\nAdditionally, it's probably substantially easier to move there (if you get a bachelors you can probably move temporarily under a TN visa to try it out), and there are some other perks as well such as your Canada Pension Plan payments counting towards Social Security and vice versa.\n\nIf you want a more \"foreign\" experience than you'll get in the English speaking parts of Canada, you can also drive over to Quebec and spend some time there.  Quebec is much more different from the rest of Canada than any part of the US is different from any other part.\n\nSecond Response: \nI'm Danish. My workplace has roughly 60% foreigners from all over the world, except Africa and the middle east - not because they won't hire them, but because we get 0 applications, probably because its a tech company and people from there don't have the qualifications.\n\nSo, I know second hand from them what it's like coming here from different places in the world. Basically, the more Danish you look and act, the easier a time you will have. \n\nYou will face stigmatization if you are from Eastern Europe, since they have a bad rep among a lot of Danes, due to a lot of home robberies and burglaries committed by Eastern Europeans.\n\nIf you are black you stand out a lot, and will face a lot of fear from people, and in return sometimes being treated \"with caution\". The same probably goes, albeit to a lesser degree, if you look like you are from the middle east.\n\nIf you are American you will face some prejudices that you might be arrogant and stupid. Generally, those prejudices only come from stupid people.\n\nNot speaking Danish is not a problem if you decide to live in one of the larger cities. Danes generally do not mind speaking English, but older people in the smaller cities often have a view that if you move here, it's disrespectful not to learn the language. \n\nYou will pay a high tax. The more you earn, the higher a tax percentage. If you earn below 250.000 DKK a year, you pay 38% in tax. (These numbers are from memory, could be slightly different now). \n\nAll schooling is free, even University. You can get money to live for while studying, around 5.000 DKK a month for up to 6 years if you don't live with your parents.\n\nAll medicare is free, except dentists.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response is more likely to have impacted the original poster's view.

{"index": 282, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:The way women are portrayed in video games has no negative effect on society\n\nOriginal Post: \nI\u2019m a guy and I would say I agree with some aspects of the feminist movement, but other aspects I find silly/trivial. I\u2019m currently dating a girl who is a VERY strong feminist. Over the weekend we were playing Mario Kart 64 and for as long as I can remember my go to character for Nintendo games has been Peach. There\u2019s really no particular reason I do this other than I seem to do the best with Peach.\n\nWhen I won the grand prix my girlfriend said \u201cUgh, I hate Peach, she\u2019s such a weak and stereotypical female video game character.\u201d To which I jokingly replied \u201cWow, that\u2019s a SUPER sexist thing to say, and she\u2019s obviously not that weak since I crushed you with her.\u201d And her response to that was \u201cPeach negatively reinforces the idea that women are weak and can only be saved by men in power like Mario.\u201d\n\nThen I made the mistake of saying \u201cWell I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d We ended up getting into an argument over the portrayal of females in video games and how that perpetuates stereotypes in the real world. Her main argument was that most females in video games are portrayed as weak and need help from the male characters and this is detrimental to women in real life.\n\nThere were two issues I had with her argument, the first one being that there are a TON of badass female characters in video games who don\u2019t need no man: Samus, Rosalina, Zelda/Sheik, Palutena, Bayonetta, Lara Croft, Ellie from the last of us, and GLaDOS (just to get a female villain in there). She shrugged this off by saying it\u2019s still not enough because male protagonist characters outnumber female characters in video games. I feel like she wouldn\u2019t be happy unless the numbers of male and female characters are exactly equal.\n\nThe second, and main issue I had with her argument is even if all female characters were represented as weak and helpless, I sincerely doubt there is any correlation between these characters and real world issues for women. For me video games are make believe, fiction, and stories. They\u2019re imaginary worlds with imaginary characters. Saying the portrayal of women in video games perpetuates real societal problems for women (like pay inequality) is about as absurd to me as saying violence in video games perpetuates violence in real life, which from what I can tell [has been thoroughly debunked](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-33466-001/). Most reasonable people realize that women don\u2019t wear bright pink dresses, pick vegetables with faces out of the ground, and get kidnapped from a giant turtle/dinosaur hybrid.\n\nI provided my argument, and also said if Mario\u2019s and Peach\u2019s roles were reversed I could seriously not care less, as long as the game was still fun. Her response was \u201cYou won\u2019t ever understand because you\u2019re a guy.\u201d I tried to continue on the debate but was met with the same response every time: \u201cYou won\u2019t ever understand because you\u2019re a guy.\u201d\n\nSo here I am trying to change my view, while I may not agree with the feminist issue of women in video games, I feel like I\u2019m more empathetic than what my girlfriend is giving me credit for. Have there been studies done about the portrayal of women in video games/stories and their effects on society? Is there any hard evidence for this correlation? \n\nEDIT: Yes, I get it, some people's feelings are hurt that Princess Peach is portrayed the way she is, and while making people upset IS a negative effect, this is not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for more of an impact than \"It's bad cause ma feelings are hurt\"\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Presumably, because feminism is a thing, it makes *many* people upset. Sadness is a bad thing, so something that makes a lot of people sad has a negative effect on society, even if it's a small one. It reflects ideas and values (no one, as far as I can tell, is claiming it creates them) that are upsetting at best and offensive at worst.

The problem is that by repeating this figure they make it much harder to change, so it perpetuates it.  How much harder?

When you come back to a hierarchical thread, the new posts are spread out all over the tree. I think Reddit has a feature to show new posts since your last visit, but it's gold exclusive.\n\nLinear threads have an advantage in that all the posts appear in the same order they were made. This is important for threads discussing events while they take place (e.g. E3 conferences, sports matches or TV shows). While a real-time chat room is ideal, a linear thread will still do if you press F5 a lot, but a hierarchical thread will be very hard to follow in real time. And when you come back to one of these threads after the event is completed, the linear thread is easier to follow, since you can better understand the context of when each comment was made. E.g.\n\n* In a thread about an E3 conference, if someone comments \"this is pretty boring so far\", it's important to know if this was made before or after &lt;insert important game&gt; was announced.\n* In a thread about a soccer match, if someone seems nervous about their favourite team's chances, it's important to know if this was before or after that team scored the equalizer.\n* In a thread about a TV episode, if someone comments that they don't like the episode so far, it's important to know if this was made before or after the crazy plot twist.\n\nGames like Mafia/Werewolf are also much better with a linear thread for similar reasons - the way you interpret a comment (as suspicious or trustworthy) might be very different depending on which comments were made beforehand.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe reddit style is the reason that /r/Music is such a crappy music forum. \n\nThe way the popularity around here works means that if I want to talk about the music video for MUSE - Knights of Cydonia, I have to post a new thread and hope that people reply within the first hour or so, or it's gone. Let's say the thread gets popular, due to the multi-threading style, a lot of people are going to reply and say pretty much the exact same thing, because all the \"talking\" is spread out.\n\nThen some guy comes along 24 hours later. He sees the thread already at the top of /r/music and he wants to contribute. If he replies, MAYBE the person he is directly replying to will read it, but that's it. No one else will see it.\n\nOr a guy comes along a month later and wants to talk about MUSE. He even bothers to search and finds that thread. Replying to it is USELESS. \n\nHis only option is to start a new thread, and if he's lucky enough for it to get popular, just a lot of the same stuff from the last thread is going to be regurgitated, because everyone has already forgotten that old thread.\n\nThe ability to \"bump\" old threads on standard forums allows for more extensive discussion of topics over time.

{"index": 285, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIf movies and video games are subject to regulation and censorship, then books should be too.\n\nIn many places, especially in western cultures, the censorship of books is looked down upon. Many consider it a restriction of free speech and ideas. But why do people get upset with the censorship of books, and not movies or video games?\nIf you are under the age of 17, you are not allowed to see a rated \u201cR\u201d movie without a parent. But you are allowed to go to a bookstore and buy any book you want, no matter how controversial the subject matter. Why is it okay to censor movies and not books? Like books, movies contain ideas, messages, and provoke thought and conversation. I have seen movies that have changed my way of thinking. Most of those movies are rated \u201cR\u201d. How is it fair to restrict teenagers from experiencing the stories and ideas of this particular medium, while allowing those same stories and ideas through literature?\n\nThe same thing goes for video games. There are video games that have been banned from western countries because of content. Oftentimes, game developers have been forced to edit the content in games (depict less blood or sexuality) in order to legally sell their product in a country. This is censorship, plain and simple. They are banning art and ideas because they are controversial and make people uncomfortable. Could you imagine what would happen if we did this with books? Banned them unless the author edited, rewrote, or removed certain scenes? There would be an uproar.\n\nHere is a list of some video games that have either been censored or banned in certain countries:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regionally_censored_video_games[1]\n\nSome people might argue that we are stricter with movies and video games because you can actually see the violence rather than just reading about it. But I don\u2019t really buy this argument. In high school, I had to read \u201cThe Sorrow of War\u201d by Bao Ninh. For those of you who haven\u2019t read it, the book is extremely graphic and violent. There were vivid descriptions of people stabling and shooting each other in the face, tanks running over and crushing bodies, and torture. One of the main characters is raped in graphic detail. Profanities, including words like \u201cFuck\u201d \u201cShit\u201d and \u201cCunt\u201d are everywhere. The fact that a 16 year old is allowed and encouraged to read this book, while at the same time banned from watching 22 Jump Street in theaters alone (a movie that is rated R solely because of the language\u201d), is baffling.\n\nTo be clear, I do not agree with regulation and censorship at all. But since we enforce it on games and movies, I think that books should be held to the same standard. CMV.\n\nFirst Response: \nIf you're reading a book you have to interpret what you're reading. If you a six year old read a rape scene and have no idea what a rape scene actually entails you're probably going to not really understand what that scene is trying to depict. \n\nThe kid is protected by not having any idea as to what he is reading, so the rape scene has no context for him. He probably is protected because he can't read the thing in the first place. Books provide protection that movies and games don't.\n\nIf I show the movie Hostel to a 6 year old the violence is already really dedicated for him. That kid just has to sit back and watch. he isn't protected by his ignorance. Everything is just laid out to see. \n\nShould 6 year olds be able to watch Hostel?\n\nSecond Response: \nI think there's an important distinction between age limits and outright censorship.  \"Censorship\" in the political sense means that you are suppressing or editing a book, movie, or another work on the basis of the words and ideas contained inside it being deemed \"unacceptable\" by some authority figure.  The problem with censorship is that it abridges the freedom of adults to choose the media they consume and to expose themselves to whatever content they want.  \n\n\nMPAA and RIAA ratings, on the other hand, are age limits that apply only to children under 17.  They aren't removing these movies or video games from the marketplace of ideas, or even preventing children from seeing them.  They are just giving parents the choice about whether to expose their children to those media, rather than allowing children to have that choice themselves.  Rightly or wrongly, children under the age of 17 are under the guardianship of their parents, and our society and our legal system gives parents to make certain choices on behalf of their children until they reach a certain age.  You can argue that age 17 is arbitrary, but I think most people would agree that children below SOME age are not really capable of deciding themselves what media is appropriate to consume.  So then it's just a question of picking where the arbitrary age cutoff is.\n\n\nAge limits on books are actually quite common.  It is illegal for example, to sell erotica to children, and many bookstore chains have also adopted their own content limits in terms of what books they'll sell to young kids.  Parent groups and others will often force schools and libraries to ban certain titles (or to remove them from school curricula) for putative \"graphic content\" or political controversy.  Morally, this doesn't seem to me much different from the MPAA/RIAA rating systems; the only real difference is that it's done on an ad-hoc basis at the consumer level, rather than nationally by an industry-wide board.\n\n\nAlso, I agree with u/forestfly1234 that the layer of interpretation needed to understand graphic content in books provides another layer of protection (generally, in my experience as a teacher, kids who are old enough to understand what they're reading are usually old enough to handle the content, and the same is definitely not true of movies.)\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains a more calm and rational tone compared to the first response, which uses anecdotal evidence and emotional implications to argue its point.

{"index": 286, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The United States lost World War II\n\nOriginal Post: \nI believe that, at the end of the day, America (and to a lesser extent, the UK and USSR) ultimately lost the second World War in every way that matters.\n\nI am not disputing the fact that the United States achieved its principal military/political goals (defeat of the Third Reich and the Japanese Empire), and I of course recognize the fact that the US managed to do so with virtually no civilian casualties/ destruction of the homeland, which is especially impressive given the sheer scale of civilian destruction seen in World War II.\n\nWhat I am arguing is that, having 'won' (as much as it is possible to win) the war, the United States promptly lost its soul, and has ended up in a worse position than Germany or Japan. The reason (I claim) that this is true is because, even before the last Germans had surrendered and the war in Europe ended, the Cold War had already begun. The United States quickly exchanged one enemy (Nazi Germany) for another enemy (The Soviet Union). From 1945 to 1990-ish, combating the Soviet Union and the spread of communism was perhaps the centerpiece of American foreign policy, and led the United States into a variety of fights where we otherwise had no business (such as Vietnam), and ultimately begat a lot of hatred for the United States, leading to many of the foreign policy difficulties America now faces (particularly anti-US terrorism). The Truman Doctrine and containment strategy eventually gave way to a neoconservative 'Pax Americana' ideal, that the United States is some kind of global police force tasked with maintaining order.\n\nI think it is clear from Iraq that US military presence generally does not breed goodwill, and therefore the United States (in trying to maintain global power) has led itself into something of a downward spiral. In trying to eliminate one enemy (for example, Iran), we adopt what may seem like a reasonable strategy (arming their enemies, the Iraqis), which eventually backfires and requires later invention (the Gulf War and Iraq war), which itself leads to further issues (like the emergence of ISIS), and on and on and on. It's a cycle that only leads to cartoonishly large military budgets and American blood spilled in conflicts where we don't belong. In short, hegemony has not been kind to the United States, and we would be better off if we weren't a world power.\n\nContrast this with the Japanese and Germans, who are (arguably) doing rather well for themselves. Sure, each country was broken and defeated at the end of the war, and it took a very long time for them to recover, but they came out better. I say they came out better because neither the Japanese nor Germany have the 'obligation' to police the world. In fact, both countries forbid themselves from taking offensive military action. While these countries can be (and often are) considered 'western', and are sometimes the target of anti-western hate, they are not widely hated like the United States, and are not tasked with maintaining ridiculous global military presence. Rather (and forgive me for oversimplifying), Germany can focus on Germany and Japan can focus on Japan. One need not look long to find a wealth of statistics to indicate that these two nations have far superior social safety nets, education, healthcare, etc. than the United States. While this superiority can, of course, be attributed to a wide variety of factors, I believe that one cannot ignore the important fact that these nations have their priorities straight, having suffered the shame of defeat, having gone through the experience of rebuilding and being free of any expectation of global military prowess.\n\nWhat really solidifies this belief for me is the existence of universal health care in most of western Europe. I apologize that I don't have the source, but if I remember correctly, I remember watching an interview with a worker in the UK's NHS, who attributed the success of socialized medicine in Europe (versus the US) to the fact that Europe had to rebuild after World War II. Effectively, when you have to start from scratch and pick your life up from the rubble, there's a greater sense of common bond with the rest of your nation. The US, having not been hurt in the war in the same way, never had to rebuild and instead developed a more violently individualistic character, where the idea of potentially paying for someone else's health care is utterly repulsive. Americans, by virtue of having won World War II without civilian casualty, has ended up with a far worse society than those who 'lost'. If that's the case, aren't we the real losers?\n\nSorry if this post got long. Please, CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This placed us in a great advantage in the years after the war. \n\n Not to mention that WW2 helped get us out of the Great Depression. And it also helped to cement our alliances with Europe and Japan. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nThis is an interesting point of view, and I think it does have some merit. However, to apply your reasoning even further back, it's like saying that Germany actually won World War I because the conclusion of World War I led to the Treaty of Versailles, which through a long change of events, led to Nazi Germany, which started World War II, which, following the reasoning of your OP, ultimately led to Germany coming out ahead of the US in 2015. Perhaps you can reconcile the US achieving its principal military/political goals and Germany/Japan coming out ahead of the US in 2015 by calling it a Pyrrhic victory. But it would still be that, a victory.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post regarding the belief that the United States lost World War II, I will focus on the following stylistic elements:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is somewhat dismissive and factual. It begins with \"Interesting take,\" which is a polite acknowledgment but lacks emotional depth. The response prioritizes listing factual benefits that the US gained post-war, presenting a traditional victory narrative without engaging deeply with the original poster's emotional arguments.\n   - **Second Response:** This response displays a more open and inquisitive tone with phrases like \"This is an interesting point of view\" and \"I think it does have some merit.\" It shows a willingness to explore the original post's reasoning rather than outright dismiss it, indicating a more nuanced approach.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - **First Response:** Utilizes straightforward rhetorical techniques that focus on counter-argument based on factual advantages the US had post-WWII. The response lacks deeper engagement with the philosophical implications of the original post.\n   - **Second Response:** Engages in a broader historical context by comparing the aftermath of World War I with that of World War II. The use of terms like \"Pyrrhic victory\" introduces a metaphor that adds depth and encourages reflection on the consequences of war, resonating well with the original post's themes.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - Both responses are relatively concise and readable. However:\n     - **First Response** uses simple sentence structures and bullet points for clarity, which may make it a bit more accessible but less engaging.\n     - **Second Response** uses more complex sentence structures and integrates historical complexity, which may provoke deeper thought but could also risk losing some readability.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n   - **First Response:** Tends to engage less with the original poster\u2019s arguments, focusing solely on countering them. It does not build upon the assertion of the original content but instead redirects to the positives of US post-war status.\n   - **Second Response:** Actively engages with the original poster's argument by exploring the implications of historical events and providing potential reconciliations to their perspective. This approach invites deeper dialogue and consideration of the original post's complex narrative.\n\nIn consideration of these elements, I predict:\n\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factors for Prediction:**\n- The second response demonstrates an ability to engage more thoughtfully with the original argument, considering broader historical implications and fostering further discussion on the original post's themes. It reframes the perspective in a way that demands the original poster to reflect on the complexities of their assertions, which is more likely to change their viewpoint than the more factual and dismissive approach of the first response.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 287, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If a \"gay gene\" could be located it should be eliminated from the gene pool.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community. I have several gay friends and I am very informed about LGBT issues including transgenderism. I believe that conflicts of gender/identity/orientation etc. are innate and not a choice. \n\nI hold this belief because I feel as though this world will never be fully accepting of the LGBT community. It saddens me to see the statistics of [depression and suicide](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/gay#1) amongst youth in this group of people. LGBT kids are nearly 4x more likely to be depressed and suicidal than straight peers. The majority are bullied in school as well. Many of these people don't want to come out and have to live with this secret. Many of these people do come out and they are rejected. I understand that the world is a beautiful place because there are so many types of people. I also believe that we should make every effort to accept, love, and tolerate each other. However, we are only making these strides because people have always been and will always be born gay/bi/transgender etc. If this was not possible then this issue would never occur. Also, I am aware that many people in the LGBT community are proud to be gay. However, I can't help but feel as though they are embracing it because they have no other choice. I feel as though most (if not all) of these people must have had at least one dark moment where they felt different and wanted to be like everyone else.\n\nI would like to add that I am not supporting eugenics. I do not want to prohibit people who would be born with the gay gene from being born at all. I just want to remove the possibility of the person acquiring that gene. Furthermore, I do not wish to modify every single gene to make the perfect human beings. I am only speaking about this issue. Also, I would only encourage this if it could be done safely and would have no major side effects.\n\nEdit: My view has been changed and I am done replying. 80% of the counter-arguments were just bashing eugenics and that hardly changed my view at all. Look at the comment by /u/Miguelinileugim for a well-thought, original point.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nTHIS COMMENT\n\nisn't like the rest of this thread. Most of these can be summed up as \"Eugenics are wrong Hitler are wrong you are Hitler DIEEEEE\". This is not that kind of comment, knowing that please read further.\n\nEugenics are wrong? Whoever thinks that is extremely close-minded, the only valid argument against eugenics is the risk that it would pose for a group to decide the future of all humans, everything is else is just religious crap or Godwin's law. Eugenics is great, our genes worked great once but now they're incredibly outdated, it's like trying to run Skyrim on windows 95, it's not gonna work well. Eugenics could eliminate anything from genetical diseases and push our lifespan beyond the 120 telomere barrier to eliminating pointless hormonally-triggered violence and improving the intelligence of the population.\n\nNow your problem is the following (other than most likely there isn't a \"gay gene\" but rather some weird interaction of genes that have that effect), homosexuality is inferior to heterosexuality because it limits which people you find attractive to from 45% of the population (ie the 90% of the opposite gender that is straight/bi) to just 5% (ie the 10% of the same gender that is homosexual/bi). Everything else such as weird anatomical stuff and not being able to have children in a conventional way isn't that bad as homosexual sex is about as pleasurable as heterosexual one and artificial insemination and surrogate mothers can solve the problem of having children almost entirely.\n\nConsequently, homosexuality is bad because it limits the number of available partners, but do you know what is almost as bad? *Heterosexuality*. Fuck that crap, bisexuals have it all, they can sleep with men and women alike, they can both enjoy the 90% from the opposite sex and then 10% from their same gender, they can enjoy both genders and experience the sensations that both genders experience, they're just *objectively* superior.\n\nIt doesn't matter how much hentai you watch or how many people of the same sex you try to sleep with, the fact is that to some extent sexual orientation is genetical and you can't change it. Having a bisexual genetical profile is a genetical advantage (not necessarily an evolutive one that's why it isn't more common) as it allows people to feel attracted to more people without any downside.\n\nAnd thus, if we find a gay gene we should eliminate it, and if we find a straight gene we should obliterate it too, and instead put a bisexual gene in its place.\n\nGOD I WISH BEING BISEXUAL WAS A CHOICE BUT I CAN'T, so I'll have to stick with the opposite sex I suppose, darn my luck, but it could be worse.\n\nSecond Response: \nLogically speaking, if a \"gay gene\" exists, it would eliminate itself from the gene pool... eventually (naturally).\n\nGays don't reproduce naturally. Now if you are suggesting that gays shouldn't have the option to donate eggs/sperm in order to reproduce then you are perpetuating the culture you yourself are being demeaning off. \n\nNow let's just say you managed to change the culture associated with the hatred of the lgbt community entirely, and people really couldn't give a rats ass about who you love. In that case socio economics still limits the amount of gays that can afford to reproduce through the artificial insemination procedure. Eventually numbers would lower so much extinction would occur. \n\nAll in all, I don't believe there is a view to change here other than your approach. Since what your asking is taking place by natural selection, all I can say is your reasoning for wanting this to happen is encouraging of the existing culture to dislike the community. Your reasoning seems to accept the bad values that people hold and proposes a solution to live with those bad values. By that reasoning, if we can locate a gene that produces bigots and eliminate that, we could solve all race and discriminatory issues! Unfortunately that would leave us with hardly any humans left.  \n\nMy conclusion is that nature in this sense shouldn't be messed with. If it needs taking care of, it will take care of itself. Even cultural systems that perpetuate a bad practice for no apparent value eventually come to an end when they come face to face with a larger opposing view (I.e. Cortes and the Aztecs, or Chritians and the Moors (aka Islamics)). \n\nWhether you believe in eugenics or not, your reason advocates for it, and if you truly are sincere in not advocating it but still believe in eliminating a certain community, then at that point you really are just discriminatory towards that group and therefore not an ally as you so claim.\n\nThere is inconsistency with this post, and I hope that I've at least changed your concern towards the matter to a more cultural one that genetic one.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are based on the tone and emotional approach, rhetorical techniques, and engagement with the original poster. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more conciliatory and logical tone. It acknowledges the complexity of the argument and engages with the original poster's concerns thoughtfully. In contrast, the first response is brash and condescending, using hyperbolic comparisons (e.g., implying that opposing eugenics is akin to being Hitler) which may alienate the original poster rather than persuading them.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs logical reasoning, emphasizing natural selection and cultural dynamics in a way that encourages the original poster to reconsider their stance without outright aggression. It critiques the original poster\u2019s beliefs directly while maintaining a focus on a larger picture about societal values and consistent thinking. The first response, however, relies on satire and absurdity regarding bisexuality to support its argument, which could come off as dismissive or offensive rather than constructive.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response is relatively coherent and organized, presenting ideas in a logical flow that makes it easy for the reader to follow. The first response, while also lengthy, is often cluttered with tangents and erratic claims that muddle its main point, making it less effective for persuading someone to reconsider their views.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response engages with the underlying issues raised by the original poster and challenges them to think critically about their reasoning. It effectively points out inconsistencies without resorting to name-calling or ridicule. The first response diverges into a narrow critique of eugenics and seems to lose sight of the original dialogue, risking further entrenchment of the original poster\u2019s beliefs.\n\nOverall, these factors suggest that the second response is more likely to have successfully influenced the original poster's view, as it combines logical reasoning with respectful engagement.", "is_correct": false}

If an enemy's head is visible over an edge at distance, it may not take up enough of the player's FOV to be rendered (possibly an unlikely example). Also, the player is less able to aim in small increments. These are non-issues issue at 1080p+ resolutions. \n* UI elements (note especially the map and kill feed in the linked photo) are measured in pixels, and so obscure a HUGE percentage of available vision. This is greatly reduced by having more pixels on the screen.\n* Horizontal FOV (at a given level of distortion) suffers because of the narrower 4:3 aspect ratio. Limited peripheral vision is an obvious disadvantage that's very simply fixed with a widescreen 16:9/16:10 aspect ratio. \n\n**Warrants** (I believe that's the appropriate term) **/ Assumptions:**\n\n^(^Read: ^\"These ^arguments ^are ^either ^completely ^ineffective ^\"against\" ^me ^or ^irrelevant ^to ^a ^sponsored ^professional.\")\n\n* No hardware limitations (GPU inadequacy, etc).\n* A competitor wants every advantage available to them, especially the legal/fair ones. \n* A professional recognizes that 'their way' might not be the best way, and would readily change for the sake of improvement.\n* Access to more information is always better. \n* Greater precision is always better. \n\nSo, why would anyone play at 800x600 or 1024x768? \"Because they're used to it\" seems to be the most common answer, but I feel like that's nothing but lazy and backwards.\n\n^(Please forgive any formatting mistakes; I'm on mobile. I'll correct them as soon as I get back to a desktop.)\n\nFirst Response: \nThe fovea of your eye is a small part right in the center of your retina and field of vision. You have the clearest vision there, and it slowly deteriorates the farther you get away from there. If you want to have the best vision, you want to concentrate as much important information as possible directly into that spot. A smaller resolution allows for the entire game's field of vision to be in that small part of your eye that sees best.\n\nSecond Response: \nFor some folks, it definitely is hardware related. Not that they can't run it at max settings, but lower resolution would remove precious nanoseconds to any action they performed. As well, in your pic for example, the black border may help the player focus better. I have a cluttered desk,  and sometimes the visual 'busyness' of the desk distracts me  when game play action happens near the edge of the screen. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response is more likely to have changed the original poster's view due to its strong use of scientific explanation. It utilizes the concept of the fovea and how our eyes perceive information, creating a logical argument that directly addresses the original poster's emphasis on competitive advantages in FPS gaming. The tone is instructional yet engaging, and it appeals to the original post's technical nature.\n\nIn contrast, the second response touches upon personal distractions related to hardware but doesn't provide a robust theoretical perspective relevant to the original poster's arguments. Its less structured argument and anecdotal evidence may not resonate as strongly with someone looking for a rationale grounded in competitive performance.\n\nUltimately, the key factor for my prediction lies in the first response's effective use of a scientific basis to explain how lower resolutions might offer advantages in gameplay, aligning with the original poster's focus on competitive skill and performance.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 289, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: New York City should abolish rent regulations.\n\nOriginal Post: \nNYC currently has two schemes for limiting rent: rent control, and rent stabilization.  Both of them should be abolished, though gradually.  I would propose that currently controlled units remain controlled, but that:\n\n* Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant.  If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates.  Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely.\n\n* Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls.\n\n* Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5% per year.\n\n* Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market.  This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land.\n\n* Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis.\n\nThe reason I want to abolish rent regulations in NYC is that it drastically reduces the available housing supply and harms people looking to move to or within the city.  Anyone who has won the rent regulation lottery never moves out, and you end up with a highly inefficient allocation of apartments within the city.\n\nIt also hugely depresses the creation of new rental units within the city, because new landlords see what happened to old landlords who got stuck with controlled units.\n\nI don't think there should be a property right in a rental.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nThere's a decent arguement to be made -- and it's ably made here and several other places -- that rent laws do indeed restrict the supply of housing stock, and artificially drive up rents, as landlords just find ways to recover costs by other means. The major problem I have with decontrolling as a remedy is that (1) it will make for a painful transition period, and (2) the decontrol argument, that rents will stabilize on their own once regulation is lifted, makes theoretical sense but might not bear out in the real world. In other words, while theoretically sound, the real-world ramifications are short-term pain for long-term.... something. \n\nSo, my first push-back to you is, has this been tried elsewhere? What happened in those cities? Or, how have rents fared in cities without rent regulation? Basically: is there any *empirical* basis for decontrolling? \n\nSecond, I assume your end-goal is to increase the available housing supply, and by doing so, drive down rents or at least check the rate of rising rents. If so, there are other more politically palatable means to the same end. Chief among them, [real property tax reform](http://www.citylab.com/housing/2015/05/why-billionaires-dont-pay-property-taxes-in-new-york/389886/?utm_source=nymagFB). Today, owners of rental buildings pay disproportionately higher taxes than owners of condominiums. Naturally, rental building owners pass those taxes onto their tenants. By reshuffling the tax structure to invert that disparity, the cost of running the city could be made to fall _at least equally_ on owners of pied-a-terre's. Theoretically, owners would pass their own tax savings on to their tenants in the form of reduced rents. \n\nInterestingly, rent regulation, even in the city, is a _state_ issue. The state, which leans conservative, is more likely to repeal the rent laws than the more progressive city. But state legislators would face _intense_ backlash from downstate representatives. It would arguably empower De Blasio, too, who has otherwise been flagging, since he would look like the savior of the City against Albany's out-of-touch, careless conservatism. (I'm not saying I believe this, I'm saying it's how it would be sold.) The last thing Albany wants to do -- the _very_ last thing Cuomo wants to do -- is make De Blasio look reasonable. \n\nBy contrast, city property taxes are a _city_ issue; unlike De Blasio's \"millionaire tax,\" he wouldn't need Albany approval to cut taxes for rental property owners (and by extension the middle class) and raise taxes on luxury condo owners (the upper class). But Albany could seize the chance to continue characterizing him, however unfairly (in this case), as an un-serious politician and class warrior.\n\nWhat could be done to moot this nascent political conflict is, accomplish both plans separately, but by agreement, as a package deal that exposes neither side to political backlash. Albany, placated by the phased repeal of rent reofrm and, could forgive De Blasio his tax restructuring and promise not to fight back against it. De Blasio and city politicos, placated by tax restructuring, could forgive Albany and promise not to fight back against rent increases. In other words: while abolishing rent regulation might never happen on its own, it might happen, and be more effective, passed together with tax reform. This is not so much to change your view on the _intellectual merit_ of letting rent protection lapse, but rather, to change your view on that as a panacea. \n\n[edited last paragraph for clarity/sentence structure issues]\n\nSecond Response: \nTwo things... first if you want to move to NYC, you should know that NYC does not want you. You walk too slow, you talk too slow, you probably brought a car you can't park; much less drive. You're going to bitch and moan about prices, and eat at chain restaurants named after days of the week. \n\nTo the folks in the city... you're just an asshole. Slow when you should be fast, fast when you should be slow, and always talking shit. \n\nYou will notice on your drive into the city that the tolls are one way. This is so there is no barrier to you getting out. Seriously, there are 10 million people in the city at almost any time and only 8 million live there. \n\nNYC doesn't want you. NYC wants the people that live there to be invested in their neighborhood. Rent control does that because they know that they aren't getting kicked out because some whiter folks wanna move in. You know you can't find a less expensive place, so you look into ways you can improve or keep your neighborhood from turning into a cess pool. Barring an extreme event like the introduction of an extremely inexpensive, powerful, highly addictive drug this helps. (Although I accept that a case can be made that the permanence also encourages gangs based on territory... but tbh those happen everywhere.) \n\n\"White flight\" was not as big of an issue for NYC as it was for other cities in part because of rent control.\n\nRent control is also going to phase out on its own as those living in rent controlled apartments age and pass away. \n\nRent stabilization on the other hand is a statewide thing. It's also needed statewide. Although each municipality gets to decide if it's needed in that particular city.  First reason I can think of to answer the question of \"why is it needed?\" is the SUNY system. While most states have two or three cities for their state colleges... NY has over 60. For comparison UC has only 9. There are more people in California than there are in NY. For landlords of a less than honest and forthright disposition college students are low hanging fruit. Rent increases for sub-standard multi-unit housing because they know parents or loans are going to pay the rent, and the students don't know better. They're just happy they found a place for themselves and their 3 best friends they won't be able to stand at the end of the year. Rent control/stabilization helps to prevent these abuses. If the educated college students have issues with understanding their rights imagine how screwed poor less educated people are. \n\n\nYeah... So point one in a nutshell is that the city doesn't want you, but is willing to invest in the people that already call it home. \n\nBreak for Specific ideas:\n\n&gt; * Current units cannot be transferred to a new tenant. If the original tenant on the lease at the time of the decontrol law vacates the unit, the unit can be listed by the landlord at market rates. Currently, other occupants related to the lessor can inherit the lease, meaning units pass down in families indefinitely. \n\nSo Guy gets an apartment, signs the lease (original tenant) gets married and dies in a horrible accident.. now his widow not only has to deal with her husbands death, but her rent goes up too because she wasn't an \"original tenant\"? Damn, that's just cold. \n\nThis is the scenario that legacy rent control protects. Yes a kid might move back into their parents apartment, but generally they will have their own lives and careers by the time their parents pass away/ vacate the apartment. By keeping legacy controls vague and open, we allow for some abuse (in the opinions of some) but the cost of that abuse is still less than the cost of elimination of the benefit, and the confusion/expense created by trying to create/enforce caveats for every special situation. \n\n&gt; * Newly constructed or rented units are not subject to any controls.\n\nIn terms of specific \"rent control\"... this has been the situation for forty some odd years. Stabilization continues, but exempting new construction would encourage the destruction/reconstruction or re-habbing of existing housing in order to create New/newly rented units. Ex 10 story rent controlled/stabilized building with 200 tenants is razed to build a 15 story building that houses 300... The original 200 now need to find another home and won't be able to afford to move back into the apartment that now occupies the same space as their old home.\n\n&gt; * Rents in all controlled units can rise by up to 5% per year.\n\nConfused here as currently can't landlords petition for a change of up to 7.5% for a year? And at 5% a year.. in ten years time there will be a ~50% discrepancy between the increase in rent and inflation (using a ballpark average recent rate of 2% per year)\n\n&gt; * Rent decontrol be coupled with large scale upzoning to allow more housing to come on to the market. This will include infill construction in NYCHA housing projects where developers are willing to pay market rates for the land.\n\nHousing projects, while well-intentioned, have a serious history of segregation and exacerbating the effects of criminal activity on a community. While rent-control works by putting people from different socio-economic backgrounds in close proximity, public houses homogenizes the socio-economic backgrounds of the people living there. This is NOT a good thing for our society. A ghetto (in the classical definition not the \"black neighborhood\" definition) is essentially a combination of /r spacedicks and /r circlejerk. The worst aspects of the community have a very high short term reward at the expense of long term growth and the community in general. \n\n&gt; * Buildings which received Mitchell-Lama or other tax subsidies must pay back the subsidies with interest before decontrolling units which were built as a condition of the subsidy, on a pro-rated basis.\n\nSubsidies with conditions need to have the conditions met to continue, although allowing negotiations for a subsidy to turn into a loan existing is not a bad idea as situations change and being able to respond to that change is crucial.\n\nThe rental rights in NY and NYC specifically were created because of abuses by landlords. The \"property rights\" of a tenant were established to protect against those abuses. Todays landlords aren't more moral and caring than their 19th/10th century counterparts, and eliminating those rights will again normalize those abuses. \n\nPoint 2: \n\nWithout some form of rent control or stabilization rents would initially increase (and drastically) however the people who make the city actually run would be forced out of their homes. There would be a lag time because evictions take time, but suddenly there wouldn't be anybody to do the jobs that need doing in the city. Without basic things like the subway, trash collection, waiters at restaurants, actors performing in off-Broadway shows.. the bubble created by the elimination of controls/stabilization would pop. This would crash the market leaving the speculative landlords who were so eager to see controls removed holding worthless property. \n\nWhile it's possible that the people would just move back... it's doubtful. Look at Detroit. That is what happens to a city when it's primary draw/ industry is destroyed. NYC needs its artists and the working class that generates good artists. Those people need someplace to live that they can afford. \n\nNobody wants to go to NYC to look at a stock broker or accountant. Sorry to all those stockbrokers out there. You might be nice, but you're not interesting to watch. A broadway show.. even the cheesy trite pieces like \"Cats\" are entertaining. \n\nWhat would America have in terms of art without NYC? \n\nMark Twain, gospel, folk, country, and bluegrass. That's pretty much it. Ok... Chicago might have a claim on popularizing/ spreading the blues beyond the Mississippi flood plains, but it's hotly contested by NYC.\n\nJazz would have languished in New Orleans if it weren't for the Cotton Clubs and radio broadcasts out of NY. Punk as an idea was around for a bit, but NYC and CBGB's specifically were its physical and spiritual home.  But without the content from NY, Hollywood would have had nothing to film until the mid 70's. No Lenny Bruce, no George Carlin, no late night TV to speak of although Carson was a west coast guy the gig originated in the east. Rock and Roll didn't have a meaningful home until Alan Freed hit NYC.\n\nWithout NYC's unique combination of blue collar and upper upper white collar experiences most of the art and entertainment we know and take for granted today wouldn't exist. That isn't an exaggeration, if anything it's an understatement. Yes, Atlanta, Seattle, St. Louis, San Francisco and other cities have had some major influences in specific time periods, but we keep coming back to NYC. \n\nWhy? Because more than any other city in the country the rich and poor live side by side. Taking the same trains, complaining about the same weather, sharing the same barstools. Because rent control and stabilization are inefficient, sloppy, and have all of what you perceive to be negative effects. \n\nSo while there might be some short term benefits to the pockets of certain landlords... the long term effects will decimate the city at worst, make it bland and irrelevant at best. \n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses, we will focus on several stylistic elements such as tone, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, and engagement with the original poster.\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response maintains a mostly neutral and analytical tone.

{"index": 290, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: What we most hate in others are traits we have, and hate, in ourselves\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says \"I hate X\" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.\n\nAn important distinction: I'm talking about \"hate\" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**\n\nWhen people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires. This has become a running joke among gay acceptance (i.e. decent) people.\n\nWhen people say they hate intolerance, you'll often find they're very intolerant of views that strike them as incorrect or un-PC.\n\nNow, take something horrendously evil like pederasty/paedophilia. One of the most heinous, evil, horrible acts possible. Most people I know, however, when asked what they hate in people, don't really mention acts like that. They mention less horrifically evil things: I hate bullies, I hate hypocrisy, I hate rudeness. \n\nWe may want to kill a convicted paedophile with our bare hands, but during our day to day lives we don't think about them often or say we \"hate\" them--we save our long-term hatreds for less evil things. (This may simply be because (say) pedos are so rare and don't show up in our lives very often, or, because people don't hate that which isn't in their own psychological repertoire, or a mixture of both.)\n\nWhen I say \"I hate religious extremists\", I don't have to be religious to say it, but the underlying trait I hate may be closed-mindedness, which I may hate in myself and which I am afraid of exhibiting. I am 100% convinced I do not have a closed mind, but I cannot easily prove it. Do diehard atheists disprove the idea that what we hate most we hate in ourselves? I also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.\n\nIs it all just pop psych bs? I would like a good argument against the idea that our common/over-time objects of hate--particularly a character trait in other people--does not necessarily reflect a hatred of those traits in yourself and a fear that you will express them.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nPeople project their appearance and their personalities in everyday interaction, but can hide their past and their proclivities if need be.\n\nWe do not worry about hating pedophiles in everyday life because we don't meet someone and think, \"Ted is totally a pedophile, let's hate on him\". We do think \"Ted is super rude, let's hate him\". So the things we worry about hating in everyday life are the things we interact with the most. My aunt who works as a librarian at a federal prison has told me that she won't look up the crimes of the inmates who volunteer at the library, because she looked up one guy who she really liked and learned that he was in for murdering two women. That information absolutely affected her interaction with this man, because she thought he was a kind and helpful guy prior to knowing this. She has the potential to know the worst about the people she interacts with, something that the everyday person does not, and chooses not to do so because it is too emotionally draining. \n\nI also don't believe white supremacists are afraid that they are secretly black.\n\nDo we hate the same qualities in other people that we hate in ourselves? Yes, obviously. But I can hate rude people, and hate myself when I am rude, but not consider myself a rude person. I'm just more acutely aware of those moments that I am rude and I think about them more negatively, because it is a quality that I don't like in people. I don't go into moments of introspection when I'm being funny, or kind, or conscientious, or any of the million personality traits that I like about myself and others, even if that is how I act most of the time. I worry about the moments where I thought I was being rude because those are the moments I want to fix now and prevent in the future. I always sincerely apologize in these moments and it often negates my moment of rudeness. A rude person would not apologize or would not apologize sincerely. If you hate an act that you do, you will often hate the person who exemplifies and revels in that act. That doesn't mean that you have that \"trait\" it is just an act you do sometimes because you are human. \n\nThen there are the primary traits that we hate in ourselves but do not hate in others. I don't consider myself a rude person (although I will do something rude every once in a while), but I would say that I am an extremely anxious person. It's the personality characteristic that I hate most about myself, but I have tons of friends with anxiety and I love them more for it because we find common ground in our anxiety. I'd actually argue that a lot of religions are founded around hating traits about yourself and finding a common group that hates those things about them too. \n\nFinally there are just personalities that are completely discordant. I am a really really bad liar. That does not mean that I don't lie but I don't do it very often and it is for small things that I often to confess to immediately after telling. So I don't consider \"liar\" to be part of my personality at all, but if you look at the people who I have most actively and violently disliked in my life, they all share the common trait of being a compulsive liar. I dislike them more than rude people, which is an attribute I exhibit far more often (and some of my best friends are rude!). It is the complete difference in our personalities that makes it impossible for us to get along. Lies make me uncomfortable as it is hard for me to keep them and they are hard for me to follow. These people would rather live a life that is perceived to be more interesting while I just want someone who will be honest to me. So when I am around them I am immediately uncomfortable and I often unravel their lies in my attempt to get more comfortable. I don't call them out or say they are a liar, I just ask questions about things that confuse me in their back story because it changes the way that I assume the world works (something small like, \"I've been taking the subway 20 extra minutes all this time when there is a good spice shop at this stop?\" And there actually was no spice shop, she just bought it at Whole Foods and didn't think I cooked. WHY ARE YOU LYING ABOUT PAPRIKA!?!?!?!? WHAT IS THE POINT!?!?!). Sorry, I got sidetracked by a fictional story about paprika. Anyway, so either I'm always uncomfortable around them, which I hate, or they are always uncomfortable around me because they cannot help but lie and are always waiting for me to call them out on it. \n\nSecond Response: \nThis screams of pseudoscience to me. \n\nConfirmation bias seems rampant with it. There is twisting of language/understanding of traits that are obvious exemptions to this proposed principle of psychology. \n\nWhere is the hard evidence? Where are the experiments? This is all just sounding like mumbo jumbo guru principles that sound cool in theory; therefore it must be true.\n\nI could also just list several examples that I would find to be complete exceptions to this rule, but a large part of that is just as unprovable as the rule itself. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response\u2019s tone and emotional approach are more assertive and critical compared to the first response, which attempts to engage with personal anecdotes and explanations. The second response uses rhetorical techniques such as direct confrontation (calling the original post pseudoscience), a questioning approach that emphasizes a demand for evidence, and overall employs a more direct argumentative style. In contrast, the first response is more contemplative, providing reflective examples and personal experiences.\n\nIn terms of sentence structure and readability, the first response is longer and more complex, weaving in anecdotes which could create a narrative flow that might overwhelm the original poster.

Seems very hypocritical, no?\n\nThe point here, is that staunch liberals have a very high tendency to be hypocritical towards religion, but get really offended when a conservative does the same towards them.\n\nIt all makes no sense to me, and I want to be open to changing my belief about this one way or the other. It's a big mess that aggravates me, because no one on the far sides of the spectrum sticks to their word very well. I'm a libertarian, so I have my likes and dislikes toward each side, and I would like to understand these specific viewpoints better.\n\nEDIT: This blew up a lot more than I thought it would, which is good. I got a lot of clarification, and I've awarded some &amp;#8710;'s. To be more specific (if you're trying to step in my shoes), I USED to be a devout Catholic, until I thought some of the teachings were immoral and 'behind the times.' I just don't think that religion is a bunch of crap as some make it out to seem; however, since my view has been changed, I believe that as people should have freedom of religion, that freedom of religion can only go so far before it becomes a legal issue. I believe that freedom of religion already has a more bigoted starting point than the opposite viewpoint which is more 'realistic' shall I say.\n\nFirst Response: \nOk freedom of religion does not entail a number of things, first and foremost, you are free to practice your religion and others are free to criticize you or yes make fun of you for it (which makes them assholes, yes, but they are free to do so, just as you are free to mock non-religious people)\n\nSecond, denying a service of public accommodation to someone on the basis of religion is not allowed. This does not constitute an act of oppression.\n\nIn which ways are religious people being oppressed by liberalism?\n\nSecond Response: \nI assume the following points are correct:\n\nyou are not religious \n\nOR you do not favor your religious freedom above others.\n\nHere is my argument:\nIt is a debate between understanding of freedom. Does religious freedom stand above any other freedom? Very few people would say that. If I had a religion that said the everyone should touch a statue of Lenin everyday, could I then use my religious freedom to force that? Again very few people would say that.\nTherefore I should never have 100 % religious freedom according to any sane person, nor is religious freedom an on/off switch.\nBecause of that, I should be a discussion on how long one's religious freedom should stretch. \n\nI believe that a persons religious freedom determines that one can choose to live by religious rules, but not be able to force others to do the same. Then one would prevent others of having their religious freedom.\n\nTo put it into a clich\u00e9:\nYou can do anything as long as you do not prevent others of doing the same.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the Second Response's approach to framing the debate in a philosophical context regarding the limits of religious freedom.

{"index": 292, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Advertisements for prescription medications should be illegal\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'm very confused and bothered by the amount of ads for prescription medications that run on television and in magazines. In my mind, the reason that these medications can only be used when prescribed by a doctor, is because they are volatile substances, and only  medical expert is qualified to determine which patients really need them. \n\nI can't imagine what good these ads do. If someone is sick, she should go to her doctor, who will decide what medications will best treat her, if any. Prescription dug ads simply cause patients to think they need a drug they perhaps do not, and it puts doctors in a difficult position when their patients request a specific drug that the doctor doesn't feel they need.\n\nSo, in light of this, why are advertisements for prescriptions medications allowed?\n\nFirst Response: \nI can see 2 reasons:\n\n*  **Free speech**\n\nAt least in the US, the government's power to ban people (yes, including corporations) from saying things is strictly limited.  They can regulate the speech to require that it be true, and that it give appropriate disclaimers.  But for fairly good reasons, we don't let the government ban people from saying true things.\n\nDrug ads are commercial speech, and subject to a lot more restriction than something like political speech would be, but an outright ban would still be over the line.\n\n* **The information can be helpful**\n\nMany people have low level chronic conditions that can be treated by medication, but which don't prompt them to make a doctor's visit.  Seeing that their symptoms appear to match what's described, and that they can take a pill to help that, can materially improve their lives.\n\nSecond Response: \nThere are some cases where it makes a lot of sense.  Take Viagara for example.  Lots of people were suffering from ED which they either thought was normal (ie not a medical condition which could be treated with medicine), or were embarrassed about.  Either way they would never bring it up with their doctor without Viagara having been heavily advertised.  You could make similar cases for things like allergies, fibromayalgia, acid reflux etc.  If those are allowed, it's tough to draw the line with what is not.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the tone and emotional approach, as well as the engagement with the original poster's concerns. \n\nThe **Second Response** effectively connects with the original poster's confusion by acknowledging specific instances where advertising has played a beneficial role in raising awareness about conditions people might otherwise overlook or feel embarrassed to discuss. This relatable approach, combined with specific examples, creates an emotional resonance that was likely more impactful. The structure of the response emphasizes its practical implications and humanizes the argument, which likely enhanced persuasiveness.\n\nConversely, the **First Response**, while informative, had a more formal tone focused on legal and constitutional aspects. Although it raised valid points about the balance of free speech and the potential benefits of information-aiding health, it might not have fully addressed the emotional angle of the original post, which expressed concern about patient autonomy and physician trust. This more detached approach may not connect as strongly with the original poster's feelings of confusion and discomfort.\n\nThus, the **Second Response's** engaging and empathetic tone, along with relatable examples, likely made it more effective in shifting the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 293, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: If casting white actors/actresses as traditionally minority roles is not okay, casting minority actors/actresses as traditionally white roles should not be applauded either.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis is something I've been struggling with for a while. There have been a few headlines lately that brought this topic up, namely about the new [black Human Torch in the upcoming Fantastic Four reboot](http://comicbook.com/blog/2014/02/22/fantastic-four-why-casting-a-black-actor-as-the-human-torch-might-make-a-better-movie/), and the casting of [Emma Stone as Allison Ng in *Aloha*](http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/03/entertainment/cameron-crowe-emma-stone-aloha-apology-feat/). Now, I know both of these examples aren't perfect opposites, but the reception has been wildly different. When Michael B. Jordan was cast as the new Human Torch, people were thrilled. Despite the Human Torch [never once being black in the comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_versions_of_the_Human_Torch), people said this was a good step forward in the superhero film community, and even that changing the typically white role to an black role would add levels of complexity to the story. On the other hand, critics called Stone's casting \"culturally insensitive,\" despite Cameron Crowe stating that the fact she's predominantly white, and has to constantly explain her \"unlikely heritage,\" was an actual aspect of her character, based on a real life redhead with 1/4 Chinese heritage.\n\nI don't mind casting people of color in typically white roles. I think it's good and it should be as inconsequential as POC involvement in other areas of life in the 21st century. In fact, in areas dominated by white characters, like the Marvel Universe, I'm completely open to the idea of adding more roles for POC. But when usually white roles are filled by POC, there's a lot of praise for reaching out and involving other races. Why not just focus on either creating films that feature black or other minority characters, like the [Black Panther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Panther_(comics), or even start creating more original POC characters to reflect the changing racial landscape? Why is the casting itself of a mixed race character portrayed by a white actor \"insensitive?\"\n\nI'd love to hear other thoughts. I've only seen these two issues (minority casting of white roles and white casting of minority roles) tackled separately.\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

The first is... what's a 'traditionally white' role?\n\nSecond... along the lines of the logic behind affirmative action... which is to say that it's socially important for POC (to use your term) to be seen in positions of power and respect because it promotes the normalization of equality. Where there's a role that is not race-dependent, it's good to be reminded that POC have all the dimensions we have seen white actors depict.\n\nThird... so what? The thing about drama/theater is that there can be, for better or worse, reimaginings and re-stagings, all to provoke different reactions and emotions in the audience. That's what drama is about. Don't you think it's *interesting* that someone could stage, say, Othello with an all black cast except for a white Othello? It would absolutely be provocative (and probably has been done before) and that's the point. If that kind of staging would be a problem for you, then I think that the artistic license has done its job of holding a mirror up to humanity so you can see all your human imperfections.\n\nThe great thing about are is that as much as it can be imagined, it can be reimagined, and it only enriches the work and the experience. You have to let go of the 'definitive' as a desirable quality... it will enhance your appreciation of all things.\n\nSecond Response: \nDoes the Human Torch's whiteness have any impact whatsoever on his character? Black Panther, and many other non-white characters, were explicitly made non white because their race had some connection to their character. The Human Torch in this movie is black. He's not a black actor playing a white character, he's a black actor playing a black character.\n\nMeanwhile, Stone's casting was a white person being cast as a character with non-white heritage, a role which should have gone to a person of similar heritage to the character, because white people can get cast as explicitly non-white characters but PoC can't get roles as explicitly white characters. So Stone was taking away a rare opportunity from actors of that heritage, Jordan was not.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the engagement level and clarity of the argument presented in the second response.

I more or less quit responding because a couple people effectively changed the way I was looking at the issue. To be honest though, I don't think I'll come back here again. I wanted to have a discussion, and it was nice to talk with some of you, but I don't have enough comment karma to spare for all the downvotes I got when responding to comments. That seems to be a theme in most posts in this sub. \n\nLike I said, I appreciate all the responses, and a big thanks to those who took the time to respond to me and add sources and information to back up their reasoning.*\n\nI'm really struggling with this one, CMV. This is my first post here. Reading through threads concerning this issue here on Reddit has made me wonder if I'm just a heartless jackass or not since it appears most of Reddit goes against the grain with me on this issue here. \n\nI don't feel like it's wrong to drug test welfare recipients. I agree somewhat with the view that if I am required to pass a drug test to even have a shot at a job, a welfare recipient should have to do the same to receive assistance which they're not required to work for. I've heard that a 30 day rehabilitation option is offered in some states for people who test positive, and benefits are cut off for those who refuse that option. I don't agree with punishing someone for addiction and not offering help, but if the drug testing states implemented this policy, I don't think I'd see any problems with it at all. \n\nI feel this way because I've been in a lot of situations where this has been a relevant issue. Cashiering for a small town grocery store growing up, knowing the people using food stamps at the counter, and also knowing that the majority if them are using drugs (small town) helped me form an opinion early on. I didn't think it was fair that at 16, my tax money was being used to help someone pay for food when they spent their money on drugs. If they wanted food, why not by it instead of drugs? Of course, now that I'm older I realize that not everything is so black and white, and that this goes deeper than my 16 year old opinion. \n\nI'm a home health nurse that works with pediatric patients in their homes. My patients are almost always in very poor, run down neighborhoods. All of these families are on food stamps and government assistance (my nursing contract is paid through their Medicaid) and literally, out of the last 10 families I've worked with, 4 of the parents used some kind of drug in front of me, and at least 3 more parents were very obviously using drugs. I'm not counting alcohol or tobacco use either, just what's actually being tested for. \n\nI have compassion and empathy for people, and I'm very left-leaning on most issues. I'm 100% for human rights, and I try to imagine myself in other's shoes before forming an opinion, but this is something that I just don't see a problem with, especially if rehabilitation is an offered option. I've also struggled with my own habits and addictions to alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana. I realize not all people are the same, but any time I've needed a job badly enough, I've been able to kick the weed and nicotine long enough to pass a pre employment screening. I feel like that's my responsibility, and that plays into why I've formed the opinion that I have.\n\nSo help me out, CMV. Change my view.\n\nEdit: I should also probably note that I understand the low statistics on how many people actually do end up popping positive in these tests, and I realize that it's costing a lot of tax money to do so. I don't think it's a waste of tax payer money if these people are being offered an option to be rehabilitated. \n\nFirst Response: \nThe main reason I am against drug testing welfare recipients is because to me it violates the 4th ammendment which protects people from unreasonable search and seizure. I fall on the side that because you need welfare is not a good enough reason to be subject to a search of drug use through a drug test. It is a tough moral issue either way though. You also need to remember that it isn't difficult to cheat on a drug test and that many of these people aren't actually using drugs. There will always be a percentage that takes advantage of welfare but it is usually small. By drug testing it does end up costing the taxpayer more and doesn't really resolve the issue of getting these people off drugs and into a lifestyle they can be successful in. All it really seems to do is make it harder to pull themselves back up.\n\nSecond Response: \nMost drug users aren't addicts.  Most addicts are still good parents.\n\nThere is a pretty big intersection in the \"bad-parent/drug-addict\" venn diagram, but one still doesn't imply the other.\n\n________\n\nIt sounds like you're more upset that these people are wasting taxpayer money.\n\n\nIf I blow my entire cheque on DVDs, shoes or drugs - the effect is the same.\n\nWhat, really, is the difference?  \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the substantive engagement and depth of the first response.

We can observe the effects of gravity on earth, and the effects of gravity in our solar system near Mercury. If we say that the laws should be the same everywhere, then we notice what we observe on earth is not true for Mercury. If scientists assume that gravity should work the same everywhere, then either our observations of Mercury are wrong or our understanding of gravity through Newton is wrong. Because of further exploration into gravity, Einstein resolved these issues with relativity and showed our observations of Mercury were correct, while our theory of gravity was incomplete. \n\nHowever, if scientists assume that maybe the laws of the universe don't work the same everywhere, then there's no reason to search for a new theory. Saying, \"that's just how it works over there\" is not science, it's a cop out. It's giving up and not searching for some unifying or universal theory that connects all observations. \n\nHence the search for the theory of everything, or some theory that unifies quantum mechanics and relativity. The search is on the basis that there should be uniformity in the universe, the laws that govern the small should be the same that govern the large. If scientists don't assume uniformity, then the search is baseless. \n\nSecond Response: \nScientists, as far as I know, have to assume uniformity or all the scientific theories fail. The thing is though, none have failed for that reason, so they really have evidence by now.\n\nBut if the universe would change in how it behaves, they would change their view.

I am not saying anything against this definition. If the experts want to define things this way, I'm certainly in no position to say otherwise.\n\nHowever, \"Black is a color\" should still be a valid statement. My shirt is 'black.' I'm not a color-physicist, but I'm almost certain that it does not completely absorb the full spectrum of colors. If I wanted to be totally correct, I would have to say: \"My shirt is a color that very nearly approximates black.\" (Disproving this would be a very easy way to CMV!)\n\nThere are enough black-colored items in the world for this to be ridiculous. Thus, it's only logical that when we are casually talking to other humans, and mention the word 'black,' it can be assumed that we're referring to this close-enough faux-black, which does reflect (I'd assume) some light, and thus is totally a color. \n\nThe argument for white follows similarly.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying that it's wrong to say that black and white aren't colors. I'm saying that it's okay to say that they are, in certain contexts.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This means that different communities define things differently in a way that suits their own needs. When artists talk about a painting needing more colour, other artists will intuitively know that this means add colours that are not black or white. If they all assumed \"colour\" included black and white that conversation would be way more confusing for everyone involved.\n\n\nIf your day to day life involves talking about colour all the time, you should have an established definition of what counts as a colour so everyone's on the same page. At the end of the day it doesn't matter, it's just to ensure proper communication.\n\n\nSo when they say things like that, it's just an arbitrary distinction that has been made for their sake. Not sure if I've changed your view, but maybe I've atleast shown you why they would do that, and why it's okay to do that\n\nSecond Response: \nPick a color, any color, a bright one. Red, blue, brown, violet ... Now desaturate it a bit. Still the same color. Sometimes with a different word for it, like pink for desatured red, but it's obviously the same color. Now desaturate it more. And more. It's now very light, but you can still see the color. \n\nDesaturate it to the max. It's white. No matter what color you start with. \n\nOk let's try again, pick a bright color. Now reduce luminosity. It gets darker and darker, you can still see it's the same color ... until you reach black.

The first response, while logical, uses a more formal tone that may come off as clinical and less engaging.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response uses a series of progressive analogies that walk the reader through the concept of color deconstruction.

{"index": 297, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: X is better than Y\n\nOriginal Post: \nClearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. \n\n1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to \"why.\"\n\n2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in \"ly\" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.\n\n3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. \n\n4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). \n\n5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. \n\n6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. \n\n7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. \n\n8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even \"American History X.\"\n\n9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, \n\n10. = X. \n\n11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. \n\n12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say \"X is better than Y,\" never \"Y is better than X\". \n\n\nEDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

For instance you presume that rarity is 'better' than versatility.  The letter Y is far more versatile than the letter X, it can be used in many more words and is flexible enough to stand in for vowels when using them makes a word look horrible.  On that basis the letter Y also has great aesthetic appeal.\n\nYou assume that consistency is better when versatility could just as easily be argued to be better.\n\nYou assume that having the word ex in sex is good, but in order to describe the magnitude of sex something exudes you need to add the y on the end (sexy).\n\nNumber 11 is just plan false as I'm sure many people die each year in Texas, and New Mexico.\n\nSecond Response: \nI see a lot of people here falling for the false-dichotomy trap. I want to take a different approach.\n\nWhile X may be better than Y, I want to change your view that this is irrelevant. M is superior to both, and that is more important in your life.\n\n1. Pronunciation. M is easy to say, not too harsh, not too soft. Saying, \"Mmmmm\" describes deliciousness. It is so great that it is often the first sound a baby makes.\n\n2. Restrained Popularity. M is a pretty popular letter, but not overused. It is right around the middle of the [letter frequency chart in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_the_English_language). M is a common but not overused first-letter as well, in part because it is such a pleasant sound to make. Mmmm. Furthermore, while neither X nor Y are present in all languages, M is universal on [this chart on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#Relative_frequencies_of_letters_in_other_languages), and it retains a solid medium frequency between 2% and 5%. Used, but not overused.\n\n3. Consistency. M is also always a consonant. X cannot make up its mind regarding the sound it makes. Zuh? Chi? What is it, X?\n\n4. Scrabble. M, with its restrained popularity, is a happy tile to come across. You get a middling number of points (3) but what you lack in points you more than make up for in usability. Sometimes you can even use more than one M in the same word! Can you say Double Letter Score? Thanks M!\n\n5. Use in math. M is the first letter of the word math. You are welcome. End of discussion. \n\n6. Appearance. M is such a beautiful form that we have modelled other letters after it: W is an upside-down M with some sharpness and E is a sideways M with some flatness. We even find the influence of its beauty in numbers as 3 is a sideways M with more roundness. Marvellous.\n\n7. Sex. Mmmm, sex is good. How do you get sex? Money. Boom.\n\n8. History. Malcolm X, not Xalcolm X. History museums, not xuseuxs. The second millennium, not xillenniux. You practically cannot even say words with X properly.\n\n9. Versatility in other areas. Without the M in medicine there would be no x-rays, and without a \"M\"ap there would be no treasure.\n\n10. \u2260 X\n\n11. What is the best school in the world? Harvard. Where is that? Massachusetts. Thanks brains.\n\n12. When one understands the value of M there is no need to talk about \"unknown items\". You know M, and M is all one must know.\n\nBonus: If you search for \"M is the best letter\" on Google you will find about 610,000,000 results. \"X is the best letter\" returns a paltry 560,000,000 results (not to mention \"Y is the best letter\" at a pitiful 392,000,000 results)  \nM is the head of M6 in James Bond.  \nThe Christian God picked a woman named \"M\"ary to bear his son.  \nThe Hindu Mahabarata starts with \"M\".  \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the First Response's direct engagement with the original poster's specific arguments.

I really liked them and purchased the A Song of Ice and Fire books and loved them even more. Now, when I watch the new episodes or go back and watch those ones I initially liked it feels different. \n\n* The show now seems like a rookie film students first attempt at portraying the book. The acting, budget, and sets all seem fine. Things like staging, dialogue, character's appearances and the plot's movements seem very obvious and amateurish. \n\n\nAt first I played it off with rationale like, they have budget issues, or it's just harder to portray these complex scenes on television, or that they needed to shorten the storyline to fit it in a ten season show.  Now I am starting to feel like the show's creators are really just amateurs. They are using the \"best\" books in the last two decades so of course the show is popular. But if someone without their rapey suckage had control, could it be that much better?\n\nPlease change my view so I can enjoy the show again. \n\n**I think to accomplish this someone has to either just absolutely school me on film knowledge or make me feel good about the fact that they didn't have a choice for toning basically everything down. Maybe I'm asking too much, if so I apologize.\n\nTranslations of my words for clarity.\n\nRapey suckage - using sexual violence in ways that seem to be more geared towards shocking the audience than furthering the plot. I'm actually thinking more of the rape scenes for Dany and Cersi.\n\nStaging - there is no subtly to the character's positioning in frames. As someone who is only a casual film observer I prefer a show like Breaking Bad where I have to watch it a second time to finally be able to see the importance of things like a character's positioning on camera. GOT seems amateurish when compared.\n\nDialouge - too many corny phrasings and catch phrases (especially when they use modern idioms). I am currently trying to find a script online so I don't have to transcribe scenes to give you examples. They also do a poor job introducing characters and have to make up for it by having character's say their own names all the time\n\nCharacter's Appearance - Why can't people have the long hair and beards they are supposed to? Legolas had hair down to his waist and he was still a sex symbol. I know Tyrion can't really have his nose chopped off but their first casting or Daario left my head spinning.\n\nPlot's Movement - Given that they are cutting half of the books out there shouldn't be so many complaints out of non-book readers that the show is boring. Or is the general public just that impatient?\n\nEdit 3 - added a question mark\n\nEdit 4 - Maybe this context will help someone to see another angle to change my view to. I have a cousin who watched the show and read all the books who insists the show is better than the books but never gives me reasons. What could his argument possibly be?\n\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt; They are using the \"best\" books in the last two decades so of course the show is popular.\n\nI'm not quite sure what the quotes around best are meant to imply, so maybe I'm preaching to the choir here, but I think you'll have a tough time finding that many folks who are that Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons were even close to the top books in the past decade. I liked them personally, but I know quite a few people who quit reading around book 4. And there's really not much about those books that screams \"make a tv show about me\". Its about horrible things happening to children, has a HUGE cast, spans multiple continents, has main characters that never meet each other, etc... A lot of things that work great in books have a huge degree of difficulty adapting to TV. So however you feel about the fins product, I think the creators deserve at least a little more credit than you're giving them.\n\n&gt;But if someone without their rapey suckage had control, could it be that much better?\n\nSo, I do want to ask... How much of your frustration is based on the end of the last episode, plus a handful of other scenes throughout the series? I think the show is awesome, but I absolutely think they've done a poor job depicting certain topics. Mileage may vary as to what extent these issues sour ones enjoyment of the show as a whole. But this discussion could go in quite a few different directions and it might help to focus it a bit.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe books experienced a very significant change in pace after the third book. Regardless of whether you liked them or hated them, they introduced many new characters in multiple new regions, had to catch up with all of the previous characters, and provided more backstory about the world that was essential to understanding all of the plotting and magic that was going on. The last two books had a lot of jobs to do involving introduction, and the introductory parts of characters are rarely the most interesting (especially in a series where the audience can take multiple seasons to warm up to characters). The fact that the show hasn't slowed to an absolute crawl while adapting this much slower material already elevates it above the books in a certain respect. \n\nAs for your points:\n\nRapey suckage: Dany's rape scene doesn't substantially differentiate her from the books. Frankly, that scene in the books was still rape (if you give a 13-year-old girl to the general of a massive barbarian army and have her try and say no, it's probably not going to work), so the books don't stand up comparatively. The rape even served a purpose, highlighting the starting point of Dany's journey from powerless to powerful. Cersei's rape in the show wasn't even supposed to be a rape (just a thoroughly appalling sex scene), so I hope we can chalk that up to bad editing. The most recent rape scene is still too fresh to fairly judge (for all we know, it works perfectly into the context of the rest of the season). \n\nStaging: There are definitely notable uses of good staging, but I will admit that Game of Thrones can be lackluster in this respect more often that I'd like. To be fair, Game of Thrones does strive for a certain level of realism (as best as a show with dragons and zombies can). The prosaic staging could be seen as adherence to this guideline, with the director not distorting our perceptions of the characters to make the fantasy world seem more mundane and relatable.\n\nDialogue: Yeah, they can't all be winners. The writers for the show have to deal with a massive handicap though: they need to convey the books' storyline and characters, when their main viewing audience has the attention span of a goldfish. Maybe you didn't suffer from this, but among the show watchers I know, if a character doesn't show up for a few episodes, they will likely forget their name (if they even knew it in the first place). It's so much harder to keep track of all of the character names, faces, and relationships when you can't flip back through the text to see who's who, and the dialogue has to do a lot of the heavy lifting to make these things understandable to the mass audience. This is basically a necessary consequence of a big budget adaption. If it helps, pretend the modern idioms are part of a Translation Convention.\n\nCharacter's Appearance: There are plenty of characters with long hair and plenty more with beards. A lot of the book descriptions would just be comical if you tried to use them straight (Targaryen purple eyes, Daario's blue beard, hyper-blonde Lannisters).\n\nPlot's Movement: The problem isn't that they're cutting a lot out that was in the books; there was a TON of non-plot relevant stuff in the books in the first place (even weeding that out is still a lot). This is absolutely a necessary consequence of an adaptation. Non-book readers have no idea how fast they're moving comparatively. The show also occasionally has to check in on characters that haven't showed up in a while, even if they're not doing anything plot important, just so viewers don't forget they exist (goldfish memory). This is why Yara keeps popping up, even though she's done nothing of consequence since season 2. Finally, the first half of every season always tends to be set up. Season 4 is the lucky exception because it basically picked up in the middle of the most intense part of the entire book series, so this season probably feels exceptionally slow coming after that.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post regarding \"Game of Thrones\" and its adaptation from the books, let's break down the stylistic elements of each response.\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- **First Response:** This response maintains a somewhat defensive and challenging tone, aiming to engage the original poster by questioning their assumptions and providing counterarguments. It seems to adopt a more casual diction, which might resonate with some readers.\n- **Second Response:** The tie-in with the original post is deeper, and its tone is more analytical and explanatory. It acknowledges the original poster's feelings but provides a balanced view, striving to clarify the complexities involved in adapting such a layered series. \n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- **First Response:** The first responder uses questioning to provoke thought and action from the original poster, but less so in a supportive manner. It doesn't offer much emotional reassurance or attempt to validate the original poster's feelings regarding the show's shortcomings.\n- **Second Response:** This response employs more extensive explainers and reasoning, addressing each of the original poster's points systematically. it aims to dissect misconceptions and gently guide the reader towards appreciating the adaptation's challenges. \n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- **First Response:** The structure here is more conversational, with shorter sentences and a more fragmented style. This can make it easier to follow but it risks oversimplifying complex arguments.\n- **Second Response:** This response contains more complex sentences and a structured argument, which may require greater focus to understand fully. However, it provides a detailed exploration of ideas that may influence the original poster\u2019s perceptions.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- **First Response:** Engagement is somewhat limited; while it asks questions, it primarily serves to rebut the original poster's arguments without significant emotional engagement or affirmation.\n- **Second Response:** Engagement is higher in this response. The respondent not only addresses the original poster\u2019s concerns directly but also provides substantial context and insight. This comprehensive approach caters to the original poster's plea for understanding and shifts the focus towards potential appreciation of the show's production choices.\n\n**Prediction:**\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n**Key Factors Leading to Prediction:**\n1. **Depth of Engagement:** The second response engages deeply with each specific concern raised by the original poster, offering thoughtful explanations that acknowledge the poster's feelings while also introducing a broader perspective. \n2. **Clarity and Rationality:** By systematically addressing and dissecting each point, the second responder employs a reasoned approach that is more likely to resonate with someone seeking to alter their viewpoint effectively.\n3. **Validation and Perspective:** It balances validation of feelings with more extensive context about the production challenges, which can help the original poster feel understood while also broadening their perspective to appreciate the complexities of the adaptation process. This method is more likely to change a person's view positively compared to the first response's somewhat combative tone.", "is_correct": true}

Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.\n\nI consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.\n\nThe extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.\n\nIt seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nCould that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?\nChange my view.\n\n\n\n_____\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted\n\nWhere do you live? In my country there is no age restriction on it (or at least none that I know of) and kids usually don't desire coffee.\n\nOther then that. There are persons that actually like the taste of coffee, even the pure one. I for myself love a good black coffee or espresso (I hate those weird Starbucks things though). I think those pure coffee drinkers like me are mainly those that also like spicy and intense tastes in general. That's also the reason for the hate on Starbucks, their coffee mixtures taste just far too weak.\n\nThere is also a strong effect of coffee, at least if you drink a lot.\nI always feel very energized (and admittedly a bit too nervous) after drinking a jug of coffee.\n\nSecond Response: \nOn top of what's already been said, the reason why 'espresso connoisseurs' hate Starbucks is because they burn their beans (over-roast them) which produces a strong bitter taste, and then they overload it with sugar to mask the bitter taste. This is fine if you don't like the taste of espresso\n\nStarbucks is like it's own subdivision of espresso centered a bit more around the sugar. And that's fine, and clearly tons of people enjoy it enough to make it the large enterprise it is. But the people who've had and loved actual espresso, and learned to enjoy the taste of it, will be shocked upon trying Starbucks to find that the espresso part of the drink tastes like shit, and there's way too much sugar. It'd be like enjoying fine local craft beers all your life, then being thrown a Bud Lite. Sure, Bud Lite is popular, but it doesn't have what someone who enjoys craft beer is looking for. Or lets say you grew up having fresh, delicious hamburgers from the cows on your farm along with fries from potatoes you grew at home, then you had a McDonalds Big Mac. Shit, I love myself the occasional McDonalds, but it scratches an entirely different itch than homemade hamburgers and fries.\n\nI know I'm sounding pretentious. I really have no problem with Starbucks.

It seems to dismiss the original poster's claim about the desire for coffee, focusing more on personal experience. However, it's slightly defensive, as it asserts that kids in their culture don't desire coffee in the same way.\n- **Second Response**: This response adopts a more analytical tone, as it provides more context regarding coffee and Starbucks, acknowledging that tastes differ. This approach feels more respectful to the original poster's experiences and attempts to explain rather than simply dismiss.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques:\n- **First Response**: The rebuttal mostly rests on personal anecdotes without much supporting argumentation. It refutes with personal opinion but lacks a broader appeal or persuasive technique.\n- **Second Response**: The second responder employs analogies (comparing Starbucks to Bud Lite and McDonald's) to convey their point, which effectively illustrates the difference between commercial coffee and what they perceive as \"real\" coffee. This technique is likely to resonate with the original poster.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability:\n- Both responses are easy to read, but the second response is more cohesive and structured. It reads like a flowing argument rather than disjointed points. The use of analogies helps in understanding the preferences and perspectives around coffee.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster:\n- **First Response**: This response engages minimally with the original poster's points and does not explore deeper into the arguments presented. It feels more like a personal critique than a discussion.\n- **Second Response**: It engages deeply, addressing specific points raised by the original poster. The responder acknowledges the original point about taste while providing an opinion grounded in taste experience and industry insight.\n\n### Prediction:\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation:\nThe second response is successful in potentially shifting the original poster's view due to its respectful tone, use of solid analogies that clarify the argument, and deeper engagement with the original poster\u2019s sentiment regarding their coffee experiences. By providing a well-rounded perspective explaining why some might dislike Starbucks, while also validating that preferences in taste can vary widely, the second response offers a better chance of changing the original poster\u2019s view on the cultural appreciation of coffee.", "is_correct": false}

You're saying that that patriotism may be better than no patriotism, but that no patriotism would be one great community and society?\n\nFear and prejudice are not the products of patriotism, they're a fact of being human. Our minds are not and never will be unbiased, but patriotism helps.\n\nPatriotism is what lets us accept anyone as our partner in being human, in my opinion. Patriotism is what lets us say that we like the other Americans, the other Germans, etc--society without patriotism is not one great society, but no society, because without some belief in the groups that we are a part of, why would we be a member of them? One global society is universal human patriotism, not it's removal, and the removal or patriotism is no society at all, something where whom we associate with is based solely on those prejudices, rather than the other way around.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think it helps to distinguish patriotism from nationalism. Patriotism could be defined as allegiance to the best hopes and ideals of your country.

I certainly think this is the case with most medium to large size mammals like cats, dogs, pigs, chickens, dolphins and whatnot. For that reason I wouldn't eat those animals even if it was sustainable to do so, unless I was sure they had been reared and killed humanely.\n\nWhen it comes to animals who are clearly less conscious I don't feel the same way. I don't have any qualms about swatting flies, and I also recognise the need for pest control. I wouldn't have any problem with lethal rat traps being used in a restaurant (although obviously that should go hand in hand with taking measures to discourage them being in the kitchen in the first place like not leaving food out overnight).\n\nI don't know if fish can experience pain or not.

I've been interested in this issue for about a year and this seems to be the best resource on it. The authors look at several studies done on the issue and conclude that there's no convincing evidence that fish experience pain. Most importantly, it looks like they lack the brain capacity to actually feel pain (which is a psychological thing, not a physiological one).\n\nAlso, not your main point, but if you care about animals dying/suffering, [being a vegetarian might be worse than being an omnivore.](http://measureofdoubt.com/2011/06/22/why-a-vegetarian-might-kill-more-animals-than-an-omnivore/) As vegetarian you generally eat more eggs and dairy products as meat replacements. Unfortunately, more animals are killed to get to the same amount of calories that you'd get from meat. Chickens used for eggs are killed pretty young (and are treated worse than chickens used for meat). For dairy, lots of calves are killed (especially male ones) because they have no economic value apart from their meat.\n\nSecond Response: \nDon't know if this will be helpful to you or not, but the best research we have to date would suggest that fish do not, in fact, feel pain.

You may not think Chrome looks good, but others would say that it does. It really comes down to personal taste.\n\nYou also have to give Chrome a lot of credit for pushing the state-of-the-art in Web and Web browser development. Before Chrome came out in 2008, the Web was an incredibly difficult platform to develop on. A majority of the Web's users used various forms of Internet Explorer, with a much smaller population using Firefox. And even as far as browser design was considered, it was All Toolbars, All The Time (modeled after IE6).\n\nChrome really shook up browser design, in a very big way. With tabs in the window header, people had a LOT more vertical viewing room, which made browsing the Web better. Along with browsing, having better support for new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features allowed developers to build beautiful, performant websites without using external plugins (like Flash and Java). This gave way to Responsive Web Design, allowing pages to look good no matter what device the user is browsing with.\n\nFinally, on the subject of memory use, Chrome is a hog for a reason: security. Chrome was the first browser to have Tab Sandboxing, which means that each browser tab spawns its own operating system process. Should the tab crash for some reason (Flash fails to load, page can't be reached on the server, etc), it won't bring down the entire browser. Also, code running in one tab can't access the data in another tab; they're accessing entirely different sections of memory. That all comes at a cost, however: with more tabs open and more processes running, more memory is being used. That's less of a concern now since users are commonly using machines with 4+ GB of RAM, but it can still bog down the rest of the machine since the OS has to page memory in and out of disk swap (but now I'm getting far too technical). Extensions as well also operate in their own process, so the more extensions you have installed, the more memory you're using.\n\nAs I said in the first paragraph, I don't expect this explanation will change your mind. However, it's important to know the design decisions the Chrome dev team made, and how it impacted the rest of the Web. Most other browsers look/operate like Chrome because Chrome pioneered a far superior way of doing things, and other browser vendors followed suit. I've only scratched the surface of what Chrome has done (their v8 JavaScript VM, WebRTC, SPDY/HTTP 2.0, rapid development cycle, WebM, etc etc etc). Point being, Chrome is very much on the forefront of Web and browser development. Google employs a LOT of brilliant people to work on this product, and it shows. Just because the browser's design has stabilized isn't a sign that it's slowing down; rather it's a sign that others are catching up.\n\nSecond Response: \nOne thing that seems outright ignored here:\n\n&gt; Saying that you use Chrome means nothing anymore, and might as well use IE (or the incarnation Spartan)\n\nIf you mean it's unremarkable because Chrome is so popular, is that a bad thing? Plus, Chrome is mostly Chromium, which is open source. There is no version of IE which can say that, and if IE and Chrome were in all other ways equal, I'd choose the one that's more open.\n\n&gt; Edit: Also the memory usage by Chrome is crazy. I can't comment on the memory usage by Firefox haven't used it that much\n\nI agree that Chrome needs to improve memory usage, but I don't think you're doing a fair comparison. Not entirely your fault, because it's *hard* to do a fair comparison. You'd basically need to import all your bookmarks and history and such back into Firefox, find Firefox equivalents for all your Chrome extensions, open the same webpages in the same order, and so on...\n\nEven then, you'd need to use Chrome's task manager to measure how much memory it's using, because the Windows Task Manager (or the OS X Activity Monitor, or just 'top 'on Linux) often massively overestimates it. Like the top poster says, Chrome has this multiprocess model. Those processes still share a lot of memory, so the OS is double-counting that. (Or triple, or quadruple...)\n\nAt the end of the day, I think Firefox still wins. But it's not as insane a difference as people think. I think probably half the reason people think Chrome RAM is ridiculous is that it's the browser they're using.\n\nThat said, I agree with at least some of the sentiment here -- I miss the days when Chrome was so obviously faster than everything else that Google was [showing off like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCgQDjiotG0).\n\nAnd yet, with *that* said:\n\n&gt; To put it simply, other browsers has closed, if not overtaken the Chrome and everything it stood for.\n\nTo an extent, this is true. It certainly happened pretty quickly for JavaScript, for example -- everyone was using pretty naive JS *interpreters* back then, and Chrome was the first browser to do an actual JIT VM, compiling JS down to native code. It was like five to ten times faster than every other browser. Safari and IE closed that gap pretty quickly.\n\nBut I think this is most of what Chrome was meant for anyway. Why did Google make a browser? To push the Web forward. Sounds altruistic, but it's simpler than that -- they want things like Gmail to be fast. Most users used IE, and IE is slow, so Gmail was (relatively) slow for a lot of users.\n\nI think it's fair to say that Chrome fixed that problem. Chrome made JS fast enough in Chrome to embarrass all the other browsers into making their own JS engines fast. So now Gmail is fast, even in IE. Even if 90% of users were still stuck on IE, that would be a win.\n\nFrom that perspective, the fact that Chrome also has a lot of users is just a nice side effect. (And it's also insurance that Microsoft will never again do what they did with IE6.)\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the First Response's effective use of clear, structured arguments that directly address the Original Post's claims with factual information and historical context.

The GOP's stances on social issues are downright appalling to me. I know that people tend to surround themselves with like minded people, be it consciously or not, so the thought of the GOP being unable to ever win another presidential election has crawled into my head. ***(TL;DR in bold.)***\n\n***The social issues I'm talking about are:***\n\n* ***LGBT issues*** such as same sex marriage, religious freedom laws, \"bathroom bills\" involving trans people, etc.\n\n* Their black and white stance on ***abortion***- some of them want no exceptions for cases of terrible fetal deformities, threats to the life of the mother (Scott Walker in the last debate), rape, incest, etc.\n\n* Fighting against ***contraceptives*** and the morning after pill that could prevent unwanted pregnancies and prevent abortions\n\n* Pushing ***abstinence only sex ed.*** [37 states allow for medically inaccurate information to be taught to students as \"fact\", so long as it scares them out of having sex. My school was one of the ones that taught blatantly incorrect information.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/08/sex-education-requirement-maps_n_5111835.html)\n\n* Claiming that anthroprogenic ***climate change*** isn't real, and pushing the teaching of ***intelligent design*** in public schools\n\n* ***Marijuana legalization***\n\n* Being so ***bible/religion*** based when the population seems to be shifting away from religion\n\n***Please please please change my view! I live in Ohio, so I really can't let myself slide into apathy thinking that the GOP has no hope of winning anything! You don't need to change my views on the social issues at hand, just convince me that another Republican president isn't out of the question!***\n\nEdit 1: Wow! Lots of responses- awesome! It's going to take me a few minutes to sift through all this. :D\n\nEdit 2: Delta awarded- if a candidate like Hillary gets the democratic nomination and young people who are frustrated with government express that frustration by just staying home on election day, it will definitely give Republicans an advantage, no matter their stance on the issues.\n\nEdit 3: Please cite sources if possible. Feelings and anecdotes don't hold the same weight as things like polling data from reputable institutions, academic studies, etc.\n\nEdit 4: Another delta awarded- to /u/WhiskeyCoke77 for a good academic explanation of issue salience, how some voters find some issues more important than others.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We've seen *exactly* what happens when they think the Republican can't win: they get complacent and nominate a boring establishment candidate that fails to energize their flakier base, and they fuck it up.

The writer tries to create a sense of urgency and authority by throwing around statistics and historical references. However, the tone comes off as slightly chaotic and less polished, suggesting more passion than clarity.\n  \n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** The response uses pathos by referencing historical elections and popular figures like Obama, trying to appeal to the original poster's emotions regarding hope and change. The intent appears to be to invoke a sense of nostalgia and understanding of electoral dynamics.\n\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The response has numerous typos and grammatical errors, leading to a lower readability level. Run-on sentences and awkward phrasing detract from the overall impact and clarity of the argument.\n\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** While the responder does reference the original poster's locale (Ohio), the engagement feels somewhat lacking. There is no direct engagement with the original poster\u2019s concerns or circumstances, aside from throwing out statistics.\n\n**Second Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is more analytical and strategic. It maintains a certain level of respect towards the original poster\u2019s viewpoint while systematically dissecting the electoral landscape.\n\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** This response uses logos more effectively with clear rational arguments about voting trends, demographics, and party strategies. It references the need for voter excitement, which appears to align with the original poster's feelings of urgency about voter turnout.\n\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The second response is more coherent, with clearer sentences and logical flow making it easier to read and understand. The structure helps communicate the argument effectively.\n\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** This response directly addresses the feelings of complacency and disillusionment expressed by the original poster.

[This study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/abstract.aspx?ID=250684) shows that those children who were not spanked gained over 5 more points (on a 100-point scale) compared with those children who were spanked.\n\nThat's not all, of course. It's known that children who are spanked and harshly disciplined are more likely to show signs of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

{"index": 309, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I'm having a hard time time seeing a functional difference between trans-ethnic and trans-gender.\n\nOriginal Post: \nApologies in advance, as I'm sure this topic has been done to death in light of recent events. I read a few of the posts and they really didn't do anything to help my confusion. Viscerally, I feel like the two **are** different things and should be treated as such, but every argument I'm seeing seems to fall flat for me and I'm left with the default position: the two are functionally equivalent.\n\nThe primary argument I've read against my view is that there are biological differences between how men and women are wired mentally. However, most of the papers I've read on the matter are based on [population studies](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763413003011) that tease out group differences from large and varying datasets. Brains aren't monolithic things that are all one way or another - for that matter, new neuronal connections and pathways can be influenced by surroundings, behavior and a host of other factors. If [where you live can determine whether or not you develop schizophrenia](http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/795.full.pdf&amp;), then it's quite possible that growing up with black siblings can subtely affect the brain connections of a white girl from Montana. Stepping back though, why should empirically-observable differences 'legitimize' obvious differences in behavior? Our understanding of brain physiology is nowhere near precise enough to give us a 1:1 correlation between behaviors and biochemistry, and even if it were, it's not clear to me at all that someone's behavior should be invalidated because it doesn't map to our limited biological understanding.\n\nAnother argument I read differentiated gender as an individualistic identity and ethnicity as a group identity. I like the thought, but just like brains, black identity isn't a monolithic thing. For every Rachel Dolezal - there are likely thousands of non-black people living in predominantly black neighborhoods, developing identities not terribly different from the black people they most often interact with - your Eminems, to use a terrible example. Saying lack of pigment invalidates that identity seems functionally identical to saying lack of a particular sex-characteristic invalidates a gender identity.\n\nFeel free to point me to a discussion, if you don't want to rehash this. I'm pretty open to having my mind changed on this one, as my feelings seem to be in disagreement with my reasoning.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There's no inherent sense of racial identity wired into our brains like there is with gender identity because there is no biological reality that race is tied to. Gender identity is related to sex, which is a biological reality and shapes our brain chemistry, our hormones, etc. But race is an arbitrary social invention and has changed wildly over time and from culture to culture. With a few exceptions, race doesn't impact our biology. \n\nSecond Response: \nMy basic understanding is that a person like Caitlin Jenner is mentally ill, suffering from gender dysphoria. Hormone therapy, sex reassignment, etc. are all used as treatments for this disease. It's important to note that this is a medical condition that can be diagnosed and treated. For people with a less severe case of dysphoria, maybe counseling and cross-dressing is enough treatment, and they don't need the hormones and surgery. \n\nAFAIK Rachel Dolezal is not suffering from any mental illness. She took on a black identity as she felt  *sympatico* with black culture and experience. And in her chosen field of study being a black woman added an aura of authenticity to her art, writings, teaching and other work. \n\nThere may come a time when race dysphoria is as real and measurable as gender dysphoria, to the point of being accepted by the medical community as disorder deserving treatment. But that point has not been reached today. And I must continue to rely on the medical community to sort out who is ill and who isn't. Since the brain is so complex I must rely on the experts to *scientifically* determine which states or mind are genuine identity disorders, and which are simple mimicry. \n\n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses, the following stylistic elements are evident:\n\n### First Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The tone is assertive yet neutral, avoiding judgment. It presents an educational perspective, attempting to clarify the original poster's confusion.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques**: It uses contrast to differentiate gender identity from racial identity, emphasizing the arbitrary aspect of race compared to the biological basis of gender. The appeal to social constructs is a strong rhetorical technique that resonates with contemporary discourse on identity.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The response is straightforward and concise, focusing on clarity. It presents a clear separation of ideas that enhances comprehension.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The response directly addresses the original poster\u2019s confusion and seeks to clarify their misunderstanding by pointing out the biological realities.\n\n### Second Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach**: This tone is more clinical and somewhat less supportive. It implies that the situation is about identifying mental illness rather than a philosophical or social discussion about identity.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques**: The use of terms like \"mentally ill\" and \"dysphoria\" frames the discourse in a medical context. This can create a sense of alienation around the topic of gender identity rather than fostering understanding.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The sentences are often longer and include more complex medical reasoning, which may detract from readability for some audiences. The explanation is thorough but risks losing clarity due to excessive detail.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The engagement is more one-sided, focusing on explaining the respondent's view rather than actively engaging with the original poster's questions or confusion.\n\n### Prediction:\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n#### Key Factor(s) Leading to Prediction:\nThe first response successfully addresses the original poster's confusion about trans-gender and trans-ethnic identities while maintaining a respectful and educational tone. Its clear differentiation of race and gender as constructs engages with the original poster and provides a tangible basis for understanding the complexities of identity, which is likely to resonate more effectively with someone who is open to changing their mind. In contrast, the second response's clinical focus on mental illness could alienate the original poster and may not foster a constructive dialogue about their views.", "is_correct": true}

Also, aren't coping mechanisms generally considered a strength, rather than a weakness? With the afterlife, for instance, the fear of death might be a sign of human weakness, but the ability to surmount that fear is a sign of strength and resourcefulness, isn't it?\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;The theory isn't backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know, so the reason to believe in an afterlife isn't that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness. \n\nSo things that make life easier make you weaker?\n\nThat's incorrect. Humans have a limited attention span. Making things easier allows you to better focus on important tasks.\n\n&gt;The need for moral guidance in life - to need guidance from religion to know the difference between right and wrong is also a sign of weakness in that it shows a lack of judgement and wisdom for one to decide for themselves what is right or wrong.\n\nSo you're saying that learning how to behave from elders leads to you being weaker?\n\nThat's also incorrect, humans are much more effective with teaching and aid from adults.\n\n&gt;Furthermore, the need of a consequence by eternal damnation as persuasion not to do \"bad things\", and the need of an incentive by eternal salvation to do good. Is a sign of weakness in that it shows that human-nature is bad, or barbaric in a sense.\n\nSo here you're saying artificially produced reward and punishment schemes are unhelpful and demonstrate barbaric behaviour?\n\nAlso incorrect, humans are rational intelligent beings and it's fairly normal for them to create artificial incentive structures to aid proper behaviour, like golden stars for doing well at class, or setting artificial goals like having a bookshelf of a favorite author.\n\nNone of your stated weaknesses are actual weaknesses. There are religious groups with genuine weaknesses like jehovah's witnesses who refuse to take blood transplants, or the Hindu practice of followers of the Vishnu Smriti burning widows, but vague non weaknesses don't mean much. If a weakness leads to physical harm then it's a bit more serious, but vague emotional ones mean little.\n\nThere are many practices of religious people that humans in general do. Religious people speak. This isn't a sign of their weakness at nonverbal communication. Religious people exercise. This isn't a sign they are wasting calories. Religious people read. This isn't a sign of their lack of sociability. These are all common human traits that aren't weaknesses.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are the tone and emotional approach, as well as the engagement with the original poster.

{"index": 311, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: What we most hate in others are traits we have, and hate, in ourselves\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis is a view I've read about from various pop psychology sources, and it has become conventional wisdom. I believe it contains some truth. Can you convince me it merely reflects the fact that every person has pretty much every trait in them in some form, so if someone says \"I hate X\" they're bound to have some of X in their personality.\n\nAn important distinction: I'm talking about \"hate\" that people regularly bring up, like a person who's known for having a hate or dislike of something in particular (something non-trivial, not broccoli or crap movies): **Things that people hate which they think about regularly.**\n\nWhen people say they hate homosexuals, odds are pretty high they have closeted homosexual desires. This has become a running joke among gay acceptance (i.e. decent) people.\n\nWhen people say they hate intolerance, you'll often find they're very intolerant of views that strike them as incorrect or un-PC.\n\nNow, take something horrendously evil like pederasty/paedophilia. One of the most heinous, evil, horrible acts possible. Most people I know, however, when asked what they hate in people, don't really mention acts like that. They mention less horrifically evil things: I hate bullies, I hate hypocrisy, I hate rudeness. \n\nWe may want to kill a convicted paedophile with our bare hands, but during our day to day lives we don't think about them often or say we \"hate\" them--we save our long-term hatreds for less evil things. (This may simply be because (say) pedos are so rare and don't show up in our lives very often, or, because people don't hate that which isn't in their own psychological repertoire, or a mixture of both.)\n\nWhen I say \"I hate religious extremists\", I don't have to be religious to say it, but the underlying trait I hate may be closed-mindedness, which I may hate in myself and which I am afraid of exhibiting. I am 100% convinced I do not have a closed mind, but I cannot easily prove it. Do diehard atheists disprove the idea that what we hate most we hate in ourselves? I also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.\n\nIs it all just pop psych bs? I would like a good argument against the idea that our common/over-time objects of hate--particularly a character trait in other people--does not necessarily reflect a hatred of those traits in yourself and a fear that you will express them.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

People don't talk about how much they hate paedophilia because it rarely comes up in day-to-day life, and because pretty much everyone hates it. If someone asks you what the worst qualities in a potential date are, you're not gonna say \"paedophilia\" because that kind of goes without saying. There's no reason to mention it. When someone complains about that arsehole Mike scratching their car, it's because they work with Mike every day and he consistently annoys them, not because they are a secret car-scratcher. \n\nIt's true for certain things like homosexuality. I'm not a psychologist, but at a guess I'd say that's because homosexuality doesn't really affect you unless you're gay or someone you know is, so there's little reason to get angry about it otherwise. Again, that's just a guess.\n\nA couple of examples do not prove a rule. You'd probably hate paedophiles a lot more if someone molested your kid. This does not mean you are also a paedophile.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou're already doing a lot of projecting. You're almost cold reading yourself. \n\nFor all your examples you listed a reason that might have, have been the one because it matched your idea. \n\nDo you know your linkage is a correct one?\n\nI also hate animal cruelty, and I've never hurt an animal (knowingly) in my life and have absolutely zero secret or repressed desire to do so. But then again I don't really think about animal cruelty very often, but I do think about other things I hate: petty-mindedness, mean-spiritedness, etc.\n\nYou connect a person who is into animal cruelty to someone who thinks mean spirited from time to time.

The issue seems really complex to me, but at the moment that is what I think. Currently, the migrant crisis is one of the biggest items of concern for Europeans. Most Europeans say, with much accuracy, that the migrant stream has to be shut off because a) immigrants are a weight on the economy, and b) most migrants refuse to assimilate, creating a lot of social problems. However, I still feel like they have to own up to that problem. Western societies historically engaged in colonialism and imperialism and profited over it so much, that they achieved wealth that continues to earn their country the status of \"developed/first-world.\" Often times when they did this, they ended up creating conditions in the colonized country that would be unfavorable to their future development. I know most Europeans/Americans would respond to this by saying \"I had nothing to do with this, why should I take responsibility over the past?\" but I find that to be a really weak argument. If my grandfather robbed somebody of something, died, and passed the stolen goods/money down to me, don't I have a moral obligation to return the stolen items, even if I had nothing to do with the crime? I think I would. Maybe the main problem with my view is that it is purely moral, and not legal/practical. But letting poor people work out the problems that are partly as a result of your people's past seems very selfish to me. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The differences are too many to list, but the big ones are:\n\n#Cities have significantly better municipal services.\n\nThe difference is night and day. Cities have bigger and better libraries, schools, police/fire departments, hospitals, gas, internet, and so on and so forth. As 4G LTE rolls out, I can tell you exactly who's going to get it first. Everything about this makes city life so much safer and more comfortable.\n\n#Everything is closer in the city, and there is a greater range of things to do.\n\nA really small town will have one or two general-purpose shops. Cities can have huge malls filled with stores and restaurants of all varieties. There are theatres and large public events and strip clubs and meetings of like-minded people and clubs and just about anything to do if you ever get bored. There's a convenience store on just about every corner.\n\n#Cities afford a degree of pseudo-anonymity.\n\nIf you move into an apartment building, lolwhocares. If you move into the country you've got a ton of people who have a **new neighbor** that they wanna get to know and everything.

You're accustomed to having everything as fast as you want it. Country people aren't. They know and accept some things are going to be a hike.\n\nIt's also possible you don't really \"hear\" the noise around you all the time like someone who hasn't grown up with it or lived in it for many years, would.

Some people like having lots of animals. Some people like the lack of pseudo-anonymity and prefer to get to know their neighbors well.\n\nThere's really no way to convince you that country life is preferable, because it all comes down to what you personally prefer.

Why should I switch to something like Spotify when I already have an extensive library set up?\n\nOriginal Post: \nSome of my friends say Spotify is the best thing for playing music. But I find it hard to believe when there are people like me who already have over 1000 songs in our library. Not to mention, iTunes is the only thing that will properly communicate with my Apple product that I use for music.\n\nI realize you can download pretty much as much music as you want, but to get that, you have to pay. Whereas iTunes is free. I'm not really the type of person who's into discovering brand new music all the time. Occasionally, I'll expand my horizons until I find an artist who really sticks, and then I'll play the crap out of their music until I'm pretty much sick of it. Back in the day, when I had a Zune to play music, they had a similar feature where you could pay a fixed subscription fee to download as much music as you wanted for free. Even back then, an offer like this didn't pique my interest.\n\nKnowing this, are there any standout features that evolve the listening experience so much that I'd be willing to abandon my iTunes library and start over again?\n\nEdit: I've decided that I want to experiment with Spotify and at least try it out.

So thank you for the good conversation as well. \n\nFirst Response: \nAs a former iTunes user, I know how you're feeling - I had a library of thousands of songs that I no longer use. I think it all boils down to a cost-benefit analysis, and how quickly you like to add music to your library.\n\nUsing iTunes is free, but you have to pay about a dollar, give or take, for each song (less per song if you purchase an album). With Spotify Premium, you pay $5 per month for unlimited songs. So, if you regularly add more than five songs a month (which I do) then Spotify is definitely worth the fee. The crux of this issue is that it doesn't matter how many songs you *already have in your library*, but *how often you add new ones*.\n\nAlthough I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that Spotify has a free version (if you can stomach the drawbacks) which offers most of the same benefits. Theoretically unlimited music library for free - hard to beat that.\n\nSecond Response: \nCost analysis.\n\nLets say over the next 2-3 years you plan on buying 500 new songs. If you are buying them as singles, that could easily be $500 as ($1 a song).\n\nSpotify (free version) would already be an upside. Now lets say you want to play your music when you are not at home, and do not have your devices with you. You could use any computer and log on to your playlist and songs.\n\nThen conveniece, you are driving to work and you hear that dope ass song, it is new and you dont have it. you dont need to think about buying it, or if its worth it.

{"index": 315, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Prostitution should be legalized, I don't feel most arguments against it hold water.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've been thinking about this one for a while. While a lot of the arguments for it (\"It's the oldest profession\"; \"we should have full rights to our bodies\") don't hold up too well, neither do a lot of the arguments against it. **(As a side note, I'll be referring to women but all these arguments could reliably be applied to male prostitutes for the most part)**\n\nOne of the most oft-touted arguments that I seem to see is that \"Women will be forced into prostitution because they have no other options\".\n\nI fail to see this as a legitimate concern. Not because I don't think some women would choose prostitution to survive (it would happen, undoubtedly) but because I don't see how this is a bad thing. If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental *and* physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?\n\nIf I argued that minimum wage jobs should be illegalized because \"Desperate people might feel obligated to work them\", would that make sense? I don't think so. A McJob is a McJob, and a McBlowjob can still be a job without being intrinsically damaging to a person. One could argue that sex is still somewhat taboo, especially with strangers, and that the cultural ramifications cause shame, stress, and mental damage, but that's a part of society's problem with sex, not a problem with prostitution itself. The only argument I could think of is that a woman might be forced to give up her virginity to work, which I concede is awful and should never happen, but often does even with it illegal and if virginity and morality is the only thing standing between eating and starvation, I'm reasonably certain illegality is not going to stop many/any women.\n\nI think a regulated, safe, and well-operated system of brothels (and only brothels, to ensure there are no dangers to streetwalkers/regulations can be easily enforced) would reduce the amount of dangers as well as offer additional opportunities. To clarify, this system would involve:\n\n&gt;Similar regulations to the porn industry (mandatory screening for all workers, 100% condom use by 'johns', provided and required birth control, contracts either requiring abortion/absolving the secondary party of any/all liability and responsibility, physically and financially, in the unlikely event (but by law of large numbers unpreventable) double failure of condoms and birth control.\n\n&gt;Protection, both on and immediately off of brothel grounds, by well-maintained security forces.\n\n&gt;New legislation that ensures any fraud or intentional failure to pay (in the event some brothel didn't take money up front) constitutes rape.\n\n&gt;Harsh crackdowns and harsher penalties for pimping, street walkers, and other institutions (\"Massage parlors\"). Death penalties/life sentences (where it isn't already) for human trafficking and sexual slavery, all the way down the ladder, and rehabilitation for victims of this.\n\n(Actually, that last one would be good with or without legalized, but whatever).\n\n**What I'd like to see to Change My View (in addition to any logical moral/emotional arguments):**\n\n-Studies on legalization that prove it's not safe/causes societal repercussions more severe than the benefits.\n\n-Studies on lack of effects (or worsening) of street prostitutes/pimp culture.\n\n-Anything else relevant to disprove anything I've said here.\n\n**What I would not like to see:**\n\n-Outright moral arguments (\"Selling your body is wrong\", anonymous/casual sex is a sin)\n\n-Any arguments I listed above without additions (\"Women will be forced into sex slavery\")\n\n-Religious arguments\n\nThanks for your time :3\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This isn't true in most first world nations. The social safety net does a pretty good job keeping mouths fed. \n\nThere are exceptions to this of course, but most of them are solvable (husband drinks all the money away) or involve other illegal activity (drug addictions).\n\nSo, given that the social safety nets will keep people from starving, what's the difference between legal sex work and illegal sex work? If sex work is legalized, poor people will have to try sex work before welfare becomes available to them. **Poor people will be *expected* to try sex work before they are given relief.**  \n\n\"Can't get a normal job? Have you tried prostitution? No? Well, try that, and *then* the government will help you out.\"\n\n---\n\nSo, who cares? Well, you personally may not think that prostitution is immoral, but *billions* of other people do think that. Legalizing prostitution will mean saying to all those Catholic single mothers \"no, you can't have welfare support unless you're willing to sell your body.\" Does that sound acceptable to you?\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; If the woman's only option was prostitution, and you take that away, what is her option now? Starvation? Homelessness? While it might cause mental damage to a woman to be forced into sex, as long as it's legal, enforced, and safe, isn't the damage likely to be far less than the mental and physical damage she'd suffer being unemployed/watching her children and herself starve/living out on the streets/whatever else she needed the funds for?\n\nFirst of all, it's a false equivalency to say that people have a choice between either A) prostitution or B) starvation.   In most western countries, prositition is practically never the *only* option women with limited marketably skills/education have to make money, it just happens to be the most lucrative.  Waiting tables, cashiering, working retail, coupled with a relatively strong social safety net (like foodstamps, medicaid, rental credit/section 8 housing), is how the vast majority of the working poor survive.\n\nIt isn't just psychological and physical damage, there's some serious damage to both the immediate incentives and long term prosperity of people, particularly women, that go into prostitution, which are quite destructive.  Lets ignore the psychological damage/addiction cycles synonimous with prostitution and focus instead simple career growth, total earning potential, and the cycle of poverty.  A prostitute's peak earning potential is when they are the youngest and freshest (probably), and gradually dimishes from there.  Lets say a 20 year old can make 200-300 a night, 5 nights a week, that works out to about 50k-70k per year.  Very good income for someone of that age, certainly tough to walk away from considering the expected income of 20-30k, but nothing you can retire off of, and that's their peak income, and it will only go down from there. After 10 years, they're 30, maybe they're still pretty hot, but they can only get 150 a night.  so that means that after 10 years experience, the 45K.  5 years later, they're probably starting to show their age, lets say it drops down to 150.  39k.  Once they hit 40 they're most likely on their way down, if they stay in tip top shape, they could probably still get 100 a night. (even that's kind of generous).  \n\nAt what point does the person decide that the money isn't worth it anymore?  Is that point before or after when they feel like they're young enough where they can start their career in something else?  Does someone who go into prostitution hope to work in the same industry until retirement age?  \n\nWhile it's true that low wage work isn't great, it can lead to opportunities of advancement, promotions and pay raises.  There are virtually zero of these in prostitution.\n\nOn the flip side, legal prostitution means higher demand from consumers, leading more people to pay for it, and increasing hte number of people going into as a profession.   While the level of damage each individual would decrease, the number of total damage would increase.\n\nThe types of people that choose this type of work would be lower class people with little career perspectives that would make some money for a while, but over the long term, most would be screwing themselves over financially and careerwise in the long term.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Engagement with Original Poster**: The second response directly addresses specific points made by the original poster, maintaining a respectful and informative tone while countering their arguments.

It is a desirable trait and those who criticize it are just jelly.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWe sometimes hear thin, attractive women get offended because they have been \"thin shamed\" or \"skinny shamed\" by another woman.  I don't see how that is possible in American society, being a thin woman is a desirable quality. [*edit for clarification* - having an actual eating disorder is not desirable, but being thin *is* desirable]\n\nThis alleged shaming is typically expressed with language such as \"you need to eat something\" or \"do you even eat\" or \"you're so skinny\" or \"you need some meat on your bones\" or \"you need a hamburger\".  In all of those cases, the speaker is not criticizing the subject of the speech for being thin.  Rather, the speaker is deflecting and express displeasure about the excessive size of her own body relative to the size of the subject's body.  In other words, she *wishes* she was thin and she's just jelly.\n\nFirst Response: \nThere's nothing shameful about being fat (by American beauty standards), either, and yet fat shaming definitely exists. \n\nSure, it's often unhealthy, and some people don't like the look, but that doesn't mean there is any justification for \"shame\".\n\nSimilarly, there's nothing shameful about being homosexual or black, and yet they are regularly shamed. \n\nWhether being thin is shameful doesn't change in the slightest whether or not \"thin shaming\" exists. It definitely does. \n\nSecond Response: \nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder. Big butts are attractive to many men. So yes, skinny shamming is a thing.

Since you don't know how to draw that line, your proposed ban would be unenforceable. In addition, it would be illegal since the government has no business determining what people can and cannot say, short of explicit and serious incitement to criminal conduct.

If you were to say you're not allowed to criticize your opponent, then that would give the incumbent party a clear advantage, as no matter how poorly they govern or how harmful their policies, the opposition parties wouldn;t be allowed to criticize them or their policies.  Say they slashed education spending in half, laying off thousands of teachers and closing down hundreds of schools, causing overcrowding and poor performance.  Shouldn't the opposition be able to draw attention to that?  So, lets say you're allowed to criticize.  At what point does it become an \"attack\"?  Tone of speech and tone of voice are really intangible, judging attack from \"criticism\" is highly subjective, so you;d be leaving that line up to human judgement.

{"index": 318, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Children who do not get 1st-3rd place DO NOT deserve a trophy for simply participating\n\nOriginal Post: \nHello CMV,\n\nI am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying \"hey, even if you dont try you still win\". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. \nWe all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding \nfailure/losing, CMV......\n\nEdit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to \"why\" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! \n\nEdit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! \n\nEdit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that \"all-star\" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub. \n\nFirst Response: \n&gt; never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing.\n\nI find this *so* ironic.  You realize that 2nd place is nothing but the first loser, right?  And 3rd place?.... don't even get me started.\n\nSo why are you ok with the first and 2nd losers getting trophies (and, presumably, even accepted them yourself in your youth) but the 3rd loser, 4th loser, 5th loser, etc. get nothing?\n\nIn the words of Herm Edwards, you.play.to.win.the.game!  That means there are two categories:  The winner and the losers.  Either you support losers getting trophies or you don't; and if you support *some* losers getting trophies because they are \"better losers\" than other losers, then you're just hypocritical.\n\nSecond Response: \nSo first in that age range those trophies are more mementos and reminders, the only reason I know the years when I played soccer as a kid is those trophies. They're like a stuffed animal you buy at the zoo. That said I do agree we should recognize the winning teams so there is something to play for. I personally like the four trophy type method. There a small trophy for just playing, and then 3rd, 2nd, and 1st get better trophies that increase in awesomeness the higher you place. This way everyone gets a memento, but they still play hard to get the 'best' one they can. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include the tone and emotional approach of the responses.

Being a slave sucks bantha balls. \n\nAnakin was the only one who needed to be freed - Yes, but Shmi shouldn't have to be a slave forever because she's not important enough to the story. \n\nQui-Gon couldn't free all the slaves - Yes, but that doesn't mean he shouldn't free the ones he can. \n\nAnakin needed to sever his emotional connections - Yes, but it seems like he would be more attached to his mother if she was still a slave billions of miles away than if she was living somewhere safe and comfortable. \n\nThe Force wouldn't work on Watto - Toydarians are immune to mind tricks, not being hurled around the room with the Force like a ragdoll. \n\nEDIT: /u/Makes_Poor_Decisions changed my mind. Anakin would most likely not have become a Jedi if he could have lived with his mother and been free.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nFrom a moral/practical standpoint, of course Qui-Gon should have freed both Anakin and Schmi - but you have to remember that the world that Qui-Gon lives in is not a practical world. Everyone he meets has a fate and a purpose in the eyes of this weird puppet-master called \"The Force\".\n\nIn Schmi's case she was a test for Anakin. Anakin is always overly attached to Schmi (and all the motherly figures in his life, like Padme). Eventually Schmi's death starts his real descent into the dark side. Qui-Gon didn't know this specifically, but his prophetic powers probably gave him enough information to know that Anakin's ability to overcome his attachment to his mother was vital and figured that sooner was better than later. Remember, Qui-Gon always knew the prophecy about Anakin and probably came to Tatooine under some kind of instruction from the force. Even if Qui-Gon had known that Schmi's death would have made Anakin go apeshit he probably would not have wanted to bring her along anyway. We see Anakin's obsessive need to control the lives of those around him based on his actions surrounding his visions of Padme's death. If Schmi had been around, in Qui-Gon's eyes at least, she would be another distraction. In fact she would have been on Coruscant during both the Battle of Coruscant when thousands of burning capital ships rained down on the planet and during the execution of order 66. If she wasn't dead by that point, Palpatine would have made sure some accident happened given his designs on Anakin.\n\nSo, to summarize - from a simple moral standpoint of jedi good, slavery bad - sure, Qui-Gon might have felt compelled to go vigilante on Watto - it certainly would not have been out of character. However, Qui-Gon was much more concerned with saving the force itself through the vessel of Anakin, so he decided that out of the way on Tatooine would be the best place for Schmi. Bringing her to Coruscant would probably not have saved her life or Anakin's soul.\n\nSecond Response: \nIt's actually surprising that Qui-Gon ever tried to free Anakin's mother at all, that's more out of character than anything else. \n\nPart of the reason that the Jedi Council is wary of Anakin is the fact that he is as old as he is, and has such a familial attachment. Jedi are specifically not supposed to have families, to avoid clouding their judgement (Read: making them hard to indoctrinate). Qui-Gon is ultimately trying to make the Jedi order accept Anakin. Taking his mother with them would work against that goal, furthering Anakin's familial attachments. He tries, and ultimately fails, (though how much of that failure is his, and how much is Obi-Wan's, is up for debate) to separate him from his mother to make him a better Jedi by removing as much of his emotional attachments in order to make him into a more acceptable, emotionally neutral Jedi. Obviously, this ended up failing horrifically, but Qui-Gon had no way of knowing at the time. And admittedly, remember that it ends up being Obi-Wan, not Qui-Gon, that trains Anakin. We have know way of knowing how Qui-Gon had planned on training Anakin to remove his emotional attachments, because he dies and Obi-Wan has to take over to the best of his ability.\n\nRemoving Anakin from his mother is more closely in tune with his overall motives. If had rescued the mother, it almost certainly would have made it impossible for him to be a Jedi.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - The **First Response** adopts a contemplative and somewhat philosophical tone, acknowledging the moral implications of Qui-Gon's actions while exploring deeper narrative implications regarding fate and prophecy in the Star Wars universe.

{"index": 320, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:If we are opposed to the prison industrial-complex... then perhaps shaming, shunning, and exile should be considered as alternatives.\n\nOriginal Post: \nFirst of all, I am largely opposed to the prison-industrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary (re: the drug war and victimless crimes), and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed don't need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact, I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm \u2013 directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also, if the person has dependents, they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for.\n\nSubsequently, if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution, then I feel that some form of shaming, shunning, and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay.\n\nOne advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. It's not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrator's fate. Rather, the perpetrator, by agreeing to make public their offense, can still receive a certain degree of sympathy and forgiveness. And if they are shunned or exiled (for some indeterminate amount of time), then other members of the public can go along with that punishment to a degree they see fit.\n\nGranted, with shunning or exile the punishment would work much better with social cohesion, but if it were the accepted form of punishment then shunning or exile might be more readily accepted and enforced by the general population of an area. Admittedly, this is an aspect of society which would probably have to be reformed or evolve if a society chose to move away from incarceration, corporal punishment, and excessive fines. But if society is incapable of changing in this way... then I'm not sure society would be able to change in other ways which would make it sustainable and tolerable to live within.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It doesn't protect society, because you're just putting them somewhere. Dumping your problem onto another country is not a solution to the problem. It doesn't rehabilitate them at all if they're not getting any help. It doesn't sound particularly humane, and it doesn't help the people who are wrongly accused. \n\nPlus, I would definitely not trust the general public with dealing out punishments. The public will hurl abuse and hatred at anyone they decide is guilty, regardless of how much evidence there is for their guilt. Think of all the hate Oscar Pistorius got without the public even knowing if he was guilty. You're essentially leaving the news media in charge of the justice system. \n\nSecond Response: \nGoing to prison for year is horrible, but what's arguably worse is that you have no life when you leave prison. Your family might have shunned/disowned you, you will have lost contact with your friend and you don't have a job. It is very hard to get a new job, because of your status as a convict.\n\nThis is the reason why many ex-convicts fall back in to a live of crime. \n\nYour system skips the prison part, which is nice, but it might drop you in a place where you are unable to enjoy your life or contribute to society.\n\nIt would be better if after serving their prison sentences ex-convicts are accepted back into society, so they can rehabilitate.\n\nObviously the war on drugs is ridiculous and people shouldn't go to jail for victimless crimes. We should fix these problems instead of trying to find a workaround.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post, here are the comparisons based on the suggested elements:\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response:** The tone is more critical and harsh. It employs a confrontational style, emphasizing the flaws in the original poster\u2019s argument. The usage of phrases like \"dumping your problem\" conveys a sense of aggravation towards the idea proposed by the original poster.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is more empathetic and reflective. It acknowledges the issues surrounding incarceration but shifts the focus on the consequences of shunning and exile. This response seeks to connect with the original poster on the ground of immediate personal consequences, presenting a more human-centered viewpoint.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response:** It uses direct refutation, highlighting potential negative outcomes of the proposed alternatives and offering specific examples, like the public's reaction to Oscar Pistorius. This technique is aimed at discrediting the original proposed solutions.\n- **Second Response:** This response employs a more narrative approach by discussing the personal ramifications for ex-convicts and arguing for systemic changes rather than alternative punishments. It's focused on rehabilitation and societal reintegration, which may resonate more with individuals who consider social wellbeing.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response:** The sentences are generally straightforward and concise. However, the high-density information with critical remarks might make it somewhat less approachable for some readers.\n- **Second Response:** The sentences vary in structure, creating a better flow for readability. The response uses personal anecdotes and a storytelling style that engages the reader with the narrative of an ex-convict.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response:** Engages directly with the logic of the original poster's argument but does not seek a collaborative dialogue. The critical nature may lead to defensiveness rather than openness from the original poster.\n- **Second Response:** Engages with empathy and understanding of the implications of the original poster's suggestion. It proposes a collective and constructive approach to the issues rather than merely opposing them, which could encourage a dialogue.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Key Factors\nThe second response\u2019s empathetic tone and focus on rehabilitation create a more inviting atmosphere for dialogue. By discussing the real-life implications of shunning and articulating a shared goal of reform, it aligns more closely with the original poster\u2019s concern for societal harm. This approach is likely to resonate more deeply with the original poster, potentially shifting their view toward the importance of rehabilitation over punishment. In contrast, the first response\u2019s critical and confrontational tone may alienate the original poster, making it less effective in changing their viewpoint.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 321, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: As a Vietnamese, sometimes I wish the America won the Vietnam War\n\nOriginal Post: \nLook, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  \n  \nVietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  \n  \nI understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  \n  \n~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  \n  \nEdit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.\n\nFirst Response: \nI think there's a fundamental problem with your premise. If you look at HOW the war started, you will see more issues with US involvement. The US acted as an aggressor.\n\nThey transformed a struggle that was essentially anti-colonialist (which they should have supported, based on their propaganda about freedom and shit), into a war-of-the-worlds-anti-communist struggle. They supported a corrupt government in the South (just like in Korea before the war there), which had no legitimacy, no credit, and no real power. Why do you think the Viet Cong was so successful? Poor people hated that government. (Just like in Korea, by the way...)\n\nThey also lied about an incident to get involved in the actual war (Gulf of Tonkin), and then they proceeded to massacre between 2 to 4 million of your countryfellows, bombed Laos and Cambodia, and enabled the Khmer Rouge to commit their own atrocities.\n\nHad the US not interfered in the original struggle against the French, there would probably not have been Chinese/Russian involvement in the same extent. The Domino Theory was a paranoid delusion, and it caused immense suffering to your country.\n\nAs for which overlords are better? Look at Latin America, if you want to see what life under US influence is. (Well, was.) Look at Nicaragua, Columbia, El Salvador, Chile, etc... not nice places to live (and die, unless you like being thrown out of airplanes, or killed for demanding 10cent more for the hourly wage of banana pickers). The Commies were not much better, either (I grew up in Central Europe on the other side of the Iron Curtain), but they at least took some social issues seriously, and invested in education, healthcare and other stuff, which were somewhat beneficial, even if it was stupid at times, like pushing for heavy industry in agricultural countries. (Just look how Afghanistan looked like in the 70s...)\n\nThe US involvement was wrong both morally and legally. From there it makes no difference what the outcome would have been; but if you really want to think about it, you might want to look at South Korea on the bright side, or the Philippines, Latin America on the dark side. An almost fascist dictatorship slowly transforming into a (relative) democracy vs a banana republic plagued by corruption, coups and death squads.\n\nSecond Response: \nI have nothing but admiration for the Vietnamese people. Within a span of 30 years the French were expelled, the United States was stopped from partitioning or exerting control over the country, and shortly thereafter a Chinese invasion was repelled. The Vietnamese also deposed the Khmer Rogue in Cambodia, a regime responsible for massacring millions of people.\n\nUnderstandably, you look to countries that have done well out of being within the US sphere of influence, like South Korea. Remember though that the Rhee regime, which was supported by the US during the Korean war, was also responsible for massacring 100's of thousands of civilians. At the time, alignment with the great power that would exert the least influence over Vietnam (the Soviet Union) was likely the best option.\n\nYour people have a heroic history and you should be proud of it.\n\n\"\"The last time the Chinese came, they stayed a thousand years. The French are foreigners. They are weak. Colonialism is dying. The white man is finished in Asia. But if the Chinese stay now, they will never go. As for me, I prefer to sniff French shit for five years than to eat Chinese shit for the rest of my life.\" \u2014 Ho Chi Minh, 1946\n\nThe same thing would have happened if Vietnam was partitioned or fell within the US sphere of influence.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to the prediction of the second response successfully changing the original poster's view are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more respectful and admiring tone towards the Vietnamese people.

It recognizes their frustrations and offers a broader context rather than dismissing their concerns outright, as seen in the first response.\n\n3. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The use of quotations and references to historical figures like Ho Chi Minh serves to reinforce points about Vietnamese pride and the context of their struggles. This creates a compelling narrative that frames the discussion in a way that is likely to engage the original poster's emotional connection to their history.\n\n4. **Balanced Argumentation**: While the second response recognizes the violence associated with both U.S. and communist regimes, it emphasizes the sovereignty and agency of the Vietnamese people. It avoids the harsh accusatory tone of the first response, which might alienate the original poster rather than convince them.\n\nThese stylistic elements collectively suggest that the second response succeeded in reshaping the original poster's view by connecting with their identity and providing them with a more nuanced perspective on the historical context of Vietnam's struggles.", "is_correct": false}

Hell, until the 19th century the vast majority of the world's population worked in agriculture without any benefits from technology or hope for growth. \n\nAll of the things on your list are taken for granted today, but are completely unreachable for poorer and less privileged populations (= most people who have ever lived) throughout the world and History. \n\nAnd yet people still fall in love and get married.\n\nSo there must be something more to sex, love and marriage than what you used to think right? Otherwise underprivileged people getting married wouldn't make any sense.\n \n\nSecond Response: \nSo, I'm blatantly stealing a bunch of this from [this article](http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/) so if you want to see it written much better than I can, read that. But here is the thing: It isn't limited to women, and it's much more broad than you think. Humans are all creatures with skills and needs. In order to create bonds with other humans, you need a skill that fits with that human's needs.\n\nThis can be something as simple as a mutual need for companionship, or as complex as a company's desire to pay money for someone to do upkeep on their servers that run on a very specific set of software that you happen to know how to use.\n\nThe thing about women isn't that they all have this list of things to be attracted to. A woman being attracted to you is not (necessarily) about how much you earn or how handsome you are. It's about how interested you can make her with your unique attributes.\n\nAs an exercise: what makes you special? If I were a girl, interviewing you for the job of boyfriend, what would make you stand out, and what would you say makes you a better applicant?\n\nNow, a harder exercise: What do you do that shows that externally? It's a pretty good bet that most people can't read your mind, so if you want the world to know that (for instance) you're cool and confident, or that you are a world-class singer, or that you are exceptionally nice (not the general \"nice\" that means bland, but that you care about humanitarian causes and do something to fix them), then the onus is on you to show that outwardly.\n\nAs an anecdote, here are some things that I have done that have led to some form of romantic or sexual involvement:\n\n* Told jokes\n\n* Juggled\n\n* Played guitar (badly)\n\n* Taught someone how to play a non-\"conventional\" board game (Arkham Horror, in case you cared)\n\n* Had the confidence to ask if they would go out with me (this should really be near the top of the list), and then didn't freak out if the answer was no (I've actually experienced this: one girl accepted after I didn't make a big deal of a \"no\").\n\n* Recited the quadratic equation from memory.\n\nI'm sure I can think of others, but the point remains that all of that had not much to do with my ability to provide for them or how handsome I was (and I'm a fat nerd, so I'm not really traditionally good-looking). \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses, several stylistic elements emerge that distinguish them from one another, ultimately allowing us to predict which response may have successfully changed the original poster's view.\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** adopts a more reflective and factual tone, grounding its argument in historical context and broad societal observations.

Yes, customers know the health risks to smoking, and are able to make their own informed decisions, but the label nonetheless has a deterring quality that can drive away sales.\n\nThe same would likely go for any food product with such a label.

Thus, companies at risk of getting that label wouldn't want that drop in sales.\n\nRegardless of whether or not GMOs have significant harms - socio-politically, legally, or biologically - as long as there is significant public disapproval of them, companies would rather not be forced to bear a label that will deter sales. It's not a matter of whether or not they have \"something to hide\".\n\nSecond Response: \nSo what do you mean by safety?  To consume?  This is really easy to determine.

This analogy adds an emotional layer to the argument, making it more likely for the original poster to resonate with the point being made. \n\nFurthermore, the first response acknowledges the original poster's concern about corporate transparency and reinforces it with a well-articulated rationale as to why companies would resist labeling, thereby engaging with the original poster's viewpoint more effectively.

To convince me otherwise (and thus support Bernie), you'll need to show me I'm wrong about the following points, or that they don't matter:\n\n1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.\n\n2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed.

Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like \"I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican\"\n\n4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly.

This is something i asked myself too and Mr. Sanders has passed my test. Here Ill try and explain why.\n\n&gt;1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.\n\nThis is pretty subjective. How do you mean flustered? He speaks with his hands (he's from Brooklyn), his hair is messy, but please elaborate on why you feel this way because i disagree that he looks flustered or awkward. Hes actual a pretty good orator IMO.\n\n&gt;2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?\n\nAs a (I) senator, he doesn't have the \"party\" alliances a straightforward Dem or Rep would have because hes the *only* Ind in our federal legislative body. As Dem president, this would change as he'd have the entire Dem aisle. That, in conjunction with hes been in Senate and USHOR for 20+ years so he has friends and has worked on bills with other representatives. That, and as president, his negotiations would take on a whole new level of seriousness when dealing internationally. This is a sticky issue for any pres candidate as there's really no \"well ive done this so i can deal internationally\" for them to say (unless they're an former/incumbent POTUS). \n\n&gt;3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like \"I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican\"\n\nHow is that any different then other reps? John Beohner swore to block anything and everything that Obama would try and pass. Strictly from a \"I dont like you\" POV. This is bullshit and he needs to be removed for this  (and other things). Were working on that (I live in Ohio). But regardless, to him, seeing the bush tax cuts and how the republicans love the system that is keeping poor people poor (Trickle Down, cutting social security/ social services, NAFTA/ various other trade deals) its a alright question. \n\n&gt;4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak, but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin, Khamenei, etc.? \n\nThis wasn't **his** event. It was a rally on Social Security, medicare that he was invited to speak at. If you watch the video, you'll see a guy (not Bernie) at the podium talking to the BLM girls. *That* guy was the organizer and Bernie said to him to let them speak. Its not about being a pushover, Its about, if i stop them, i look bad, i if i let them speak, ill look better and considering how he himself was arrested for nonviolent civil disobedience, it would be a little hypocritical for him to stop them. A 20 year old B.S. would probably sympathize with these girls and a 73 year old B.S. is still a civil rights sympathizer. \n\n\n**edit Spelling, grammar\n\nEdit#2 Here he is on \"State of the Union\" speaking about [ISIS](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/video-audio/sanders-on-cnns-state-of-the-union) \n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;1) I've never seen him not looking generally flustered and awkward. Working on international issues requires developing personal relationships, thus being good at making friends. I don't think he is like that.\n\nDid you know that Jim Inhofe, the ultraconservative man who thinks that climate change is a hoax(also wrote a ton of books on this) regards Bernie, the man who was the #1 ranked Senator for fighting climate change by various organizations as his best friend in the Senate?\n\n&gt;2) It requires building alliance and persuading people. Bernie is an independent, does not have serious alliances or close friends in Congress despite being there for over two decades. He has not gotten any notable legislation passed. Would he really negotiate the best possible international treaties for the US?\n\nThis is dead wrong. As a House member, he got the most amendments passed as anyone in the Congress. In the Senate he worked with Congressman Ron Paul to audit the Fed. He got a 10 billion dollar provision to increase the number of people community health centers served by 10 million. He worked with John McCain recently to craft the new Veterans Affairs Budget which was one of the most significant pieces of bipartisan legislation negotiated in a dysfunctional Congress. If you look into his history, it's pretty obvious that he did way more than Hillary Clinton(or any other candidate) ever did. \n\n&gt;3) A President needs to be able to understand and navigate everyone's goals. Bernie doesn't seem to try to understand everyone's motivations but rather just gets angry at people who think differently from him. e.g. he says things like \"I'll never understand why some poor people vote republican\"\n\nOf course it doesn't make sense why poor people vote Republican. Every survey shows that people tend to lean towards more liberal positions. Can you tell me why poor people vote against their interests?\n\n&gt;4) Being a leader involves standing up to or effectively dealing with bullies and thinking quickly. He has very little track record of doing this. And when the BLM protesters took his mic at his own rally, he just passively let it happen, seemed a bit bewildered. It may have been a reasonable decision to let them speak, but he clearly wasn't in control of the situation. How could he stand up to Putin, Khamenei, etc.?\n\nI already pointed out how he dealt with John McCain and Ron Paul among others. I thought that his reaction to BLM was the best choice he could do at that time. If he took back the mic, he would've gotten tons of bad press for not allowing black people to speak. How does this have anything to do with Putin? When hypothetical President Sanders deals with Putin, he isn't going to do so on a stage with thousands of people in front of him.\n\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To predict which response may have successfully changed the original poster's view, we need to analyze the tone, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, readability, and engagement of each response.\n\n**First Response Analysis:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response uses a casual and conversational tone, addressing the original poster as \"buddy,\" which creates a friendly atmosphere.

{"index": 325, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Keynesian economics is a thin cover for class warfare\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis stemmed from a discussion I had on another sub about the Greek economic crisis, and what people are saying should have been done in terms of policy by the EU and the Greek government, which dovetails with what I heard should have been done by the US government in 2008-2010 in the worst part of the Great Recession.\n\nMy understanding of Keynesian theory as applied to this kind of economic situation is that it prescribes the government to spend money by using public debt, getting that money to the worker and the spending class. This money, once spent, will require producers to produce more, meaning they need to hire more people, which will give those people more money to spend, creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.\n\nOnce recession is over and growth is good, the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers, the saving class, and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.\n\nFrom that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what\u2019s absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.\n\nAt this point, I see five possibilities:\n\n1.\tKeynesian economics is pure class warfare. Keynes and his followers believe that the working class deserves more and the capitalist class deserves less, and developed a theory to fit that opinion. \n2.\tKeynesian economics is *co-opted* by people with an agenda of pure class warfare. It\u2019s perfectly valid under the theory to create the virtuous circle through government spending on Rolls-Royces and summer homes for the rich, and perfectly possible to pay down government debt by heavy taxes on working-class activities like buying groceries and holding personal debt. *How* we spend and tax isn\u2019t the issue, just that we do.\n3.\tI have an incomplete understanding of Keynesian theory. There can arise economic situations where alternative actions are recommended. For instance, once the economy is growing and the debt is paid, does Keynesianism say to reduce both taxes and spending so as to \u201cshake up the system\u201d and achieve new growth? Or any other situation where good economic policy is to increase inequality and use the natural human jealousy, envy, and fear to spur people to produce more?\n4.\tI have an inaccurate understanding of Keynesian theory in general. \n5. My understanding is accurate, but my logic is faulty.\n\nRight now my view is hovering between One and Two, but I\u2019d really like to understand this theory better.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

At it's best, the redistributionary policies of Keynesian economic simply prolong or lessen the magnitudes of these recessionary periods.\n\nTo clarify, I am no expert on economics, and I don't feel qualified to debate the utility or success of Keynesian economics. However, \"class warfare\" is a powerful term used to describe the inherent conflict between the capitalist class and the proletariat, and while Keynesian economic may attempt to relatively improve the conditions of the working class, it does not seek to end the capitalist-worker relationship or the private ownership of the means of production.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; From that, I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class, the spending class, and the generally poor; and/or against the capitalist, the saving class, and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged; the activities of the latter group are economically bad (albeit necessary) and should be discouraged, minimized to only what\u2019s absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.\n\nIt's a little more complicated than that. You are partly-correct, but missing some key information. Keynesian economics is highly focused on unemployment, and during a recession unemployment does hit the working class very severely. Due to job loss, demand for goods and services declines and the profits of the \"capitalist\" manufacturers decline as well. Fiscal policy treats both as *vital* - it really isn't the case that one is more important than the other. Those who say so are talking politics. In economics, both supply and demand are essential. And Keynesian economics addresses this very directly.\n\nI should add that every sensible economist would recommend a mix of Keynesian and monetarist policies. The battle b/w them is politics.

A completely homogeneous environment is unlikely to be as intellectually fulfilling as a diverse one. Universities have done an excellent job in creating an environment that has tons of racial, sexual, ethnic and religious diversity. However, it still lacks intellectual and political diversity. People with conservative or right-wing views are [woefully unrepresented](http://www.criticalreview.com/crf/pdfs/klein_stern.pdf) in academia, particularly in the social sciences. Not only does this make people with conservative political views feel unwelcome and unappreciated in the university environment, it threatens the perceived validity of the research done. [This is even recognized by some leftists themselves](https://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/2011/02/07/right-wing-study-of-inequality/). How are you supposed to have valid research, let alone critical thinking, when there is an absolute hegemony of leftist views, which no one dares challenge due to their overwhelmingly disproportionate power and influence on campus? Therefore, to make university a more diverse environment and encourage critical thinking, we should prioritize student and faculty applicants who are affiliated with right wing organizations, and ensure that peer review panels have at least one right wing professor on them CMV.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns?

This is a problem that won't be solved by affirmative action because there are other disincentives for right-leaning people to express their views anywhere.\n\n**Part 1: Politicism outside university**\n\nOur recent general election, and the surprise Conservative victory, lead to an outpouring of hatred and discrimination directed at the Prime Minister, MPs and voters who 'voted wrong'. Not even one day had passed before it descended into violence in the streets of the capital.\n\n[Example 1](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OUtumWXXlN0/VU-b1Pd8ICI/AAAAAAAAADc/_SinEkUpPLY/s640/Angry13.PNG)\n\n[Example 2](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CcgZj-SKCig/VU5x_eeDAFI/AAAAAAAAACk/JRhTfGmiu48/s320/Angry10.png)\n\n[Example 3](http://i.imgur.com/1CYtJ3n.png)\n\n[Example 4](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OipKo2yAUcw/VU6EreSNo0I/AAAAAAAAADI/sxio0Tq55T4/s640/Angry12.PNG) This one was directed at me.\n\n[Example 5](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ufhTVSEGa_4/VU43Z5Y03dI/AAAAAAAAABQ/eTXN2hevU80/s400/Angry%2B3.PNG)\n\n[Example 6](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ffUSKNIwM9s/VU4w48Pvq-I/AAAAAAAAABA/gFw81ZSIwiU/s400/Angry%2B2.PNG)\n\n[Example 7](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GF87c9Ui_UM/VU5HL7BienI/AAAAAAAAAB8/5EXMiIh5m5Q/s400/Angry%2B6.PNG)\n\nThere is a certain level of \"anti-right\" culture emerging in the West whereby the left believes that, because the right are so vile and evil, any level of silencing or hatred directed at the right is justified. Needless to say, the only place I really speak my mind on the subject of politics is anonymously online or with close family. A lot of other people have the same attitude. While I was initially hesitant to call this \"censorship\", based upon the left-wing concept of \"No Platform\" I do now genuinely believe this is censorship, in many cases deliberately done.\n\n**Part 2: The Student Union**\n\nIn the UK, students are theortetically represented by the Student Union. At the national level, it is called the NUS (although not all student unions are affiliated with the NUS). This organization is so left-wing that even Maoists would call them loons. \n\nThe NUS, not Universities themselves, [is the primary source of on-campus censorship in the UK.](http://www.spiked-online.com/free-speech-university-rankings/analysis#.VYd03PlVhBc) Pro-life groups are banned at 4 universities. Right-leaning newspaper \"The Sun\" is banned at 26 theoretically for having nude models on Page 3, yet effectively identical content is still available in other publications making the actual motive of censoring right-wing content completely transparent. \n\nThe NUS even supports Boycott, Diverstment and Sanctions for Israel. The level of intimidation this can cause for Israeli students attending university in the UK is obvious.\n\nAt the NUS Women's conference 2015, proposals were put forward to replace clapping with jazz hands because of concerns that clapping would cause anxiety attacks. Additionally, gay men were accused of appropriating black female culture and a proposal was put forward to ban crossdressing.\n\nBahar Mustafa, a \"Welfare and Diversity officer\" that works for a student union, has even gotten away with [banning white people from an anti-racism event.](http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/white-people-have-now-been-banned-from-an-anti-racism-event-at-a-british-university/)\n\nThe NUS uses it's power to censor it's political opponents, to intimidate right-leaning students and enforce it's narrative upon new students. It completely fails to represent students, yet at the national level there is no competitor to the NUS.\n\n**Part 3: Lecturers and other university incidents**\n\n[Read this blog post in its entirety.](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/05/if-youre-a-conservative-im-not-your-friend/)\n\nIf you were a conservative voter studying philosophy at Royal Holloway, there is massive incentive for you to hide your views because of the hateful political attitudes of one of the faculty. No doubt similar hateful attitudes are held silently by even more faculty. This isn't even a personal blog; it's an academic one.\n\nIt's so bad that I hide my political beliefs at my own university, and I would describe myself as a Centrist, not right-leaning.\n\nThere have been multiple incidents at British universities where Israeli students or speakers have faced intimidation. [Here's just one of them.](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford)\n\n**Part 4: Why affirmative action is insufficient**\n\nAffirmative action is supposed to be a last resort effort to increase inclusion after anti-discrimination measures have been tried. Unfortunately, there has been zero attempt to prevent political discrimination at university. If anything, it seems actively encouraged. Until that encouragement is ended and regular support avenues for non-left students are set up affirmative action will do nothing.\n\nMy personal recommendations for the UK:\n\n* At a national level, set up a competitor to the NUS. There are a handful of student unions that have chosen to separate from the NUS due to it's radicalism that could work together to form this. It would be politically neutral.\n\n* Prevent the NUS from enforcing censorship policies.\n\n* Fire faculty and reprimand students who partake in or encourage discrimination towards anyone who is right-leaning.\n\n* Crackdown on the currently legitimized and even supported Anti-Semetic and Anti-Israeli policies enacted at universities.\n\n* Create a system by which students can report politicism, preferably at a level above universities instead of at the university itself because of the likelihood that such a system would be co-opted to deny right-leaning students access to it.\n\n* Ensure that progenitors of Conservative ideology, such as Edmund Burke, are studied alongside the progenitors of Socialist ideology where relevant even prior to University level.\n\n* Remove communist agitprop (such as \"An Inspector Calls\") from the English Literature GCSE.\n\nIf, after enacting all these policies and waiting 20 years, there is still a severe leftist slant in UK academia, then Affirmative Action would be worth considering as a last resort.\n\nSecond Response: \nIt's not just the Social Sciences that are dominated by the Left. The majority of *all* sciences skew towards the left rather than the right. \n\nI mean, the decision to be an academic has many qualities that appeal more to a Liberal than a Conservative.\n\n1. For example, why would a highly educated and talented scientist rather work as a researcher post-doc with dismal pay, rather than find a high-paying industry job? Because he is less motivated by the size of the salary but more-so by the perceived value of the work he does. Certain kinds of people would rather do poorly paid University Research. Republicans are obsessed with minimizing taxes to maximize your personal income. Is it surprising that Republicans elect to take a higher paying industry job rather than stay in lower-paying academia? \n\n\n2. Moreover, graduate schools are dominated by foreign-born students coming to America as a pathway to citizenship. At my state university, the vast majority of grad-students were foreigners, and the faculty was too. Is it particularly surprising that a multicultural faculty is hostile towards US White Conservatism? Perhaps then the very reason why Academia is Left-dominated is precisely because of *diversity*. Of course professors will be angry at pro-white, anti-multiculturalist rants, when their demographics are much more multicultural than the larger US population!\n\nAs far as you know, most faculties may already have ideologically-based affirmative action programs in place. American universities are obviously not structurally homogeneous. Unfortunately, the talent pool of willing applicants may be so small that finding a qualified Conservative is nearly impossible. Just look at the stereotype of a Liberal arts graduate student! Do you really suppose a mainstream Conservative man will spend 5 years of his life on a PhD history thesis without salary? Will the typical Conservative stereotype elect to study the social sciences?\n\n\nFinally, let's not forget the irony that affirmative-action-for-Republicans would fly against the face of Republican politics and ideology. Universities hire academics that can produce lots and lots of viable papers. Publish or perish. Moreover, Universities such as Harvard are private institutions that \"ought to\" do whatever the fuck they want. According to Republican political positions, ideologically-based affirmative action ought not be allowed. Positions should be given solely on merit - or in the Academic's case - their ability to generate vast amounts of research papers and bring prestige to the University. Conservatives should not be allowed into academia for the exact reason why Blacks or Latinos or other affirmative action'ed classes should not be allowed in - because they simply could not compete and do not have the necessary merit to be chosen.\n\nConservative professors should not be coddled by affirmative action, or they shall grow lazy and incompetent! \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To analyze the effectiveness of the two responses and predict which one successfully changed the original poster's view, we must explore their stylistic elements.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response**: The tone is critical and serious, focusing on personal experience and the perceived injustices faced by right-wing individuals in academic settings. The emotional appeal is strong, highlighting feelings of intimidation and censorship, creating a sense of empathy and urgency regarding political discrimination. \n- **Second Response**: The tone is more analytical and somewhat dismissive of the original post's premise. It takes a stance that combines sarcasm and a critique of conservative motivations for choosing academic careers versus industry work. This minimizes personal connection and emotional engagement with the original poster.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response**: Utilizes anecdotes and personal experiences to illustrate points, making it relatable to others who may have experienced similar issues. It cites specific organizational failures and presents a list of recommendations, establishing a constructive tone.\n- **Second Response**: Employs stereotypes and generalizations to argue against the necessity of affirmative action for conservatives, blending reasoning with irony. The response assumes a more contentious stance, which can alienate the original poster rather than engage them in a dialogue.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response**: While lengthy, the structure is organized into clear parts, making it easy to follow. The use of headings and bullet points helps with readability, presenting a logical progression of ideas.\n- **Second Response**: While it also flows decently, the reasoning can be disjointed and lacks the clear structure of the first response. Some ideas lack depth and may come across as convoluted, making it less engaging for a reader looking for a nuanced discussion.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response**: Directly addresses the concerns of the original post and expands upon them, offering insight and suggestions that resonate with the values expressed by the original poster.

{"index": 327, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: B. Sanders-style Socialism will dig our country deeper into debt by spending money we don't have, and despite great social policy, his economic policy is a deal-breaker.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI was raised by decently liberal Republican parents, and always felt that reducing unnecessary spending is the best way to counter our national debt (my favorite analogy is that our debt is like a room full of shit: if it's up to your neck, you don't raise the ceiling, you slow the rate of filling to actually deal with the problem). Socialism was always something my parents believed was for excessively liberal areas, like Canada and Cali; though they were very forward-thinking regarding social issues, such as homosexuality, recreational drug use, and foreign disputes. I love Sanders' social policy, but I can't see his economics winning many republicans or libertarians over. CMV?\n\nFirst Response: \nWhat spending do you feel is unnecessary? \n\nHere is a pie chart of all discresionary spending (2009 data):\n\nhttp://dissidentvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/3-Discretionary-Budget-2009.jpg\n\nHere is all spending (2012):\n\nhttp://climbingthefinancialmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Federal-Spending-2012.png\n\nSo where are you cutting? \n\nWelfare and entitlement is a popular place. However, keep in mind that for every welfare dollar spent, the government collects somewhere over $0.60 in tax revenue. People who get welfare spend the money immediately in the economy, and that generates a lot of economic activity. So it's very difficult to actually close a budget by cutting safety-net programs.\n\nNext up is Social Security and Medicare. These programs are funded through FICA taxes. They would both be fine if for some reason we didn't exempt all income over $118,500 from FICA taxes. Even with no changes, Social Security could continue to pay out 75% of current benefits forever. Meanwhile, CMS and medicare does all the actual hard work in health care. They establish the billing codes, decides what is reimbursed at what rate, etc. All the private insurers basically say \"we pay what medicare pays\" for everything. They do this while running a 3% overhead. For the purpose of comparison, private health insurers run 20-25% overhead. Any shift of healthcare from CMS to the private industry would me a massive loss of efficiency. Again, you can but things, but that doesn't mean you actually help yourself out in the long run.\n\nYou can rail against the US Dept of Education or the EPA, but the reality is that completely eliminating these programs are 1. not going to close the budget deficit, and 2. incur substantial societal costs.\n\nConservatives seem to see taxation and spending as inherently bad the for economy. This is simply not accurate. Money gathered by the government is injected right back into the economy. Money \"wasted\" on bureaucrats is money that is paid, as a salary, to consumers who then go out and use it to buy goods and services. This is why European countries are able to sustain tax rates that are significantly higher than the US and still have strong economic growth. Taxes are not bad as long as long as they are spent back into the economy. Here is a graph of GPD per capita:\n\nhttp://www.economicshelp.org/wp-content/uploads/blog-uploads/2012/11/real-gdp-per-capita.png\n\nAs you can see, there is not a huge difference in economic growth rate between the US and Europe, despite the differences in taxation and spending policies.\n\nIn regards to the defecit, debt for governments is different than consumer debt. The first major difference is the interest rate. The US government is currently paying 2.13% interest on 10 year loans. That's basically equal to expected inflation over that period; in other words the US is borrowing money for free right now. Because it is seen as a 100% safe place to stash money, people are willing to give it to us to hold onto for a while. It is also denominated in US dollars. Conveniently, the US government is responsible for printing US dollars. It could literally print the money to pay off it's debts at any time. Printing money causes inflation, so the US government doesn't do this, but it could. The only way we could possibly default on our debt is through deliberate political action on the part of our government. It's like Debt is a room full of shit, except you make the shit, and you decide how much gets shoveled out every day. You have to control the level of the debt, but as long as you keep it stable over the long run it's not a terrible thing. In fact, when Clinton was president there was a lot of concern that the US government was going to pay off it's debts and there would be no more T-Bills. This caused a lot of anxiety among investors as they depend on treasuries to balance their risk.\n\nSecond Response: \n\"Unnecessary\" when it comes to the actions of the government (without specifying a goal) is a weasel word since we could technically just have no government and live in anarchy. The real question with any government spending should be (imo) whether it's likely to either provide a return on investment or improve people's lives to the point that they wouldn't mind spending that money on it. A lot of \"socialist\" policies would have a tremendous return on investment: they could allow more people to be educated in the tech industry, they could get poor people on their feet enough to work, they could improve our infrastructure (which is typically given a \"D\" grade by international standards), they could improve our practices environmentally, etc.\n\nNot to mention: Sanders' policy could only be said to be the reason the debt is so bad if our alternative to him would have done better. Last time we elected a president against these kinds of social programs (Bush), he started two wars and ran the debt up ludicrous amounts. Given that all the Republicans so far sound fairly hawkish, we don't really know they'll keep the debt down.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Engagement and Probing Questions**: The first response invites the original poster to engage in a discussion by asking them directly about what they consider \"unnecessary\" spending. This approach encourages a dialogue and allows the original poster to clarify their position, potentially leading them to reconsider their views.\n\n2. **Use of Data and Visual Aids**: The first response provides specific data and graphs to support its arguments, making the points more compelling and easier to visualize the contrasting viewpoints about government spending and debt.\n\n3. **Logical Structuring**: The first response systematically addresses the original poster's concerns about various kinds of government spending and debt, explaining how some perceived \"waste\" actually contributes positively to the economy. This logical progression helps to deconstruct the original poster\u2019s ideas in a clear and understandable manner.\n\n4. **Real-World Comparisons**: By referencing European countries and their economic performance relative to higher tax rates, the first response presents a more holistic view that might challenge the original poster's assumptions.\n\nIn contrast, the second response\u2019s heavy reliance on philosophical arguments about government purpose and morality lacks the same degree of direct engagement and data support.

{"index": 328, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Everyone else should just let White Males have reddit\n\nOriginal Post: \nWith all that is going on with Reddit lately I think the big thing that is being ignored is that this is largely a White male community. When it functioned in that way everything seemed to go more or less fine (of course there were others interspersed but that was the majority of viewpoints). As more and more groups began to be introduced there were shall we say competing interests. They correctly are asking for space within the community as well. However, the problem is White men had already kind of adopted this space as a place where they could discuss their problems without feeling guilty etc. For example, when people complain about false rape charges getting to the front page constantly or reverse discrimination cases etc etc. I think the SJW this and that we often see is just pushback from White Men feeling \"invaded\" for lack of a better word. I'm not saying this is right. I think this last ush of banning subs etc also has the same implications first FatPeopleHate is seen as appealing to women and feminists. Then Coontown seen as appealing to minorities. I think its reflective of White Men feeling like all other people get to have their spaces etc. but they never do. What I got from the threads is that people feel betrayed and I believe that feeling is genuine. \n\nSo here's the actual CMV. Why can't everyone just let White Guys have this one. Why can't we all just either accept that this is and will be a site that leans towards issues important to (straight) White Men and will be biased towards their opinions or leave and go to a different site. Its not like their aren't other hubs. And I'm not saying that there shouldn't be differences of opinion etc. (newsflash: not all White guys think the same). But just as anyone is welcome to watch Logo and comment on it etc no one would complain that the content is too gay or be upset if anti-gay things or things that appear to be anti-gay get the equivalent of downvoted (and no I'm not comparing experiences in any way). I also think that if people recognized this gping in there would be less abrasive push back from the trolls and \"dark side\" of reddit.\n\n\nEdit: reply from /r/nannyhap produced new idea that perhaps having a place that tolerates hateful views makes for an artificial influx of them.

Homophobia, transphobia, fat-shaming, racism, sexism, blah-dee-blah, are all abusive behaviors.\n\nLike, I see what you're saying, I really do, but the existence of the current troll culture (or \"dark side: of Reddit) stems out of the fact that Reddit and similar outlets have traditionally been echo chambers for harmful opinions. They didn't start out as being \"white male\" opinions, but many young white men have adopted them because they've found a community that encourages that sort of behavior, and things just get worse from there.\n\nWhen it comes to spaces, here's the cold, hard facts: if there are spaces where it is actually unsafe to be white and male (and straight), they are few and far between. White males are typically attacked not for whiteness or maleness (or straightness), but for harmful opinions about other communities, which are not fundamental to their straightness/whiteness/maleness.\n\nSo the number of spaces for straight white males has not decreased significantly. The number of spaces for people of any sex/race/gender/orientation to act like total dillholes and abuse other groups of people has decreased, and if you're associating those opinions with whiteness and maleness, I have to fundamentally disagree.\n\nSecond Response: \nWait, I'm a white guy. What about being white makes me okay with racism, sexism, harassment, and just general diversity of opinions? The idea that SJW's are taking over reddit is just people freaking out over a bogeyman.

{"index": 329, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: X is better than Y\n\nOriginal Post: \nClearly, X is better than Y, for a number of reasons. \n\n1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to \"why.\"\n\n2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in \"ly\" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.\n\n3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. \n\n4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). \n\n5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. \n\n6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. \n\n7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. \n\n8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even \"American History X.\"\n\n9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, \n\n10. = X. \n\n11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. \n\n12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say \"X is better than Y,\" never \"Y is better than X\". \n\n\nEDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

X has a harsher pronunciation, a quality not usually considered good. Consider languages that have harsher tones, such as German and Russian. Conversely, languages with the more fluid tones that Y has, such as French and Italian, are considered more beautiful.  \n\n2, Utility. The purpose of language, and its constituent letters, is to be used and to be useful. A letter that can be used more often is better than a letter that cannot. Y is used in adverbs. It enables us to act with nuance. X is typically used to describe things that used to be (ex-girlfriend, for example), and keeps us locked in the past.  \n\n3, Flexibility. While X must always be a consonant, Y is able to flexibly switch between vowel and consonant. Indeed, it is the only letter able to do so. This unique power really grants Y super-letter status. Perhaps it has other powers, such as flight, and shooting lasers out of its top two prongs.  \n\n4, Scrabble. Here's the thing about Y: it's a get out of jail free card. Let's say you're stuck and you just can't think of a word with the letters you have. Instead of skipping a turn or taking whatever punishment scrabble has, if you have a Y, you can just pop that onto the end of so many other words. Sexy, smokey, many. The list goes on. You can't quite do that as well with X. Sexx? Smokex? Manx? Well, I guess Manx works. But still. Y is better at the job.  \n\n5, X in Algebra. X is the first letter learned in algebra, sure. But this is because X is mysterious and untrustworthy. Some days, X is 5. Other days, X is 10. Who are you, X?! And who are the members of your Axis of Evil?!  \n\n6, Pleasing appearance. This is one of taste, so I don't think I can change your view on this. However, perhaps you would accept a different viewpoint. The Y displays the pleasing triangle shape that women like to see in fit men. Y has a strong chest and a thin waist. Presumably, under a magnifying glass, we would be able to see Y's six-pack abs.  \n\n7, All sex requires X. But not all sex is sexy sex.  \n\n8, X typically highlights the more violent aspects of our history. Malcolm X, and American History X. X is mired in racism. Y is typically present in the more fun parts of our culture and society. Yoyo Ma. Yogi Bear. Yosemite Sam.  \n\n9, You can use Y on its own in a text for a word. \"y u do dis\", as an example. You can't say \"x u do dis\". That makes no sense. X makes no sense. \n\n10,  :Y\n\n11, First of all, that's not true. Plenty of people die in Texas. Not only that, Texas executes more mentally challenged people than all other Y states combined. However, we should note that Texas's barbarism puts it in good company among other countries and cities with X in them. They are typically in developing world dictatorships like China (Xian, Xiamen, Xinjiang) or in crime-ridden Brazil (Xanxere, Xapuri, Xinguara). Honorable mentions: Xaxaba, Botswana.  \n\n12, While it is convention to say X and Y and not Y and X, that doesn't tell us which one is better, merely which one is first. Sometimes, the former is better, like Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. But sometimes the latter is better, such as Tom and Jerry. We have to decide on a case by case basis. I'm pretty sure that in this case, Y is better than X.  \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nIn your arguments you make a lot of assumptions about what better means. For instance you presume that rarity is 'better' than versatility.  The letter Y is far more versatile than the letter X, it can be used in many more words and is flexible enough to stand in for vowels when using them makes a word look horrible.  On that basis the letter Y also has great aesthetic appeal.\n\nYou assume that consistency is better when versatility could just as easily be argued to be better.\n\nYou assume that having the word ex in sex is good, but in order to describe the magnitude of sex something exudes you need to add the y on the end (sexy).\n\nNumber 11 is just plan false as I'm sure many people die each year in Texas, and New Mexico.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are:\n\n1. **Direct Engagement with Assumptions**: The second response effectively calls out the original poster\u2019s assumptions about what constitutes \"better,\" framing the argument in terms of versatility versus rarity and consistency. This not only critiques the original points but also challenges the foundational ideas, which may resonate more with the original poster\u2019s thinking.\n\n2. **Structured Argumentation**: The second response makes a clear, concise case against the original claims. By systematically addressing each argument and providing counterpoints, it sets a logical framework that is readable and persuasive, allowing the original poster to rethink their position.\n\n3. **Conciseness and Focus**: The second response is more straightforward and easier to digest compared to the complex, humor-infused nature of the first response. This simplicity can lead to a stronger impact in a debate where clarity is crucial for changing someone\u2019s mind.\n\n4. **Clarification of Misconceptions**: The second response specifically corrects misinformation presented (like the number of deaths in Texas), which further demonstrates a depth of knowledge and promotes a factual basis for argumentation. This fact-checking aspect can foster credibility and strengthen its position.\n\nOverall, the second response\u2019s approach directly challenges the original poster's points while providing a more straightforward argumentative framework, making it more likely to effectively influence the original poster\u2019s view.", "is_correct": false}

It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.\n\nIt was to prevent a much, much greater loss of life had the mainland of Japan been invaded.  Estimates put it as high as 1 million casualties just on the US side.  It's conceivable that the Japanese would have lost 2-3 times as many.\n\nFor comparison, 246,000 were killed as a high-end estimate in the two bombings.\n\n&gt;A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.\n\nI think you have a basic misunderstanding of what nuclear weapons are used for.  At this point, since multiple nations have them, it's basically a fall back option when facing an existential conflict.  Their use in anything less than full-scale world war is basically impossible.\n\nNo other country has as much to lose as the US when it comes to stuff like that.  Our entire country depends on trade and relatively good relations with the rest of the goods-producing world.  Using nuclear weapons outside of that context would certainly be the end of the US.\n\n&gt;as the example of Irak has shown, can often not even explain why they went to war in the first place.\n\nCan you name another war we started where we don't know exactly why we went to war?\n\nSecond Response: \nWhat about a country like Syria or Iraq that used weapons of mass destruction **against its own citizens**?  The US used primitive nuclear weapons to end a war with fewer casualties on both sides after dropping millions of leaflets alerting the area of their intentions.  The US has been involved in several wars since then without using nukes.  \n\nThe US has a large military and stable government, and has the legitimacy as a state to secure its nuclear weapons.  I think a semi-failed state like Sudan, Nigeria, Tunisia, Uganda, etc would be much more dangerous to possess nuclear weapons because they much more easily could fall into the hands of terrorists.  \n\nFinally, the US faces no immediate threat, and is unlikely to have to threaten to use Nuclear weapons in the face of an immediate and existential invasion.  I think it is more dangerous for a country like Israel to possess nuclear weapons because they much more easily could be put in a point where they think they need to use them to defend against a conventional attack or face their destruction\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is somewhat analytical and defensive. It seeks to provide a rationale for the United States' past actions with atomic weapons and emphasizes historical context. The tone remains calm and factual, focusing on correcting perceived misunderstandings rather than attacking the original poster's viewpoint.\n   - **Second Response:** This response is more discursive and explores broader implications while making comparisons with other countries.

You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying that what you make will be enough to live off of, so it's probably just safer to get a real job.\n\nFor Youtube, it seems like you need to be the following to be successful:\n\n* A young attractive person (or at least a person with an attractive voice) that appeals to some major demographic (teenage girls, LGBT teens, sports fans, etc.)\n\n* Someone who was already famous on a different social medium\n\n* A Let's Player\n\nAnd in all of these, you need a certain budget to spend on making your videos (light, camera, a crew maybe?) and that's not including the money you need for specific videos (e.g. a Let's Player needs enough money to buy new/big budget games in order to attract attention, a make-up channel needs to buy TONS of products, clothing channels need to shop on a regular basis, etc.).\n\nTwitch has the same problems as a Youtube Let's Player; in order to be noticed, you need to buy really popular games and/or new games, and those are rarely cheap; most games are up in the $60+ range, not including DLC or even the equipment needed to stream at a constant frame-rate for long periods of time. \n\nEven if you DO get popular on either of these platforms and get a partnership, Twitch takes half of your subscription profits, leaving you mostly depending on possible donations, and Youtube takes a lot of your ad revenue (not including other Youtube-related partnerships you might have [cough cough Nintendo cough]). \n\nIf you ABSOLUTELY need to make money on one of these platforms, or a similar platform, then you should either be rich or have had a real job long enough that you have enough money to survive.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Not all nudity is the same.\n\n&gt;  I don't think it's too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk, or nursing at home, there are ways of handling these things.\n\nIt *is* too much to ask, and that's why these laws exist. Going to a bathroom is uncomfortable and unsanitary. Pumping milk doesn't get everything out, there are transportation (cooling) concerns, and some infants reject the bottle. You can't schedule nursing, so not allowing public breastfeeding relegates mothers to the home.\n\n&gt; No one else is obligated to accommodate public nudity. If it's not \"convenient\" for them, that's all part of the sacrifice of parenthood.\n\nEverybody is obligated to accommodate it because that's the law. If it's not \"convenient\" for you to not stare like a pervert, that's all part of living in a modern society where people accept reproduction.\n\nSecond Response: \nMany people here have noted that public decency laws often make an exception for nursing, I will try to address why these exceptions make sense to have.\n\nThe problem with nursing mothers seems to bee that onlookers might feel uncomfortable in seeing a normally sexualized body part. Since the breast of a nursing mother is shown in a clearly non-sexual context the discomfort at seeing it should be minimized already. On the other hand babies need food regularly, to limit where a parent can breastfeed is also to limit how much time they can spend in public. So from this I conclude that any law against public breastfeeding would harm parents far more than it would benefit onlookers.\n\nYou also mention accommodating public nudity, but we already accommodate otherwise unacceptable behaviors in the name of child rearing. We already accept that parents will take up extra space, will discipline their children, and have their children inconvenience others. Since children are integral to society and they are near impossible to bring up without disturbing others we make exceptions for them, letting their parents feed them everywhere would just be part of this tradition.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are primarily rooted in tone and engagement. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more empathetic and understanding tone, emphasizing the societal role of children and the needs of nursing mothers. It seeks to address the discomfort of onlookers by providing a rationale that frames breastfeeding in a non-sexualized, nurturing context. This emotional appeal may resonate more effectively with the original poster, who expresses concern for those uncomfortable with public nudity. In contrast, the first response takes a more confrontational approach, arguing that the laws exist solely to protect societal norms without acknowledging the perspective of the nursing mother.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs a series of logical arguments that build on the premises presented in the original post.

If a politician runs as a family values politician and is found to having an affair then it seems reasonable for people that want that type of politician to not support them and pressure them out of office. The political reality in the US is that most people have to run as being family values and an affair tarnishes that image. \n\nSecond Response: \nWith respect to the intern, now we're entering a work environment where people hold disproportionate bargaining power.  We're never quite sure how consensual it is, and with adults we let it slide a little more, but interns might create a heightened concern that the intern felt obligated to acquiesce to his or her boss, or put up with otherwise unwanted sexting.  There's pressure to say okay to those pictures because to speak up risks job opportunity and a future at the Capitol.\n\nAs for your councilman, I don't know enough about the details.  It might just be that your community values a certain kind of courtship.  One of the upsides to very local government is that you're beholden to community standards and therefore your work reflects what your neighbors want.  In this case, it can be one of the downsides.\n\nSimilarly, I don't know this councilman's platform.  If they commonly speak out against sexting, then it's hypocritical.  It's someone in power either lying about what they believe (that sexting is wrong) or genuinely thinking it's wrong *for everybody else* but them.\n\nFor many politicians, sex goes hand-in-hand with a moral platform they campaign on and often legislate.  If you're using morality as a means to get in and exercise state power, and then you act contrary to that position, people have every right to oust you:  anyone who sided with you knows you no longer represent them and everybody else knows you're word isn't any good.

Word comes from another Old French word then to a Latin word *mar\u012bt\u0101re*, which describes a husband and wife. Adding on top of that, many modern religions using the word to describe the ceremony as a marriage between one man and one woman, I see that the word Marriage is intrinsically religious. \n\nNow moving to modern day, Marriage is changing as many people are adding to/changing the meaning to a word that many people use as a religious word. People are getting up in arms about these and I can see their points. Marriage in a lot of religions these days is still defined as one man and one woman. Now have a court/government adding to/changing that definition of that word, this is where I believe the whole issue is. The issue with people not wanting gay marriage based off religious beliefs is because a word is being used for something that it does not mean to them. Marriage is/from religion and should keep it that way. We need to rename Marriage in the government to remove this part of the issue that the anti-gay marriage community has with it.  \n\nNow I know it still won't remove the whole problem that the anti-gay community has with gay marriage but I believe it will remove everyone who dislikes that this word, that is so entrenched in religion, is being redefined by a government decision. I even see a huge problem with these, I am not religious and completely for two consenting people getting married, no matter who/what they are. The government needs to change its vocabulary so that when you want your union to be legal, you go get a Civil Union(Or whatever we call it) from the government. But if you want to get married, you must find a religion that accepts your union. This returns marriage to Religion and I believe removes a huge part of the problems we are having in the acceptance of this practice.  \n\n[Source of Etymology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage#Etymology)\n\nHUGE EDIT: So /u/awa64 and /u/cptal has brought to my attention some information. The intrinsic nature of the word marriage that I was bringing up has some flaws. The act of marriage seems to have been more of a social thing rather than a religious thing off the bat. The church seemed to basically be the best at keeping records and the sacrament didn't come until later. So even though the nature of the word has been pretty much a religious definition for a while, the word itself is not intrinsically religious. [Here](http://www.sexarchive.info/ATLAS_EN/html/history_of_marriage_in_western.html) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1awx09/does_marriage_really_have_its_roots_in_religion/c91ik9s) are their sources they brought to me. \n\nSo with further communications with others, I have been bringing up that society is changing the word marriage and my view is more of a fix to speed up that change at least on the religious vs government front. The word will change in society but that takes a long time. As /u/GAB104 and a few others pointed out, that religion has change a bit from what it used to be. The whole owning your wife and stuff seems to come up a lot. So my view has changed a little but I still view that changing the government wording to something else would be a good thing to do as to remove the current problems that many religious people(That care about the issue) have with the definition of that word being changed.

The first response, while providing valid points, tends to affirm the original post\u2019s ideas rather than challenge them as stringently.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response engages more directly with the original post's arguments. It systematically dismantles the idea that marriage bears an intrinsic religious quality and counters the argument about redefining terms for the sake of religious comfort with examples of broader societal interpretations.

{"index": 336, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The Slut/Stud Inequality Is Generally Justified\n\nOriginal Post: \nOr more specifically, it is justified in general when a man gets praise for \u201csleeping around\", and it is also justified when the woman does not get the same level of praise for the same behaviour. \n\nI want to make this point clear \u2013 I am NOT debating whether or not it is good/bad when a woman engages in behavior that is typically defined under the scope of \"slut.\" That is another argument altogether. I am only asserting that the difference in reaction the majority of people have when they hear about the sexual exploits of either gender is, in general, justified.\n\nThe reason for this, of course, is biological. It is generally imperative for males to propagate their DNA throughout many different potential mates as possible, to ensure the survival of his line. Historically, however, females had to be more restrictive with who they engage in intercourse with, because they were then strapped with the burden of taking care of/raising a child as a product of the encounter. The brains, hormone profiles, and physiology are disparate between the genders to reflect, in part, these differences in motivation.\n\nGiven these differences, the crux of my argument boils down to this: it is simply more difficult for a heterosexual man to attain sex, than a woman, ceterus paribus. \n\nOnce again, to be very clear, I'm not making any moral claims about being a slut; I'm simply stating the difference in difficulty in accomplishing the same task, and the justification of the subsequent reaction.\n\nTo illustrate this point, I would like to I highlight the scenario of Bob. Bob built a business from the ground up; through sheer hard work and determination, he came from nothing, and now runs a company of hundreds of employees, making millions in revenue.\n\nNow, here is Patrick. Patrick also has a company of hundreds of employees, making million dollars in revenue, through his hard work and determination.\n\nThe difference between Bob and Patrick is this \u2013 Bob had absolutely zero dollars in his bank account when he started his business, while Patrick inherited over $5 billion from his father's trust fund.\n\nSo, even though both have technically accomplished the same thing, it would be fair to say that Bob deserves higher praise. The difference being, of course, while the task itself was the same, the difficulty level of either party to achieve/accomplish this task is significantly different. In the same way, we can assert that (all things being equal) it is much more difficult for a man to sleep with many women, than the reverse.\n\nNow, anticipating potential rebuttals, I would like to highlight other scenarios using the same logic above: I believe that heterosexual men (and homosexual women) deserve more praise than homosexual men for the same acts. To what degree, I'm honestly not sure, as I'm not an expert in biology/sociology of this kind, but using the biological argument for the difficulty of the task, I would say that homosexual men hooking up is generally easier than the other scenarios. I could be wrong on this, but it's more of an ancillary point rather than my main argument.\n\nTo make sure that you've been reading all the way down to the bottom, I would really appreciate it if you started your post with any word that rhymes with \"crime.\" \n\nThanks!!!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The reason that they end up being such \"studs\" is that they have some advantage that makes women more likely to want to sleep with them.  Leonardo DiCaprio pretty clearly doesn't put much effort into getting women, and yet he still leaves clubs with dozens of girls at a time.  Getting women is super easy for him, and yet people basically never seriously call guys like him a \"slut.\"  That's why that argument always seems like a rationalization to justify the speaker's feelings to me, instead of a true explanation of why they have them.\n\n(I read the whole thing but didn't have rhyme for crime that immediately jumped to mind that would make sense to start the paragraph with)\n\nSecond Response: \nCrime. You are correct in that it's harder for men to sleep with a bunch of women than a woman to sleep with a bunch of men.\n\nThe problem is you are attempting to shuffle off the \"Morality\" of women being promiscuous to another discussion, but at the same time you are saying that it's justified to call a woman a slut for doing it.\n\nIf you are going to say it's justified, we *have* to have that conversation as a part of this one. If the only reason we called women sluts was because it is easy for them to have lots of sex, then maybe we could ignore it, but you and I both know that isn't the reason.\n\nIt can't be justified to insult a woman for the same thing you praise a man for, unless you agree that women *should* be insulted for it.

The responder uses a dismissive attitude toward the original poster\u2018s argument, showing skepticism about their justification without being overtly aggressive. \n- The emotional approach is more analytical, urging the original poster to reconsider the broader implications of their reasoning.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**  \n- This response employs examples (e.g., Leonardo DiCaprio) that highlight the disparity between perceptions of men's and women's sexual behavior.\n- It uses a rhetorical question (\u201c...aren't you just rationalizing your feelings?\u201d), which compels the reader to think critically about the initial argument.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**  \n- The sentences are varied in length, but the structure is straightforward, making it easy to follow.\n- It focuses on clarity and directness, which aids in delivering the critique effectively.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**  \n- The responder acknowledges the original post by discussing its essence while clearly presenting an alternative perspective.\n- The response touches upon the core argument directly, which shows engagement.\n\n\n### Second Response\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**  \n- The tone is more assertive and somewhat combative; it frames the discussion around moral implications, attempting to shift the focus rather than addressing the original post linearly.\n- There is a hint of indignation, suggesting that the responder feels strongly about the injustices inherent in labeling.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**  \n- The use of \"if you are going to say it's justified...\" serves to challenge the poster, calling for a deeper discussion rather than merely picking apart the argument.\n- This response strategically combines moral and logical reasoning, ultimately forcing the original poster to reflect on their stance concerning morality.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**  \n- The sentences tend to be more complex and sometimes lengthy, which might require deeper processing from the reader.\n- This could lead to a bit of confusion for some readers, as the structure can make the argument feel more convoluted.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**  \n- The engagement feels a bit more adversarial; while it addresses the post\u2019s argument, it takes the tone of someone who believes a fundamental re-evaluation is necessary, potentially alienating the original poster.\n\n### Prediction\n\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Key Factor(s):\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the **moral framing and direct challenge** present in the second response.

The challenge posed encourages introspection about the ethical considerations surrounding the original poster's justification, potentially leading to a change in perspective.

I have torrented rarely for probably 5 years, but I would consider myself on the bottom end of piracy. I subscribe to Netflix, Amazon prime and Spotify, and usually buy my games on steam. Because of these services I never pirate music or games ever, and I usually do not pirate Television or Movies either.\n\nAs an aspiring filmmaker myself, it feels hypocritical to steal someone else's hard work, and so if at all possible I do not do that. I am more than willing to pay 3-5 dollars to rent a movie I want to watch. But this is not the internet we live in. While some movies are available on youtube, itunes and amazon instant for rental, many are either only available to buy or not available at all. On top of that, these services tend to have a charge to rent the \"HD\" version of the film, a practice I believe to be archaic and stupid in an age where everyone has HD monitors and/or TVs. \n\nIn my mind, if there were a service that made a huge selection of films available for a one-time viewing for $5 easily and at full quality -- with options for downloading if need be -- I personally would never pirate films or TV. \n\nHowever, this may not represent the consumer base as a whole and may not be enough to save the companies afraid of the internet. \n\n(WARNING: I AM GOING OFF WHAT I HAVE READ IN THIS SECTION -- I DO NOT HAVE SOURCES FOR MY CLAIMS YET) \n\nWhile Spotify does seem mitigate piracy, it also does not give much money to artists as a rule. But, at the same time, most artists make their money from touring and not from album sales, as the record label would end up taking most of the money from itunes/CD sales anyways. So part of me thinks that in this open age that perhaps it is the companies that should fail, if they cannot accept the internet's existence, freeing the artists to receive more money for sales directly from services such as Spotify and iTunes. The same applies to movies, television (which Netflix has helped a lot, I think) and games (I don't know many people who pirate games, since they are readily available on Steam and GOG.com as a rule) as well.\n\nTL;DR -- I think the companies fighting piracy should give up and try to mitigate it instead -- adapt rather than fight. \n\nWhat do you think?

And music excluded piracy is still too much of a hassle for the average person.     I teach elementary school and like my colleagues would find the process of ripping off tv shows and movies to be far more of a hassle than it's worth, especially in light of the time economy and average broadband speeds where you might have to wait a good bit before you can watch your show.   \n\nIt's a business decision to extract the most money out of a piece of media by subjecting it to windowing.   That is first get the money out of the people who will pay 11 dollars to watch it one time.  Then get the 20 dollars out of the people who will buy the blu-ray.    Then get money from HBO or similar, then eventually it ends up for rent on iTunes&amp; Amazon.   \n\nYes eventually we might end up at a place where a model like the one you suggest makes sense, but today is not that day.

{"index": 338, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: People who say victims of suicide are selfish are the ones who are actually selfish\n\nOriginal Post: \nMy logic is pretty simple. People who believe that someone is selfish for committing or wanting to commit suicide just because it makes those around them sad then they are actually the ones who are selfish because they'd rather someone suffer than have them end their misery and be forced to grieve their death. I think there are instances where suicide is selfish (people who have children that still rely on them) but if you have no responsibilities such as that then it could be your reasons are actually very selfless. Furthermore I think that calling people who struggle with suicidal thoughts \"selfish\" is extremely insensitive and misguided as I'd tend to believe that most people who off themselves are doing it for reasons they perceive to be for the greater good. CMV!\n\nFirst Response: \nI would say that both are correct. The person who commits suicide and the person who expects someone who wants to commit suicide not to do it are both thinking about themselves and their own values. More importantly, their actions are chosen.\n\nI personally think that everything people consciously choose to do is inherently selfish as they are carrying out their own whims, regardless of how their actions may or may not affect others. Because when it's all said and done even if what they did helped others and inconvenienced them it was still what they wanted to do so they were still just satisfying their own desires. And that to me is selfish, which consequently makes those who commit and those who oppose suicide selfish.\n\nSecond Response: \nSelfish means lacking in consideration of others. *The suicide person might not be thinking of others. The person whos calling the suicider selfish though is probably thinking of other people who will be harmed by this. \n\nNow if it was only a family of 2 though and 1 sister wanted to commit suicide I can see how both would be selfish but that usually isnt the case.\n\nSo, whether or not someone is selfish is really about whether or not their actions/advice only benefit themselves. *Suicide people might be only thinking about themselves and therefore might be selfish.\n\nEDIT: I realized while in discussion I cant assume the majority of suicide peoples motives.

One way is your way: they match shapes and colors on the pieces themselves and build the puzzle that way. The other way is my way: we use the patterns on the pieces to figure out where they go in the larger picture (using the box).\n\nI get a lot of enjoyment doing it my way. In any decent puzzle placing figuring out where individual pieces fit in the larger picture is challenging. You get a piece that has some brown but a little blue and a grainy texture and you have to figure out where in the picture you can find those three things. And the fact that good puzzle-makers design their cuts to break up recognizable features indicates to me that they don't consider this technique cheating. It's part of the fun!\n\nAlso, I always do puzzles in groups and these two strategies are complementary. My sister is very good at doing things your way and I am good at my way. She ends up doing a lot of work very quickly while I get to puzzle over the trickier pieces.\n\nDoing it my way you also get to know the picture well! This pleases me because I love looking at pictures.\n\nOf course, both ways have their weaknesses, and can be more or less effective depending on the puzzle. In fact, your way may actually be more effective in general, but it's definitely not the only way to enjoy a puzzle.\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI used to totally do puzzles your way, however I have since begun to switch back and forth between strategies for different puzzles. Switching back and forth has helped me become more efficient at doing puzzles overall. Try doing a puzzle without doing the edges first: that is true hard mode.\n\nAlso, pictures should be on the box either way because I don't want to work on a puzzle that doesn't come together to make a picture I like to look at.

The amount of people who make food choices and calculate animal suffering into the equation about what to buy is about 1-3 percent and has stayed that number for a long time. \n\nYou're making a moral argument where one really doesn't exist for the far, far majority of people. \n\nEven if you do, you being a vegan isn't going to change anything.

Stored food for the winter,  provided water and medical treatment, protection from predators.  And a swift death when the time comes. \n\nI work at a small dairy farm.  There are many farmers still out there that care for their animals.  It's consumers that have shifted the markets,  as consumers become more disconnected from their food they allow industrial farms to take over.

If you lock him up for 20 years, he'll get out when he's 37; for 30 and he'll be 47; for 40 and he'll be 57 years old. We're talking about a child's life here. Granted, what he did is undoubtedly wrong, and I cannot imagine being a victim, having a SWAT team in full gear and weaponry busting down your family's door has to be one of the scariest experiences I can think of. That said, this is still a 17 year old child. A moron really, if only by age. Can you imagine the person you were 10 years ago, and how different you were? Or the person you were in high school? This is just some idiot kid who thought he was pranking people. Put him away for 5 years, that's still a massive amount of time, but when he gets out you'll more than likely have someone who is truly sorry. If you don't let him out until he's in his 30's or 40's, you have effectively destroyed his entire life. He'll have never finished school, gotten any job experience, he's already got this criminal record, he'll be getting into his older years so finding companionship will be much more difficult... Sometimes I think we lock some people away for far too long and don't actually think about what it would have to be like sitting in a room for so many hundreds or thousands of days. \n\nSecond Response: \nI just finished a Law test which included sentencing, so I could shed some light on why it is a bad idea.\n\nI'm no expert on the crime specifically, but I'll start by discussing deterrence as a sentencing rationale. \n\nDeterrence, for anyone who can't figure it out, is punishing more than someone deserves as a means of scaring others into not committing the crime. It is a good method, as huge punishments for petty crime generally do deter people from committing it (to an extent). However it is extremely unjust to give huge punishments for petty crime, because (in reference to your suggestion) you are giving them a sentence length equivalent to violent crime and even murder. If you can achieve deterrence then it is obviously a positive, as less people are going to commit the crime. But there are many problems with it, which is why it is almost never used and when it is used, it gets a negative backlash (Look at the war on drugs, mandatory minimum sentences etc). \n\nIt assumes many things - that the criminal expects to get caught, that the authorities actually catch these people often. If the apprehension rate is low, which it is for this crime, then people aren't going to be scared of getting caught and the punishment won't matter. It also requires good publication of the sentences given, because if people don't know the punishment given out in practice then they won't care. It also arbitrarily punishes someone more than they deserve, which goes against many sentencing principles in western criminal justice systems. This is more for violent crime, but people usually weigh the severity of the crime over the length - so a harsher punishment will be better than a longer one. \n\nThe biggest factor is that they don't expect to get caught, which makes the punishment irrelevant. \n\nIndividual rights are hugely important here too. I'll discuss a few of the relevant criminal justice system principles which are consistent across western societies.\n\n* The principle of minimum criminal punishments. This ties in with the idea that penal punishments should be avoided if possible, because jail heavily restricts established individual liberties. Deterrence goes against this entirely, as you are extending the restrictions on ones liberties based off of actions that others could commit. You are essentially taking punishment for what others haven't even done yet, which is bad policy. \n\n* Proportionality - the punishment should fit the crime. Years of jail time are far more (Taking into account restriction of personal liberties) than this crime generally deserves. \n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that courts do take into account aggravating and mitigating factors on a case by case basis. If Swatting resulted in injury, an unusually large amount of resources being wasted or unusually large amounts of psychological damage then they would aggravate the sentence.\n\nIf there are many crimes being committed at once when swatting then it could make for a big punishment. This is why some IT crimes can amount to huge sentences in comparison to something which is seemingly worse, like murder. The IT crimes are usually many crimes being committed together, where as murder is the singular sentence. \n\n**tl;dr** - Deterrence doesn't really work. It relies on the fact that people expect to get caught, which they don't. It also violates many sentencing principles. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the emotional and empathetic tone of the First Response.

In the U.S. both are highly privatized. However I believe they should be free for several reasons:\n\n- One's health is essentially a genetic lottery. You shouldn't be punished because you were unlucky enough to develop cancer or be born with a blood disease\n\n- Health can be a direct result of economic conditions and people should not be punished because of the quality and quantity of food their parent(s) provide.\n\n- Education is essentially an economic lottery. If you don't have enough money to pay for college, good luck. Many people are only able to take out student loans because of a cosigner (or their parents outright pay it). Parent's don't have the credit? Your shit out of luck.\n\n- Education is the foundation for the future of society. Forget job opportunities for now, higher education provides valuable skills that cannot be learned anywhere else. By not providing equal opportunities, we are decreasing the intelligence of the population.\n\n- By educating the population, especially the poor, we will decrease crime as well. As of now, many poor kids know they'll never go to college even before they reach high school. By giving equal opportunity, kids will have incentive to stay in school and stay out of trouble. At least they *can* go to college.\n\n- By not providing free education and health care, we are putting our population into a deeper hole of debt, crime and stupidity. A smart and healthy population can contribute to society much more than the status quo (in America). \n\nEssentially, education and health are lotteries. Some get lucky while most don't. People should not be punished because of this. Investing money into an infrastructure that provides free education and health care is the basis for an advanced society.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The thing is that even when you see places with public healthcare and education, there are still the same problems.   \n\nI'm assuming your talking about the U.S.  There is free public education to before undergrad, but would expanding it to college really make the overall population smarter? High school education is the bare minimum for people to get work and usually the prospect isn't great. Making college public would basically make it the new high school. Standards will drop as it will essentially be mandatory.  Your still going to have the same divide with education as you do now.  It's just that bar is slightly higher.  \n\nMaking healthcare free would basically mean just taxing everyone more. It's not really free then. For the most people, people wouldn't be better off.

People are often irresponsible and their actions have a severe effect on healthcare costs. Those people who smoke, don't exercise, etc. are more likely to require expensive medical interventions.\n\nI absolutely agree with you that both education and healthcare are very important and do require public investment because they provide valuable benefits, but some of your logic is flawed.

{"index": 343, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:We'd be better off if Napoleon had won at Waterloo.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI don't particularly hold this view dearly, I just expect there might be some budding historians on Reddit with more information! It was influenced mostly by [this article](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/we-better-off-napoleon-never-lost-waterloo-180955298/?no-ist), which is fascinating if you just fancy some historical reading. Basically, if Napoleon has won at Waterloo, and completed his conquest of Europe (bar Russia, of course, and maybe England), the continent would have flourished economically, socially and politically, more so than now. I will highlight the main points below. \n\n\n**1. Revolutionary domestic reforms which all of Europe would have continued to benefit from.**\n\n*\"Yet he said he would be remembered not for his military victories, but for his domestic reforms, especially the Code Napoleon, that brilliant distillation of 42 competing and often contradictory legal codes into a single, easily comprehensible body of French law. In fact, Napoleon\u2019s years as first consul, from 1799 to 1804, were extraordinarily peaceful and productive. He also created the educational system based on lyc\u00e9es and grandes \u00e9coles and the Sorbonne, which put France at the forefront of European educational achievement. He consolidated the administrative system based on departments and prefects. He initiated the Council of State, which still vets the laws of France, and the Court of Audit, which oversees its public accounts. He organized the Banque de France and the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur, which thrive today. He also built or renovated much of the Parisian architecture that we still enjoy, both the useful\u2014the quays along the Seine and four bridges over it, the sewers and reservoirs\u2014and the beautiful, such as the Arc de Triomphe, the Rue de Rivoli and the Vend\u00f4me column.\"*\n\nNapoleon was an extraordinary governor. Many of his reforms are what the rest of Europe based their institutions on, only much later.\n\n\n**2. Napoleon was a lover, not a fighter.**\n\n*In September 1805, Austria invaded Napoleon\u2019s ally Bavaria, and Russia declared war on France as well. Napoleon swiftly won the ensuing War of the Third Coalition with his finest victory, at Austerlitz in 1805. The next year the Prussians also declared war on him, but they were soundly defeated at Jena; Napoleon\u2019s peace treaty of Tilsit with Russia and Prussia followed. The Austrians declared war on France once more in 1809, but were dispatched at the Battle of Wagram and signed yet another peace treaty.\n\nNapoleon started none of those wars, but he won all of them. After 1809 there was an uneasy peace with the three other Continental powers, but in 1812 he responded to France\u2019s being cut out of Russian markets\u2014in violation of the Tilsit terms\u2014by invading Russia. That ended in the catastrophic retreat from Moscow, which cost him more than half a million casualties and left his Grande Arm\u00e9e too vitiated to deter Austria and Prussia from joining his enemies Russia and Britain in 1813.*\n\nBar the Russian Invasion mistake (and I will concede that it was a hell of a mistake), Napoleon did not display the characteristics of a warmonger. Upon his return from exile, his charisma as a leader ensured he reclaimed the throne without shedding a drop of blood, as each army sent to fight him joined him immediately. \n\nWhen he was condemned by the allies in the Vienna Declaration, he wrote to them - \u201cAfter presenting the spectacle of great campaigns to the world, from now on it will be more pleasant to know no other rivalry than that of the benefits of peace, of no other struggle than the holy conflict of the happiness of peoples.\u201d\n\nYou can argue that it was just posturing, but there is no precedent to suggest it was not genuine.\n\n*He told his council that he had renounced any dream of reconstituting the empire and that \u201chenceforth the happiness and the consolidation\u201d of France \u201cshall be the object of all my thoughts.\u201d He refrained from taking measures against anyone who had betrayed him the previous year. \u201cOf all that individuals have done, written or said since the taking of Paris,\u201d he proclaimed, \u201cI shall forever remain ignorant.\u201d He immediately set about instituting a new liberal constitution incorporating trial by jury, freedom of speech and a bicameral legislature that curtailed some of his own powers; it was written by the former opposition politician Benjamin Constant, whom he had once sent into internal exile.*\n\nHe immediately set about refunding the art galleries and public buildings of Paris, in the 12 weeks before the war would begin.\n\n**3. Liberalism in the rest of Europe would have thrived.**\n\n*If Napoleon had remained emperor of France for the six years remaining in his natural life, European civilization would have benefited inestimably. The reactionary Holy Alliance of Russia, Prussia and Austria would not have been able to crush liberal constitutionalist movements in Spain, Greece, Eastern Europe and elsewhere; pressure to join France in abolishing slavery in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean would have grown; the benefits of meritocracy over feudalism would have had time to become more widely appreciated; Jews would not have been forced back into their ghettos in the Papal States and made to wear the yellow star again; encouragement of the arts and sciences would have been better understood and copied; and the plans to rebuild Paris would have been implemented, making it the most gorgeous city in the world.*\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR - Napoleon was an all round great dude, and great leader who accomplished so much in such little time. If he had stayed in power for the 6 more years until his death, France and Europe would have benefitted greatly from it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Napoleon's mistake at Russia (besides his lack of tactics in a big battle that led to many french men dying needlessly) was not turning around from Moscow as soon as he burned it. He ended up staying for another month in Moscow\n\n3) even if he won Waterloo he would have still faced opposition from the British who would have pounced after he died and stirred dissent\n\nSecond Response: \nNapoleon had very little chance of conquering Europe even if he had won at Waterloo. There was another massive Russian/Austrian army on the way to join the British and the Prussians. Almost all of Europe was fairly united in their opposition to Napoleon and you cannot wage war against an entire continent, no matter how good of a general you are. Add the fact that many of the reasons that were behind Napoleon's earlier successes were no longer present - the allies had reformed their armies, were coordinating their operations better, and learned from their previous mistakes. France, on the other hand, was drained of its manpower and was economically exhausted. In short, Napoleon's chances of rebuilding his empire were very slim. At best, he would be embroiled in continuous game of wack-a-mole where one part or another rebelled. It would be an unending war with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of casualties. \n\nThat aside, the article is extremely generous to Napoleon, more than he deserves. Napoleon crowned himself Emperor - hardly a republican thing to do. He invaded countries or threatened them  with invasion to make them comply with his demands. He installed his family members and close associates as kings and dukes of conquered territories. He forced conquered peoples to pay him taxes to fund his next campaigns and enforced the continental blockade against their will. \n\nYou can't really frame the Napoleonic wars as ones of republicanism  vs monarchism. Britain was a constitutional monarchy and was staunchly against Napoleon. In Spain, Napoleon faced a national uprising against his rule (or rather Napoleon's brother whom he tried to install as king).  \n\nSaying that Napoleon wanted peace in 1805 or 1809 is a bit disingenuous. Saddam Hussein also wanted peace after conquering Kuwait. Does that make the United States and the UN forced that launched Operation Desert Storm in 1991 the aggressors? Hitler didn't want war with Great Britain and France after he invaded Poland in 1939. They declared war on Germany - are they the aggressors? Why should we take 1805 or 1809 as the baseline?

{"index": 344, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Liberalism is currently undergoing a schism, and is splitting into two factions\n\nOriginal Post: \nFrom what I have observed, liberals tend to fall into one of two categories, both of which are vehemently opposed to the other.\n\nThe first faction is heavily focused on political correctness and the \u201csocial justice\u201d movement. They are major proponents of multiculturalism. They tend to view human social behavior as being socially constructed, and the result of the environment, and are often hostile towards evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of outcome than equality of opportunity. Mainstream feminists fall into this category. They are also more likely to support gun control than the second faction. They have more female members compared to the second faction, and are more likely to be religious.\nExamples of liberals in this faction include: Hillary Clinton, Laci Green, Mike Rugnetta, Trace Dominguez, PZ Myers, and Jen McCreight.\n\nThe second faction is liberal socially and economically, i.e. on abortion, gay marriage, drug liberalization, health care, etc., but is vehemently against the political correctness that the first faction espouses. They are also more averse to multiculturalism than the first faction. They tend to seek biological explanations for human behavior, and are more accepting of evolutionary psychology. They are more focused on equality of opportunity than equality of outcome. Almost all of the members of this faction are atheists. This faction is much more heavily male dominated than the first faction. They are also more likely to support gun rights compared to members of the first faction. They also tend to be more likely to criticize mainstream democrats, such as Barack Obama. Examples of liberals in this faction include: Richard Dawkins, George Carlin, TJ Kirk, Phil Mason, and Carl Benjamin.\n\nFirst Response: \nI'm not sure how exactly you can distinguish b/w these two \"factions\" based on the considerations you've provided. In my experience, members of the first faction are also socially and economically liberal on matters of abortion, gay marriage, health care, drug liberalization, and they do support multiculturalism. There's so much overlap that your theory doesn't make a whole lot of sense. \n\nIt seems to me that you've just separated them based primarily on gender, not issues. Is that accurate?\n\nAlso, can you provide proof of Obama's atheism? I'd love to see it. He has said that he isn't very religious, but never said that he rejects god. I've never heard it.\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nIt sounds like you're describing young liberals on the internet; I recognize the dichotomy you describe, and I would only object that it oversimplifies, but I'd also say you're missing out on a huge portion of liberals:\n\n* Business liberals, who lean towards classic liberalism but still with leftist tendencies; basically center-left business people. A media example is the Economist.\n* Radical leftists, who essentially reject capitalism and are deeply concerned with international issues, viewing most western diplomacy as imperialist or neocolonialist. A media example is Al Jazeera English.\n* Unions and Labor. They draw from a long left-leaning tradition, even though their members are often socially conservative.\n* The silent majority, who mostly favor liberal policies but would be very confused if you talked to them about how you thought evo psych was a defining schism issue in liberal politics.\n\nAlso, I'd point out that evolutionary psychology doesn't make normative prescriptions. For instance, we can accept the evo psych explanation for overconsumption of greasy and sugary foods and still acknowledge that a person's life benefits from a balanced diet.

{"index": 346, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: there is no legal or moral argument against allowing incestuous marriage that hasn't been thrown away in pursuit of gay marriage.\n\nOriginal Post: \nTo start: **I am *not* saying that homosexuality and incest are the same thing.**\n\nHowever, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.\n\nSo with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nThe main problem with your argument is that gays are a *class* of people, while people with incestuous feelings are just individuals with incestuous feelings.\n\nBasically, it is wrong to discriminate against people simply because they belong to a specific group. It is, however, perfectly OK to discriminate against individuals because of their individual traits.\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspect_classification#Federal_classifications) are some of the legal definitions of what constitutes a 'class' of people. I'm not going to summarize 'em. You have to do some work and read 'em yourself. But the two main groups are the suspect classes and the rational-basis classes. *Suspect* classes include race or religion, and the government needs to show a compelling reason to allow discrimination. *Rational-basis* classes are groups like criminals vs. non-criminals, where there may be a rational reason to allow discrimination.\n\nTwo choice quotes:\n\n&gt;In Perry v. Schwarzenegger, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in its Findings of Fact commented that sexual orientation could be considered a **suspect** class[...]\n\nand:\n\n&gt;Striking down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in Windsor v. United States (2012), the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals held sexual orientation to be a **quasi-suspect** classification\n\nHere you have the courts arguing over which kind of classification that gays belong to (*suspect* vs. *quasi-suspect* class) but agreeing that gays do belong to something stronger than just a rational-basis classification.\n\nSiblings with incestuous feelings? I guarantee they would fall under the 'rational-basis' classification, meaning there is a lower bar for the gov't to clear in order to justify discrimination.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; marriage is not about reproduction. \n\nThis is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring. \n\nI imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains a respectful and reasoned tone while directly addressing the original post's points. It acknowledges the original poster's argument about marriage not being solely about reproduction and offers a more nuanced discussion about the implications of incestuous relationships. This empathetic engagement is likely to resonate more with someone who is contemplating their views.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs counterarguments effectively by not only recognizing the original poster\u2019s points but also expanding upon them with additional reasoning. It presents a clear distinction between gay marriage and incestuous marriage that focuses on the potential societal ramifications.\n\n3. **Structure and Readability**: The second response has a clear structure with logical progression. Each point builds on the previous ones, making it easier to understand and digest for the original poster. In contrast, the first response has a more legalistic approach that may feel more detached and less engaging, potentially alienating the original poster from its argument.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response shows a willingness to engage with the logical framework of the original post while introducing an additional perspective on the implications of consent and health in incestuous relationships. This dynamic exchange is more likely to encourage reflection on the original poster's part and could lead to a change in their view. \n\nIn summary, the second response appears more relatable and well-rounded in its arguments, making it more successful in potentially changing the original poster's view.", "is_correct": false}

I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders. I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.\nThat said, I'm starting to feel a little lost. I cringe when I see the word \"thinkpiece.\" I hate that people get so caught up in a perpetual outrage machine and so high off their own self-righteousness they will destroy a life like Justine Sacco's (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0) for sport. (Also, how great is Sam Biddle for basically admitting he'd do it all over again for \"the clickz?\") I have to believe that the right or, \"The Man,\" are absolutely loving this infighting. Endless digital ink is spilled on Black Widow in The Avengers while cops are still shooting anyone with a skin tone darker than Burnt Sienna.\n\nAm I wrong? Am I the asshole here? Is all of this of vital importance? Will the 24/7/365 internet analytical news cycle bring us to the promised land? Or is this just a tool of cultural commentators on a deadline?\n\nEDIT:  I'll add this since I'm getting a lot of advice to get off twitter.  I definitely don't go on as much as I used to, but it's hard for me to stay off completely for two reasons.  One, there's a lot of actually good, funny twitterers out there.  It's also a good news source, it's how I found out we got Bin Laden.  Two, as someone who, despite all warning signs, wants to be involved someday in the comedy/entertainment biz, it's kinda necessary for those on the come up to use it as a promotional tool.  If I was Spielberg or Tarantino I'd get the hell off, trust me.  But I'm a nobody from nowhere at the moment.\n\nTry not to focus on the Twitter thing as much.  There's pieces on Gawker, WaPo and Daily Dot that I've used for examples.  Here's a piece on the AVClub where the writer complains about female fans of Captain Marvel for... reasons.  Not sure.  They're problematic somehow.\n\nhttp://www.avclub.com/article/marvel-learned-wrong-lessons-carol-corps-218003\n\nEDIT 2:  Not sure how much longer this'll stay active, or how much I'll be able to check in tomorrow so I'll do a pseudo-wrap up here.  I used mainly examples from the comedy world and Twitter since that's what immediately came to mind.  Other examples I could've used were Donglegate (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/) and ScientistShirtgate (http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2014/11/18/scientist-shirt-feminism-comet-your-say/19248543/).  I think those two, and there are others, are also worthy of discussion in that they involve nuance.  Someone like Donald Trump, that's a black-and-white case of racism.  \n\nSomeone in the comments said this seemed like neurotic hand-wringing by an alienated individual, and that could very well be the case.  I didn't really spend a whole lot of time making a comprehensive essay about this because a-it's just reddit and b-I posted from the gut with immediacy.  If someone wants to take this theme and do it up better, by all means go for it.  I never claimed to be a social scientist.  Or even just social.\n\nSome good opinions here, with the major consensus being that these things seem big and important on the internet where everything is a hot take and people are either Lawful Good or Chaotic Evil with no in-between.  So in stepping out from the cyberspace will keep the perspective in check.\n\nGood talk everyone!  No name calling or trolling!\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I'm not going to argue that the \"PC police\" is inherently good and that the way we're approaching these issues (person said something questionable, ergo, he's a shitlord) isn't somewhat problematic and toxic in the long run, because I believe most of the sites you've linked to are approaching issues in a totally different way than I think would be most helpful. Rather, what I'll argue is something more cynical:\n\nThe publishers pushing the \"overboard social justice\" shenanigans you're talking about are doing exactly what they should, because what they're publishing is getting truckloads of clicks more than a nuanced take on the situation. Financially, what they're doing makes total sense.\n\nLook at it this way: Say you've got two articles dealing with remarks made by a Fortune 500 CEO that could easily be construed as sexist. The article from Publication A is a 3,000-word inquiry into the deeper sentiments held behind those remarks, which treats the CEO as a human being with human prejudices (prejudices similar to those that all people hold) and examines why, exactly, those sexist remarks are so hurtful in a deeply nuanced tone which invites deeper critical consideration and doesn't provide an easy emotional response. The article from Publication B is an 800-word evisceration of the CEO as a horrible, unredeemable person representing everything wrong with corporate culture and a beacon of light for slug-headed sexists everywhere. It jumps straight to anger, because it knows it can get its readers angry enough to share the article.\n\nWhich do you think will get more clicks, shares, and comments?\n\nEmotion is a powerful force, and many publications are very skilled at manipulating that. I'm white, male, and straight, so I don't have the kind of anger at our society that many minority groups hold. However, many US women are exhausted by the harassment and bigotry they face as a part of the experience of being a woman in the US. Same with people of color, same with LGBTQA+ people, same with non-Christian people (especially Muslims). They're the target audience for many of these pieces - the articles tap into the anger they feel at having to survive as a \"lesser person\" simply because of some part of their identity they can't control. As such, if an article can trigger that kind of strong emotion, the author of the article knows that with a snappy headline and angry enough writing, they can make an article \"worth sharing.\"\n\nAt some level, I think that the \"PC-ness,\" as you put it, is justified. People want ways to vent their frustration at being oppressed in America while people bluster on about how we're in a post-racial society and such, and these quick, snarky, angry articles are a perfect way to encapsulate that rage (even if that rage might not be the most constructive). There are so many people who are pissed, always at the boiling point because society hasn't let them be anywhere else. However, since they're always at the boiling point, countless publications have figured out the buttons they need to push in order to boil them over the sides of the pot. And, until something changes, that's the best business strategy for most of these publications - whatever gets clicks, you know?\n\ntl;dr - What you're describing isn't super helpful, but, hey, clicks and profit!\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;I was, am and will be a dyed-in-the-patchouli liberal. I was ecstatic that gays can get married now. I will call Caitlyn Jenner whatever SHE wants me to. I'm a big fan of Bernie Sanders.*I absolutely believe all fortysomething of Bill Cosby's accusers.*\n\nOne of these things is not like the others.  (100% with you on those first four, btw). And herein lies the problem that you're talking about.  *Why* do you believe them, despite having only heresay and no solid evidence to rely on?  \n\nBecause you've conflated the idea of their victimhood with your own open-minded liberalness.  You think that to question them would be to reject your *political* beliefs.   That not taking them for their word would betray your principles.   This is an ideological response; and psychologically speaking it is very similar to the reaction religiously devout people have to something that violates the rules of their religion (Such as why so many Christians are mad that gay marriage is now legal).   \n\nIn reality, though without doubt it is highly likely that at least *some* of those women are telling the truth, you and I cannot possibly know that, and so to say that you \"absolutely\" believe *all* of them reflects that you *absolutely* do not want anyone to question where you stand on that issue, lest they challenge your ideological purity/sincerity, or worse: Accuse you of being a bigot.  You aren't just a bad person for not sharing their views, You don't share their views *because you're a bad person*.   There are remarkable parallels between the radical left and the religious fundamentalist in this regard.  \n\nThat's the problem: It's ideological.   Not rational, not even about what's right or wrong.  Political extremism is about \"US\" vs \"Them\".  And ideological purity is expected by radicals.   Social pressure deters people from questioning, criticizing, or disagreeing.    To suggest that maybe we should wait until we know the facts before judging is tantamount to being a rape apologist and a misogynist to the far-left crowd.    \n\nThen there's the media.   Washington Post, Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, etc.   These publications primarily generate readership by pandering to those extremists.   Washington Post is to Liberalism what Jezebel is to women's equality.   \n\nI won't even get into the tumblr/twitter \"opression olympics\"  (as a gay man, I am allowed to have *some* opinions, but they're not as valid as say, a gay *woman*, because she is by virtue of being female more oppressed than me, etc.)  \n\nIdeological extremism ceases to be about justice, or right and wrong, or even the *truth*.   In radical politics, the truth will always be viewed through the funhouse mirror of the ideologue.  \n\nThe key is to step back from the labels, and from what you've been *told* to believe, and just start thinking about the foundational goals of social justice.   That everyone should have equal standing under the law, equal opportunities and equal protections within our society.   That the horrors and injustices of history ( and the present day) must be stopped, and the damage done corrected as much as this can possibly be done.     \n\nWe have to get away from ideology and indoctrination, and encourage people to use their brains.   Then it will become apparent who really wants a better world, and who is just looking out for their own selfish desires.  \n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the Second Response's direct engagement with the original poster's (OP) stated beliefs and experiences, particularly in the realm of victimhood and ideological purity.

{"index": 349, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: We Should execute the weak to improve the human genepool and reduce overpopulation\n\nOriginal Post: \n\n_____\n\nAlright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.\nI believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.\nYou look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.\nNow to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.\nWhat will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.\nWhat the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.\nHow we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.\nNow another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.\nI would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.\nThis is all i can think of for now, if i remember more of my plan i will post. So reddit users, change my view.\n\nFirst Response: \nYou are complaining about humans not letting evolution take place (I'll come to that too), but at the same time you want to counteract what humans evolved to become - supportive of the weak.\n\nThe fact that humans help each other out and save the weak (first in tribes, now in nation states) allowed humans to take over the world. You help me now that I'm weak, I help you another time when you're weak. We both survive, instead of neither of us surviving. Remember, it's survival of the fittest, and fittest doesn't necessarily mean strongest.\n\nNow, I don't see how we're not letting evolution take place. Evolution doesn't mean that in every generation only the strongest are allowed to survive. Evolution means that the genes which are most likely to survive through multiple generations in bodies that are likely to reproduce are likely to be spread the most. So if being determined enough to acquire sufficient wealth to be able to reproduce even if you are fat means that you are more likely to reproduce, then that means that that's a gene that's likely to spread, and that's evolution.\n\nAnd if you really want to solve overpopulation problems, there's far less radical ways to solve that (development help for third world countries etc.). Or just kill everyone who is too old to reproduce.\n\nSecond Response: \nI could write two dozen things in opposition to this, but just to gather a few basic points.\n\n-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.\n\n-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.\n\n-There are any number of political oppositions I have to this but I won't get to deep into them as ultimately that's my ethical viewpoint vs. yours.  Needless to say, I think measuring the value of a human being wholly by their ability to produce and work for their country is a fascist viewpoint, and the ability of an individual to pass any kind of mental or psychological test(which undoubtedly would be designed by rich white people) is strongly dependent on the situation and opportunities they grew up with, so it doesn't even remotely approach an accurate genetic test.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To determine which response is more likely to have changed the original poster's view (OP), we will analyze the tone, emotional approach, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, readability, and engagement with the OP in both responses.\n\n**First Response:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:** \n   - The tone of the first response is somewhat accusatory yet also informative.

{"index": 350, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Bill Nye is not a real scientist in any meaningful way to the public.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI submit that Nye's public perception of 'being a scientist' is largely overblown by childhood memories. In his history, he had one 'scientific' accolade: he developed a device for Boeing years before he was every famous. Beyond that, he's just been a guy on TV reading from a script.\n\nEven working at Boeing, his primary job was that of a TV persona: he made the training videos. \n\nI feel that Obama's use of Nye regarding global warming is strictly an appeal to the populace who grew up watching a kid show, not the opinion of a professional with a background in anything remotely related to climate. This doesn't mean I disagree with what he said, but only disagree with the idea that he should be trusted 'as a scientist'. He's a PR tool in that regard. He only parrots others' research - in everything he's done -not anything he actually observed through his own research. \n\nFurther, simply having a degree in a scientific background makes you aware of that background (he has a bachelor's in *engineering* from Cornell), but that doesn't make you a scientist in the field. I know many people with degrees in one field who work in an entirely different field. A law degree doesn't make you a lawyer, for instance. My father has one and he's a retired contractor: never worked a legal case in his life. Nye's background hardly applies to the vast majority of his TV demonstrations and appearances.\n\nAnd to the point of Carl Sagan, Neil Tyson, and others: these are actual scientists who have been published, who do(did) research in the field of their degree and beyond. Yes, these men are TV personas, but unlike Nye they're actually also scientists. \n\nSo? Change my view. He's one of my childhood heroes too, but I simply can't accept him as a scientist. I feel that cheapens real work by real scientists.\n\nEdit: [Delta awarded](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3bf41n/cmv_bill_nye_is_not_a_real_scientist_in_any/cslnyww), albeit not in a way I had in mind. It's technically correct, [but we all know...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo)\n\nTo many of the comments: \n\n- Education is important and admirable, but that still doesn't make you a scientist in my view. If that's the standard of calling oneself a scientist while being displayed on news media as an expert to be listened to, then really, there's no measure for what an expert is in that regard.  \n\n- There are many qualified scientists who are also good on TV: I still assert Nye's appearances were heavily caused by his association as the funny lab-coat and bow-tie 'science guy' and childhood memories, which is a manipulative and deceptive thing to do when appearing in support of public policy (regardless of my agreement and my own support of the same policy). That deception was not unintentional, but calculated. Herein lies my problem and reasoning for this post. I should note that this still stands as my view, and the delta awarded was awarded basically because I worded the post in a particular way. If anyone would like to address this view, I'd award another delta if the mods are okay with it. \n\n- I really, honestly think that comparing Nye and people like Neil Tyson and Carl Sagan is an insult to the latter two. That's like comparing your high school bio teacher to the same two men. That's utterly absurd in my mind: Tyson and Sagan contributed more to their fields than Nye ever could at this point. \n\n- Nye's only contribution I can see, which is the reason for the single delta awarded thus far, has been in the development and design of a hydraulic pressure resonance suppressor used for 747s, to this day. I concede this is a meaningful, scientific advancement for the public made by Bill Nye. \n\nFirst Response: \nA scientist is an expert in a science. I think that's a fair definition of  scientist we could agree to. Now the question is is he an expert? I say yes because he graduated with a BS in mechanical engineering which is absolutely a science. Experts in mechanical engineering make innovations and inventions via the scientific method. Given that Bill Nye fits this acceptable definition of a scientist, he is therefore a scientist. Is the the same as Tyson or Sagan? Hell no. Tyson and Sagan are astrophysicists and Nye's an engineer. Are they the same? No. Are they all scientists? Yes.\n\nSecond Response: \nI agree with you 100%. In fact, I was the OP on the other thread about Bill Nye not actually being a scientist and I came away with my V not C'ed. I will tell you what I thought was the best point though: there are lots of people involved in the discovery and dissemination of science and we don't have an umbrella term for all of them. They all contribute to science in some way but only the scientific researcher gets to be called a scientist? Why not call the whole lot of them scientists and the teacher is a science teacher, the researcher is a science researcher, the administrator is a science administrator, etc. The umbrella usage of \"scientist\" would also agree with the publics notion of a scientist even if it doesn't jive with how people that actually do science would use the term.\n\nIts a view that I don't necessarily agree with since the application of the scientific method is the pure grist of science and only the researcher is doing this, but I think that it was at least an interesting thought.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the first response's focus on defining what a scientist is and establishing Bill Nye's qualifications within that framework. By presenting a clear and logical argument that aligns Nye's educational background with the accepted definition of a scientist, the first response addresses the original poster's concerns directly and provides a rational basis for considering Nye a scientist. The tone is factual and supportive while also acknowledging the differences between Nye, Tyson, and Sagan.\n\nIn contrast, the second response lacks a strong persuasive element and instead aligns too closely with the original post\u2019s skepticism, asserting agreement without challenging the OP's views. It introduces a thought-provoking idea about the classification of various roles within science but doesn't present a compelling counter-argument that would effectively change the original poster's view.

{"index": 351, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:Climate change should be the dominant international issue for politicians and activists today.\n\nOriginal Post: \nScientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced sea and ice cover, and drought. These effects will in turn impact not only human's general well-being, but will also displace coastal settlements and cities, negatively effect food sources, destroy ecosystems, and more.\nFurthermore,\n&gt; \"It is increasingly evident that the policy actions by these countries and others will not be enough to stave off a rise in the atmospheric temperature of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. At that point, scientists say, the planet will be locked into a future of extreme storms, droughts, food and water shortages, and rising sea levels.\"\n\nThus, I think the number one concern for the human race as a whole should be climate change, and I find it hard to justify any other causes. Yes, human rights and the economy are important, immediate concerns--But, in the end, it won't matter in if the planet becomes uninhabitable. So climate change and efforts to reverse or combat it should be the dominant issue in the world now. Instead, of focusing on raising the minimum wage or gay rights, we should devote most of our resources and energy to solving climate change.\nI'm liberal.

In all probability it will cause widespread famine and kill innumerable people through hunger.  Don't get me wrong, it will be horrific and expansive in it's scope, but it won't be the end of humanity.  Ultimately what we're talking about then is prospect of world hunger.  How is that different from the other global problem; current world hunger?  If you think about it long enough, you'll realize that it's just that this one has the potential of killing *you* and *me* while the other one has the potential of killing off kids in places so poor that the internet doesn't exist.\n\nIt's hard to make the argument that one is worse.  It's just that one is worse *for you and me*.\n\nWould you then agree that since the current world hunger is a problem we are experiencing and climate change is a problem we may one day experience; then current world hunger should be added to the front of the line?  \n\n\n&gt;  Instead, of focusing on raising the minimum wage or gay rights, we should devote most of our resources and energy to solving climate change. \n\nOr lets make the perspective more granular.  If you are working 80 hours a week at minimum wage to pay for your family's bills.  You can get them to survive, but you can't afford an education or any other luxuries.  Your kids will have to work as soon as they are humanly able, thereby forgoing their opportunities to progress and perpetuating the cycle.  Given that situation, would you also think that your life of quasi-slavery is less important than the potential of global warming?\n\n\nIt all comes down to survival.  I can see why you would argue that survival is important when you are in danger.  I cannot see how you can make an objective case where your survival is more important than another's survival.\n\nSecond Response: \nHow do you know it's not one of the dominant issues if not the top issue already? Everybody talks about it. But one thing I wish we could focus on is real solutions like more efficient ways to produce and distribute food (Hint: the solution isn't shipping chicken from the U.S. to China for processing and then shipping it back to the U.S.), ways to produce energy that doesn't involve burning a lot of fossil fuels or use up a lot of land the way solar panel \"farms\" do, etc., etc. We know what the problem is. We just need real world solutions to solving it that don't presume that every individual human is going to make drastic changes to their lifestyles just to cut down on their impact. At this point, climate change is likely to get worse before it gets better no matter what we do. Now it's just a matter of making sure humanity can survive the experience even if it means finding all the *right* ways to change a planet.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response**: The tone is somewhat confrontational and challenges the original poster's perspective directly.

This just seems idiotic to me. Especially considering that only certain minorities have an easier time getting in, while others like asians have a much harder time. It should be based on your grade average and the score you get on your SAT (I'm from Canada so I'm not really sure how SAT score factors into that. I'm used to only your high school grades being counted). If an asian student gets a 90% average, his/her application shouldn't be tossed aside for a black student who only managed to get an 83% average.

Standardized tests are biased towards white people, non-white people are more likely to be underserved, mistreated, or abused by law enforcement, non-white people are more likely to suffer poverty, etc. These disadvantages, to a large degree, are the direct result of racist laws and culture that existed a few generations ago, so even if you think that society is no longer racist (it is) you cannot deny that the effects of racism from a few generations ago is still being felt.\n\nThe policies you're talking about in your post are meant to, in one small particular way, compensate for the huge disadvantages that non-white people are faced with during their entire journey to university.\n\nYou cannot ignore the disadvantages faced by others which have given you a great benefit up until now, and then point out the very few instances where you lack a particular advantage and call that unfair.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; If you don't do good in school, it's either because your capacity to learn in that certain subject or in general is lower than other people (say being bad at math or English) or you just didn't try hard enough.\n\nThis just isn't true. Some parents don't stress education as much. Some parents don't provide a good structure that allows their kids to value education and learn. Some parents can't be there to help their kid with math homework.\n\nA 9 year old can't be expected to be mature enough to understand how important an education is. That kid basically does what his/her parents tell them.

I don't like how they say \"well my brain is more feminine\", like excuse me that's something that women have been trying to get away from for 1000 years. Why did Caitlyn Jenner feel the best way to become a woman was to get all trussed up in a corset on the cover of vanity fair? Why are so many m2f trans people so into makeup and fashion?! If that's what being a woman is to you then why not stick to drag? In conclusion, an article that lines up with my views. http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/sunday/what-makes-a-woman.html\n\nFirst Response: \nAs a trans woman (and more importantly as a trans person in general), we are often backed into corners by society: you think that trans women portray themselves as too feminine with dresses and makeup and etc., yet if a trans woman would be seen with hairy legs or facial hair shadow, with no makeup and a short haircut, others might say that she isn't \"trans enough\" or a \"real woman\" because she doesn't conform to these gender roles/expressions or even that she \"looks like a guy.\" We're judged by somebody either way, and I think most of us would rather lean toward the direction of gender expression that allowed us to be more often read as our true gender because we've been misgendered all our lives.\n\nEdit: I want to add another point. Why don't cis women get this sort of backlash? Cis women are all over magazines in all sorts of over-the-top feminine outfits and expressions. Why is one trans woman who looks nice and is all done up on the cover of *vanity fair* the enemy of feminists? \n\nAnd a final point about the language used in the title, trans women aren't *portraying what it means to be female*. They *are* female. They are just being themselves. As any cis woman is.\n\nSecond Response: \nI get where you're coming from. I used to think similarly to you, but after I befriended some trans people, and other people in my life became comfortable enough to come out, I learned more. \n\nWhile some hyper-feminine trans women and hyper-masculine trans  men are genuinely just someone who naturally acts like the gender stereotype, a good amount of people who are trans feel a need to overcompensate. I also know some trans people who don't feel the need to preform gender roles, but feel pushed to do so too by people around them or society in general. For example I know a trans woman, but she still doesn't feel like dresses or skirts are really her thing, nor does it bother her to have a bit of stubble, or hairy legs. She'll get comments along the line of 'she's not really trans,' or 'if she actually wanted to be a woman, she'd do x and y'.\n\nSo non-gender-conforming trans people exist, but they're not really in the spot light. It's understandable, because we cis people do seem to have even more trouble wrapping our heads around why someone would feel like a man but still want to wear skirts, especially when we're still learning to accept the fact that some people we think of as women are actually men, and vice versa.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the direct engagement and passionate defense of trans identities present in the First Response.

{"index": 354, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: There is no \"wrong time\" to break up with someone\n\nOriginal Post: \nYou often hear complaints that a person is a bastard/bitch for breaking up with his/her girlfriend/boyfriend just before/after X event (be it a graduation, Christmas, death in the family etc.). I think that this is entirely unreasonable. If one has made up his/her mind to break it off with a romantic partner, there is no need to delay the inevitable. There will invariably be some reason why \"now is not the best time.\" Further, it is dishonest to stay with a person for any length of time after deciding conclusively that \"this person is not right for me and never will be.\" Staying in the face of certain relationship termination just to get past X event is unfair to both individuals involved. \n\nObviously this train of thought only applies to long-term committed relationships rather than casual or non-exclusive ones. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

{"index": 355, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Touch-Typing should be a required skill for university.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI think it's safe to say that almost everyone in the world uses a keyboard now. And yet, the vast majority of people have no idea how to type without looking at the keys and often hunting and pecking. I personally consider this a major problem because I think it is holding us back to some extent.\n\nSome points that I use to support this argument:\n\n1. Faster typing = more productivity, businesses would benefit. You could do more paperwork, more homework, anything on the computer. I'd argue that if everybody could type, we'd all have more free time as well, or at the very least GDP would increase as we get more work done in less time. \n\n2. It's useful for personal and professional activities: Even if all you do is type posts on facebook and write an email to your grandkids, knowing how to type will help you.\n\n3. It's easy to learn. It's all muscle memory, and if you practiced for an hour a day you'd be good in a month. Plus there are programs galore for it. \n\nSo, my view is that if university required you to know how to touch-type, perhaps with a modest WPM test on entry, or at least a freshman-year course, people would be forced to learn it and would become better typists, thus benefiting everyone down the line. \n\nWhy university? Because minimum wage workers don't usually need to type on a computer, making it less necessary at the high school level. Also, in university, you'll be typing a hell of a lot. I don't care what course you take, you'll need to type up essays and ultimately a thesis paper. \n\nAm I overblowing this? To quote the great Mugatu, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. To me it's at least as important as learning how to write with a pen these days. I'd just like to understand why society currently seems to place no value in this skill, and that maybe I'm overreacting. \n\n**Edit 1**\n\nWell, thanks for all the comments, it's been a very interesting discussion so far. \n\nThe argument that's hanging onto me the most is that the keyboard may become obsolete, but I can't see that happening soon enough to justify ignoring a useful skill.\n\nFor those who point out that we can learn it of our own free will and it's not the university's place, I feel that the long-term benefits of such a policy change benefit us in the long term. Universities often require you to study other things they feel are beneficial, such as learning another language (which is often taught inadequately), so I don't feel that it's outside the potential scope of a university to require typing.\n\nAnd for those pointing out that it isn't worth the time, I maintain that learning costs next to nothing, and it saves you time over the course of your life if you add up every time you type.\n\n**Edit 2, View Changed**\n\n/u/cheeseboyardee made the point that not everyone learns at the same rate and some people may not be able to learn to type well, and thus mandating it could exclude otherwise capable people. \n\nThanks for all the posts and cordial discussion. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Typing \"the quick fox jumped over the lazy brown dog\" over and over again for an entire week with a piece of paper covering the keyboard. \n\nI topped out at about 30 WPM after 10 weeks of the course with more typos and misplaced spaces than are appropriate. (About 20 WPM if I was copying text.)\n\nBy looking at the keyboard I actually slow my mind down to focus on the word I am typing at the moment instead of getting ahead of myself. Moves me up to 40-50 wpm with fewer mistakes. To catch up to how fast the words go through my head I would need to be closer to my reading speed (300ish WPM).  The speed difference trying to touch type is unbearable, the increase in allowing myself to see the keyboard helps make it bearable. \n\nOffering touch typing courses is going to be a good idea. \n\nRequiring it for admission is not. Especially in countries that have massive disparities between school districts in terms of the availability of technology. Not every student has regular prolonged access to a keyboard or the internet in order to develop that skill. \n\nSaying anything is \"Easy to learn\" leaves off the second half of that sentence. Which is \"...For me.\" Other people have different skills and abilities and learn different skills at different rates. Even something as simple as singing a simple tune is nearly impossible for some. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI'm an engineering grad student, and I never saw a need to type faster. If you're writing so quickly that you're limited by your WPM, you're probably not being very concise. For example it takes me about 10-20 hours to write a 3000 word paper. \n\nBased on your reasoning, speed reading would be 100x more useful than being able to type fast.

{"index": 357, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Amazon Echo is an incredibly harmful piece of technology.\n\nOriginal Post: \nA lot of futuristic technology has floundered lately (3D TV, Google Glass, etc.) but Amazon Echo can be incredibly harmful if it takes off.\n\n[Watch the launch video to understand what Amazon Echo is.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQn6aFQwBQU) If you don't have the time, this is the pitch:\n\nAmazon Echo is designed around your voice. It's hands-free and always on. With seven microphones and beam-forming technology, Echo can hear you from across the room\u2014even while music is playing. Echo is also an expertly tuned speaker that can fill any room with immersive sound.\n\nEcho connects to Alexa, a cloud-based voice service, to provide information, answer questions, play music, read the news, check sports scores or the weather, and more\u2014instantly. All you have to do is ask.\n\nEssentially, it is an omnipresent Siri that lives in your home and is constantly listening. The device already has 23,058 reviews from testers and it is just hitting the market. Now imagine one of these in everyone's home. I will cover some of the highlights of the launch video as examples in my argument.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 1: Laziness**\n\nA lot of technology today encourages laziness. However, this takes it to a whole new level.\n\nExample: \"Alexa, add waffles to my shopping list.\" Now we don't even need to jot things down or even type them into our smart phones at the very least.\n\nExample: 'Alexa can provide news!' Instead of reading the newspaper or watching the news we can listen to a mono-tone robot recite world events.\n\nExample: \"Alexa, what is the chance of rain?\" The woman is literally standing next to the door when she asks this question. However, she would rather receive the weather from her nifty new gadget than to actually look outside or watch a weather report.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 2: Reliance on Technology**\n\nMost of us can admit that we are uncomfortably dependent on our smart phones. However, what if our smart phone was never in our pocket? What if it was always plugged in and tempting us? This is essentially Amazon Echo. The narrator even proclaims that Echo will, \"Become a part of the family!\"\n\nExample: \"The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning.\" This is a quote from a mother as she dresses her daughter. I am aware that these are commercially invented situations being reenacted by paid actors. However, I feel as though they are fairly accurate depictions of how people will use this technology and how they will respond to it. Clearly, there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together.\n\nExample: \"The prime re-ordering is when you can ask Alexa to order something you've already ordered through your prime account.\" Now we can shop by shouting a phrase at a robot! No need to go out.\n\nI think laziness coupled with reliance on technology have been the most harmful qualities that todays youth (myself included) suffer from. We find it difficult to go out and make plans. We find it difficult to socialize. We find it difficult to talk on the phone. In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way? We want things instantaneously and at our discretion.\n\n---\n\n**Reason 3: Invasion of Privacy**\n\nMajor corporations will do anything to learn more about consumers and what they want. Echo allows consumers to order things through Amazon Prime. I am not afraid of what this AI will do granted that it can always hear and learn. As long as it's just a black cylinder speaker (with no hidden flame-thrower) I don't believe we have a reason to fear an Echo uprise. Rather, I am more afraid of what the men and women behind the scenes will do. \n\nExample: 'Echo can hear you from anywhere in the room, so it's always ready to help!' \"I can have the water running, I can be cooking, the TV can be on in the back room, and she still can hear me.\" \n\nAll I could think while watching this was, \"Genisys is Skynet!\"\n\n---\n\nHere is a link to the [Amazon page.](http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E)\n\nSo, can anyone give me some reason as to why Amazon Echo can be more helpful than harmful?\n\n**Edit:** View changed by /u/fssbmule1 with [this comment!](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3f0uzz/cmv_amazon_echo_is_an_incredibly_harmful_piece_of/ctkbyhm) Great points.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nI'm going to break down each point separately.\n\n1) Amazon Echo creates laziness - So your examples are someone dictating instead of writing, listening to news instead of reading, and asking about weather instead of just looking outside. \n\nDictating has been around for quite almost ever. Just because the person isn't writing it down doesn't make them lazy. If we are making assumptions, you can assume that maybe they are becoming more organized and efficient with their time.\n\nAs for listening to the news, you could say it's exactly like watching the news on TV or on the Internet. Or it's like listening to the radio. Listening instead of reading is not laziness. It may even make news slightly more accessible which would inform more people (the argument of informing them correctly or incorrectly is a different subject for a different day).\n\nAs for weather, I love the weather and just by looking outside I could not tell you what the weather will be like. I still need technology to give me a close educated guess based on stats and history to tell me how hot it's going to be or if there will be a late afternoon shower or if it's going to snow so much that I should probably stay home.\n\nThis idea that accessing information by voice is not laziness. It is just another method of educating ourselves in whatever we want to know.\n\n2) Amazon Echo creates a reliance on technology - I think you slightly used the \"The echo is a tool that we use to keep our household functioning.\" out of context. First of all, they use it as a tool, much like a cell phone helps keep the household functioning, much like refrigerators help, much like a car helps. These tools do certain things that help make our lives easier so we can spend more time doing whatever we want, or as the ad depicts, spend more time with the family. Secondly, the Echo is not depicted doing anything that current technologies can't already do.\n\nAs for shopping, what is the harm in ordering toilet paper by asking your Echo to do so? While yes, some people may go out less because of this, they probably already weren't going out because you can order everything online, without the Echo. And, as the ad shows, this feature (along with others) can be extremely helpful for those with disabilities.\n\n3) Amazon Echo is an Invasion of Privacy - This is a running theme with the Internet of Things. Any piece of technology that can connect to the internet can be used to collect your information and sell it to whoever wants it. The Echo is not the only thing that does this.\n\nNow for it always listening. Sure, slightly terrifying, but it would take a lot of work Amazon to parse through audio from 24/7/365 just to find out what you like and don't like. They will probably keep track of your commands, but they (and most websites, companies, apps, etc.) already do. And for the most part, the big companies use this information to make your experiences with them better. Yes, nefarious things may happen, but companies take big risks by doing so. Just look at [Lenovo and the Superfish fiasco](http://www.cnet.com/news/lenovo-hit-by-lawsuit-over-superfish-adware/#!) and [Samsung with their always listening TVs](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/02/09/385001258/samsungs-privacy-policy-warns-customers-their-smart-tvs-are-listening).\n\nIn summary, this device is not harmful because it makes information more accesible (which does not create laziness), it does things that current technology already does, and it is no more of a spy on your life, than your phone or computer already is. In fact, as the video shows, it can make life easier for those with disabilities.\n\nSecond Response: \nyou are inconsistently and ambiguously defining your concerns, and false attributing consequences to technology without offering any data to support your claims.\n\nReason 1: Laziness\n\nwhy is jotting a note down on paper less lazy than adding it to a cloud-based shopping list through a voice interface? have you actually used the two side by side? using paper is frequently the fastest method there. using echo, not only do you have to wait for the device to confirm whether it actually performed the action, you have to take out a phone, unlock it, launch an app, and wait for a load before you can even use your shopping list. paper is instantaneous, and you could argue that it's the laziest option. 'it feels lazier' is not a valid conclusion supported by data.\n\nReason 2: Reliance on Technology\n\nyou are already completely, utterly, and irreversibly reliant on technology. others have made this point but i want to stress the absolute and total reality of it to you. every single item around you is human technology. building a fire is technology. you will die very quickly if you stopped using technology. you failed to demonstrate why reliance on technology is bad in general, and why reliance on echo is bad specifically. \n\nyou say\n&gt;'clearly there are many issues with one piece of technology keeping a household together' \n\nbut you do not elaborate on what these issues are, or provide evidence that these issues actually exist. you could argue that a family car, a refrigerator, or even the house itself keeps a household together. these are all technology. by your argument, these would all be problematic for some mysterious and unstated reason. \n\nyour other example: \n&gt;'shop by shouting a phrase at a robot, no need to go out' \n\nthis is equally presumptuous and ill-defined. firstly, you haven't actually stated why 'not going out' is a bad thing. maybe it lets me have more time to relax at home instead of standing in line at the market, which is definitely a positive outcome for me. secondly, you assume that not shopping equals not going out, which is plainly not true. maybe with the time that i save by not going to the store, i go out and do something else instead, like see a movie, hang out with friends, or go hiking. here, your argument is based on unfounded assumptions and cannot support your claim. \n\nwhen you say 'reliance on technology' what you seem to really mean is that 'we are too reliant on some particular technologies like smartphones and the internet, but it's ok to be reliant on other technologies like electricity and modern food production.' you have picked some arbitrary limit on technological advancement, for example 2006 (just before smartphones) or 1985 (just before popular consumer internet) and have decided that that's the right amount of technology to be reliant on. however, you still haven't provided any convincing arguments as to why that particular level of technology is the right one. \n\n&gt; In a world full of constant updates and fast information, why should we access things in any other way?\n\nindeed, why? you're claiming that making things slower and more difficult would be better. it's your job to answer this question. \n\nReason 3: Invasion of Privacy\n\nyes, this may be a legitimate concern generally. however, it is true of many technologies aside from echo. you have not argued sufficiently that echo is worse in this regard, or provided any actual evidence that privacy has been invaded. the potential for harm to occur is not the same as harm actually occurring. if we banned technology based on the potential for harm, we'd have to ban basically everything: kitchen knives, leather belts, baseball bats, you get the idea.\n\nin summation, i have shown that your position on this issue is flawed in specific and demonstrable ways. you cannot make the claim you're making without updating or revising your position, and therefore must change your view. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses stylistically, we can observe the following:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** Maintains a more neutral, analytical tone, attempting to clarify the original poster's (OP's) concerns while also presenting rebuttals.

I am not a believer of any after life or supernatural.  If after death we experience what we experienced before birth which is nothingness, then isnt life meaningless?  Why should we continue to suffer when life is literally a constant suffering?  I personally believe life is meaningless.  When you are under the assumption that you experience nothingness when you are dead, what is the point of living?  \nThe only reason I can personally see for living is to not inflict additional emotional suffering on those that you know and care about you.  But if you do experience nothingness after life then why should it matter when you wont be able to conceive of this suffering.\nIts been something I've been thinking a lot about lately...

{"index": 359, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: 51 \"New\" Gender Options are Over-the-Top and Useless.\n\nOriginal Post: \nAwhile ago, Facebook released several new genders - many of them seemed to come out of nowhere and almost all are incredibly confusing, over-the-top, and redundant. To preface this, I am *not* against anyone in the LGBT community and welcome the idea of gay marriage and things similar. However, I've never really been on-board with all these new genders. \n\nAnyway, some of the terms that come to mind are *Agender* and *Androgynous*. The mean the same thing, to not identify as any gender, so why are they two separate words? *Genderfluid* and *Bigender* seem completely redundant too - so, why even have them? I'm also not entirely sure why people can't just dress the way they want to while remaining whatever sex they were given at birth. \n\nDoes it really matter if a man dresses as a woman? Does he really have to be classified as *gender-fluid* because it really just seems like a word that would be less blunt than *cross-dressing*. Again, I have nothing against that, but it seems like people are trying to make other words to someone glorify what they're doing.\n\nAlso, what's the deal with \"cis\"?\n\n* Cis-female.\n* Cis-male.\n* Cis-man.\n* Cis-woman.\n* Cisgender.\n\nIf the definition of \"cis\" is basically people acting within the confines of their gender, why can't they *just* be called women and men? Why do they have to have a special name? Considering that people are giving away names to things that already exist, it seems really indicative of how strong other words in their dictionary are (see: gender-fluid and bi-gender redundancy).\n\nAgain, I can't stress this enough, I have no issues with people being who they want to be and how they want to be that. It just seems overly unnecessary to have a million new Facebook gender options for things that clearly overlap each-other. A lot of this also seems more of a ploy for attention, not someone *actually* identifying as something.\n\nWith that being said, am I just seeing this the wrong way? I get incredibly annoyed when someone tells me they're \"gender-fluid\" or \"cis-female\". It makes me believe that I may be seeing this the wrong way - or maybe these terms really are inessential and pointless?\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

So the language is still evolving, and similar people end up identifying with different words - but it would be kind of cruel to say to someone, \"you might identify as genderless, but agender is the official term so you have to call yourself agender\" So facebook errs in favor of inclusion (though technically I think you can put literally anything now? you can just write in what you want, I put 'person' for mine)\n\nSecond Response: \n(Disclaimer: I'm of a binary gender, so some of the things I'm saying may be incorrect)\n\nYou're right in that there is some overlap between a lot of these terms, but there's also a large amount of difference (similar to how girl, woman and female all overlap in definition but are all distinct terms with differences between them)\n\nI'm gonna use a couple different words than you might have heard before. Gender identity: the gender a person identified as. Gender expression: all those external cues you use to determine someone's gender: their hair or clothing or jewelry, posture and the like\n\nAs for the genders you listed, my understanding of them is that being bigender is a matter of identifying as two genders (usually taken to be man and woman) simultaneously. A bigender friend of mine would always feel weird when asked to choose man or woman, as their gender identity was as both.\n\nMeanwhile genderfluid is more like a third gender that isn't man or woman or anything else, but whose gender expression often fits in with depictions of other genders. A genderfluid friend of mine always feels weird when asked to choose man or woman because they identify as neither. \n\nA similar thing occurs with genderqueer, which often forms a third gender with your traditional non-gendered displays and presentations. Genderqueer and genderfluid overlap a lot and are really close, but it generally sounds to me like genderqueer is like one gender whereas fluid is more fuzzy and, well, fluid and variable.\n\nI've never heard of anyone identifying as androgynous, I usually only see that as a descriptor that someone uses for their gender expression that's still different from their gender identity. Agender, meanwhile, is a term I've usually heard more as an identity than an expression.\n\nEssentially, a lot of the terms do overlap a lot, but they do mean different things and meanings and thus can better identify certain people. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the thoroughness and depth of explanation offered in the Second Response.

Tranquilizer guns also have a very low rate of fire, very low ammunition capacity, and much lower range and accuracy than conventional firearms. Guns are just better suited to the task.\n\nSecond Response: \nHave you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. \n\nI'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.\n\nAlso, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system.

{"index": 362, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: As a Vietnamese, sometimes I wish the America won the Vietnam War\n\nOriginal Post: \nLook, I know this is a touchy subject, and while people might say I'm young and didn't understand the complexity of wars, just hear me out.  \n  \nVietnam was essentially a communist state, due to influences from China and USSR, which were alliances (the former is debatable) of Vietnam during the war. After the war, our country has suffered multiple economic depressions, and famines due to the incompetence of our liberally named Communist Party. Granted the South Vietnam government wasn't any better, but what the U.S wanted for Vietnam was for the best.  \n  \nI understand that, technically the US did not wage war with our people, but stood against the spread of communism in Asia, and with our strategic location, a battle surely followed. The US did not deliberately invaded our country. And look at what they did to the world. ~~Defeated the Nazis and fascist countries~~, uplifted South Korea, Japan (which were both smaller and less resourceful than my country) to their respectable position on the world map today. And what had the sole communist party in my country done? Nothing but left our people in the struggle of a third-world country. And China is still brazenly harassing our borders and seas to this very day, just because our army is incapable of standing up for themselves.  \n  \n~~Please tell me if I was wrong and why the North won was a good idea.~~  \n  \nEdit: My view has changed. It was not simple as I thought it was. Generally it can be summarized into those points: involvement of China, motives and war crimes committed by the US, and there was no hope in the governing system. Communism has not helped our people a bit, but no one can really advocates for America either. We as a nation should look to develop our own path. Insights are still very much appreciated. And thanks for the discussions.\n\nFirst Response: \nThe North winning is by far the best scenario for the vietnam war. \n\nThe reason for this is because you fail to factor in China. China was ballsy enough to invade an independent Vietnam that was allied with the USSR after the war. You would be crazy to think that they would allow a territoy close to their South to fall to another enemy. \n\nIf the South started winning and legitimately invaded the North, China would most likely allow North Vietnam's leadership to die off and they would install their own leaders and probably destroy the South. I see no reason they wouldnt do this and America would be insane to intervene. The Vietnam war had relatively low casualties for the US side(even so there were protests around the US with millions of people yelling for peace), increasing that by a factor of 10 for a third world country would not do. So basically a Chinese Vietnam which would probably look like North Korea/khmer Rouge.\n\nAnd in the impossible scenario where the South wins with No Chinese/Soviet intervention then Vietnam would be the same/worse. It was horribly corrupt under the South leadership(main reason so many southerners supported the North, mainly farmers but still). When the people are united and dont see ideologies as enemies but instead their fellow citizens that oppress them. Then there will be more war. This Vietnam would most likely follow the path of Iraq.\n\nThe last scenario is the US intervenes. I will not add nukes(also it's boring) because it is MAD in that scenario because both China and US had nukes. China stomps the US out of Southeast Asia easily. American public wouldnt have the stomach to lose 300k+ soldiers for an impossible war. If the US intervenes anyway then they lose hundreds of thousands of soldiers and experience an economic fall the likes of which it has never seen before. The Soviet Union has a field day and expands elsewhere like Philippines/Indonesia/Africa with almost 0 intervention. \n\nSecond Response: \nI have nothing but admiration for the Vietnamese people. Within a span of 30 years the French were expelled, the United States was stopped from partitioning or exerting control over the country, and shortly thereafter a Chinese invasion was repelled. The Vietnamese also deposed the Khmer Rogue in Cambodia, a regime responsible for massacring millions of people.\n\nUnderstandably, you look to countries that have done well out of being within the US sphere of influence, like South Korea. Remember though that the Rhee regime, which was supported by the US during the Korean war, was also responsible for massacring 100's of thousands of civilians. At the time, alignment with the great power that would exert the least influence over Vietnam (the Soviet Union) was likely the best option.\n\nYour people have a heroic history and you should be proud of it.\n\n\"\"The last time the Chinese came, they stayed a thousand years. The French are foreigners. They are weak. Colonialism is dying. The white man is finished in Asia. But if the Chinese stay now, they will never go. As for me, I prefer to sniff French shit for five years than to eat Chinese shit for the rest of my life.\" \u2014 Ho Chi Minh, 1946\n\nThe same thing would have happened if Vietnam was partitioned or fell within the US sphere of influence.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are rooted in the tone, emotional approach, and engagement strategies employed in the responses. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a tone of admiration and respect towards the Vietnamese people's history and struggles.

The vast majority of rapes occur in the home of the victim or the rapist, and the rapist is someone that the victim knows and trusts. Here's the sad truth - if you are a woman, statistically, you are more likely to be raped by your dad than a stranger in the bushes. \n\nIf you really want to prevent rape, you need to focus on the vast majority of rapes. So that to me would mean things like bystander intervention, where you emphasize the need for bystanders to step in and seperate someone from a situation they think could be inappropriate, teaching about rape and sexual violence during sex Ed so people grow up understanding what the signs of an abusive relationship looks like and how to get out. Also so that people learn that sexual violence is not the victims fault and what steps to take if they want to report to the police. So many people are afriad to come forward and the recidivism rate for sex crimes is so high it's this horrible cycle of serial rapists who don't ever get punished and people keep getting victimized. Also there needs to be more education on consent, not only to teach what consent is, but to help empower young girl to feel comfortable saying no and that they don't have to do anything sexually that they don't want to. A lot of us get the message that we should just go along with whatever the guy wants even if we don't want that, which opens us up to predators who take advantage of that situation.  Anyways, my point is there are a lot of more effective things we could be doing besides telling people to be afriad of the dark, which people naturally are anyways btw.\n\nSecond Response: \nI'm going to reverse the genders. \n\nHow would you feel if you were told [this is how men should act to avoid false-rape accusations](https://i.imgur.com/7LXtLB5.jpg) ?\n\nYou would find it absurd. You would say it's absolutely stupid to adapt to a Dystopian society instead of trying to improve this society.\n\nMany people have this misconception that rapes only happen to attractive and sexy dressed women in dark alleys. This is a cliche conveyed by Hollywood.\n\nRape doesn't necessarily comes from strangers, and it also doesn't only happen to women who dress up sexy. Many rapists do it more because of  domination/power/humiliation reasons than because the victim is visually attractive to them.\n\nThis means that when you start of the path of victim blaming, there is simply no limit because there is no point where women will be safe. It starts with asking people to dress differently and hang out in safe places, and it ends up with asking women to stay at home and cover themselves entirely.\n\nSecond thing is: women are *already* taking precautions, and they do NOT need a guide to know what to do. What they don't want is for the medias to present the rape situation as something women are partly responsible of. \n\nThere are already too many people who still don't admit that rape is rape in some situations... and you want to perpetuate the idea that this is true? Your solution wouldn't make things better (as I said, women already know what to do), it would only make things worse.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses to the original post, several stylistic elements stand out that contribute to each response's effectiveness in potentially changing the original poster's view.\n\n### Comparison of Responses\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- **First Response:** The tone is empathetic and authoritative. The responder shares personal experience both as an advocate and a survivor, which grounds their argument in real-world impact and fosters trust. The emotion is aimed at drawing attention to the complexity of the issues surrounding sexual assault and emphasizes a proactive, educational approach.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is confrontational and provocative. By reversing genders and presenting a hypothetical situation, the responder seeks to challenge the original poster's views directly. However, this tone may come across as dismissive of the original poster's feelings, which can alienate rather than engage.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- **First Response:** The use of statistics (i.e., most rapes occur at home), along with personal anecdotes and solutions, creates a well-rounded argument. This establishes credibility and makes the response relatable. Moreover, it focuses on broader societal solutions rather than placing the onus all on potential victims.\n- **Second Response:** The hypothetical scenario serves to highlight absurdity, which can be effective in raising awareness but may come off as reductive. Additionally, the mention of misconceptions and stereotypes about rape invites the reader to reconsider prevalent narratives, yet it does not provide as many actionable solutions.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- **First Response:** This response is structured logically with clear, concise sentences that flow well together. Ideas build on one another, leading to a natural progression towards educational solutions.\n- **Second Response:** The sentence structure is more fragmented and may cause the reader to pause, potentially detracting from the seriousness of the points made. While the engagement is forceful, at times it may lead to confusion rather than clarity.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- **First Response:** The responder directly addresses aspects of the original post, providing counterarguments that not only challenge the original view but add depth by proposing alternatives. There\u2019s an underlying current of encouraging discussion, which aligns with CMV's aims.\n- **Second Response:** While engaging through hypothetical situations, the second response may feel less inviting due to its more combative style. This can discourage further dialogue from the original poster.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n### Key Factors\nThe first response is more successful in changing the original poster's view due to its empathetic tone, authoritative voice backed by personal experience, logical structure, and constructive engagement. It presents a nuanced discussion that respects the complexity of the issue and suggests actionable solutions rather than merely refuting the original points. This approach likely resonates more deeply with the original poster, allowing for a greater chance of perspective change.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 364, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Animals that attack hikers in national parks should not be put down\n\nOriginal Post: \nEvery month or so, we hear about a tragic story of a hiker attacked by an animal (usually a bear) while they are out in the wild. Often times, the animal is unprovoked. But sometimes an animal's instincts will overtake it, and it will perceive a hiker as a potential threat to either it or its offspring. Whenever an attack on a human happens, park officials from wherever the incident occurred place traps to catch and euthanize the animal.\n\nI don't think that animals that attack hikers should be killed. I love the National Park System, and everything they do, but I just don't think that it is appropriate. The NPS was created for the purpose of being preserved. With that preservation comes the opportunity for us as humans to enjoy them in their uttermost beauty, but that doesn't mean we should start altering them for our convenience. \n\nYes, wild bears can be dangerous. They're BEARS for heaven's sake! But their habitat isn't ours to make our own. Part of hiking through these parks, whether it's the Great Smoky Mountains (where the North America's largest density of black bears reside) or Yellowstone National Park (where a grizzly killed a hiker just yesterday), wild animals are going to be wild. \n\nThe national parks are to be preserved, not to be altered for our enjoyment.\n\nFirst Response: \nIt's not a matter of justice or what's right. The fact is that we value the life of a human over the life of an animal. When an animal attacks, even if provoked, there is a significant chance that it will attack again. The risk of someone else being harmed or killed is too great to favour the life of that animal.\n\nIf you disagree with this concept, as is your right, you may also want to reconsider where the meat you buy comes from or how the milk you put in your cereal is collected (assuming you are not already a vegan)\n\nSecond Response: \nI see your point, but animals that attack humans aren't put down for justice or vengeance. An animal that attacks a human is very likely to do it again, so they're killed for the safety of any other humans who they come across. It's sad, but the alternative is the possibility of things like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champawat_Tiger) happening again.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the tone and emotional approach of each response, as well as their engagement with the original poster. The second response maintains a respectful tone acknowledging the original poster's viewpoint while introducing the necessity of human safety as a pragmatic counterpoint. It avoids confrontational language and suggests understanding of the emotional weight surrounding the issue, which helps in creating a dialogue rather than a debate.\n\nIn contrast, the first response takes a more accusatory tone by stating that valuing a human life over an animal's life is an inherent bias. This might trigger defensiveness in the original poster rather than prompting them to reconsider their stance. The second response also provides a relevant historical example, making a persuasive argument grounded in real-world consequences, which could resonate more deeply with the original poster compared to the first response's more abstract moral reasoning. Overall, the second response exhibits a more effective style of engagement that likely has a greater capacity to shift the original poster\u2019s perspective.", "is_correct": false}

I am a native English speaker, and I agree that it is not the best language for international business use, but it is not something we can just change. It rose to power when the US spearheaded the growth of global economy. The organic nature of things like the languages people choose make it difficult to change.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;I understand that the conjugation is the only tough part and the whole gender thing might be confusing at first (not that crazy if it ends on an a it's female, except agua which can be both, the only tough part is if it end on an e).... I know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were.\n\nYou are.  Because it's your mother tongue, you're minimizing the particular difficulties it has, while highlighting the difficulties of other languages.  \n\nIn truth, very very few people are in a position to trust their feelings as to how 'easy' a language is.  \n\n&gt;English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise.\n\nYou're sort of minimizing this part as well.  It isn't as though there's an official ruling board that's selected English, and all you need to do is change that committee's mind and everything will start working out.  \n\nIt's more of an organic, self-reinforcing system, one that includes lots of choices besides trade agreements;  American (and to some extent, British) movies, television, and music simply command more presence on the world stage.  While it is true that I've seen a fair amount of foreign (subtitled) movies that got distributed to theaters here in America, it isn't anywhere near parity with the number of American movies that get widespread global distribution.  \n\nBecause so many other people have already learned English as a second language, there's more value in additional people learning English as their second language.  In terms of communicating with people you're likely to be in a position to want to communicate with, English has a lot in its favor.\n\nThere is certainly a case to be made that there are better choices if everyone agreed to ignore those factors.  See Esperanto.  But those other factors are a large way to explaining why Esperanto hasn't really been successful, and I'm not sure Spanish is leaps and bounds better in those regards.  \n\n&gt;Also the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by this.\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - The **First Response** adopts a calmer, more analytical tone.

This tone may foster a sense of understanding.\n   - The **Second Response** has a more confrontational tone, directly challenging the original poster's views.

Here are a few of the many to wear one:\n\n**They reduce the extent of any injuries caused by a bike accident**\n\nBike helmets are proven to make any injuries obtained greatly decreased. The effectiveness of helmets are found to be 85-88% in preventing serious injury. About 70-80% of accidents involve some damage to the head. It is estimated that if children ages 5-15 were forced to wear a helmet, 39,000 to 45,000 head injuries would be avoided, along with 18,000-55,000 face and scalp injuries. I could go on and on with these, but I don't have that much time. If you want more proof, just google \"bike helmet facts\".

Still good stuff on this page, though)\n\n**Helmets do not interfere with riding the bike.**\n\nHelmets, if they are the correct size, do not get in the way while riding the bike. The only thing they can do is possibly disturb the airflow, but special aerodynamic helmets are made for this, if that is that big of a deal to a person. \n\nCommon Counterarguments:\n\n**It messes up my hair!/It is uncomfortable!/It makes me look like a dork!**\n\nI always hear this, but, you know what, none of these are that big of a deal! I would much rather endure a little discomfort than get a possibly permanent injury to my head.\n\n**But I haven't fallen off my bike in, like, years!**\n\nThis one. I hate when people say this. Just because you haven't gotten in a crash in a while does not mean that you are exempt from ever crashing again. This is especially true when travelling on a main road when other cars are a factor.\n\n**They're so expensive!!**\n\nNo, just no. An average bike helmet will cost about 10 bucks or less. If you can afford a bike, then you can afford a helmet\n\nAlright, that's it for now. Please CMV! \n\nEdit: My view has been changed.

Yes, there is an increased risk of people getting hurt in a bicycle accident, but there is also a decrease in things like heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.\n\nIt turns out that cities without helmet laws tend to have much bigger adoption of bike riders and bike sharing programs.

I also don't think it is strictly the language being used. Regardless of the label, not wanting your partner to have been with 5+ people is 100% defensible. If we, as a society, can tell people that being tall is attractive or that being fat is unattractive, we can tell being that sleeping around is unattractive.     \n\nAnother logically invalid argument is that the person with the preference, must not be promiscuous themselves. I think this is as non-nonsensical as telling a man he can only be attracted to men, otherwise he's hypocritical. My choice in partner is independent of my partner's choice in me, we can like different things. Many physically fit men are \"chubby-chasers\" and man slutty men are virginal chasers. \n\n\nEdit: To clarify, the use of the words \"slut\" earlier was merely a reflection of the term as it has been used on Reddit.

The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    \n\n(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the \"sound-bit culture\" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   \n\nSpecifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically \"Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad.\" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    \n\nTo me, the fact that this \"quotable\" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    \n\nWe (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Only the rich and most power hungry. By saying everybody ought to speak perfectly all the time we are selecting the most out of touch people to be fun our government. It's really concerning actually.\n\nSecond Response: \nMany of the problems we face today (institutional racism is a good example, but so are climate change, income inequality, and partisan gridlock) are extraordinarily complex in their causes.  Any meaningful discourse about real, workable solutions to these complex problems will necessarily need descriptions that defy brief, quotable sound bytes.  You say \"a good candidate is one who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context\"-- in other words, you are asking for a candidate whose speeches consist only of empty platitudes, and ignore all issues that are sufficiently complex as to require some \"setup lines\" in order to explain.  \n\n\nWhile it is true that the media prefers to focus on out-of-context sound-bytes (because this allows them to engage in low-effort, high-reward \"gaffe journalism\"), we the American people should push back on this tendency if we are ever to have any hope of a public discourse that is actually constructive.  You may be so cynical as to believe that no politician will ever be willing to take up these problems meaningfully; nonetheless, that's how our system is designed, and if they don't, no one else can.  Part of our responsibility as citizens is to demand accountability not just from our elected officials, but from the news media who cover them.  The Internet has actually revolutionized fact-checking, and made it very difficult for erroneous or misleading news stories like the one you describe to survive very long before being called out.  This, in my opinion, is a good thing for democracy.\n\n\nAs a final note, I want to make a particular comment on your statement that \"we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.\"  I'm not sure who the \"we\" in this statement is meant to refer to, but the [news media has a famously frosty relationship with the Clintons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/10/after-two-decades-of-hostility-can-hillary-clinton-change-the-dynamic-between-her-and-the-press/) and certainly is not looking to do Hillary any favors if they can help it.  \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "The first response adopts a tone that is more defensive and somewhat cynical about the political landscape. It suggests that the constant scrutiny and expectation for perfection in speech will deter qualified individuals from entering politics, which can be seen as a deeply emotional yet critical stance on the consequences of today's media environment. The sentence structure is straightforward, focusing on clear, strong arguments, but it lacks complexity.\n\nIn contrast, the second response employs a more analytical and constructive tone. It engages with the original poster's argument in a thoughtful manner, taking time to break down core concepts such as the complexity of societal issues and the nuances in political discourse. It uses rhetorical techniques like hypothetical questions (\"Who are the types of people that have no skeletons in their closet?\") to provoke thought and encourage reflection. Additionally, the response is longer and more complex in sentence structure, aiding readability in a more sophisticated manner.\n\nThe second response actively addresses the original poster's opinions and challenges them by expanding the conversation beyond just Clinton to the broader implications for democracy and politics, while also emphasizing accountability for both candidates and the media. This level of engagement shows an effort to understand the original poster's motives while also guiding them toward a more nuanced perspective.\n\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to this prediction is the analytical nature of the second response.

Seems the only shoe that's off the list is a pair of stark black oxfords, but even then, I don't know. Hipsters like Apple products, but also love old technology! Their hobbies are anything outdoorsy or creative, except when they aren't I.E video games. They embrace both irony and sincerity ect., ect.,ect. It just seems like a strawman built up to shun anyone doing anything or acting in a certain way that you don't like. It also seems to be that the thing everyone hates about hipsters is their attitude, but deep down, it's an attitude anyone can have. It's an attitude of snobbishness and inauthenticity.

It's like somebody peopled a neighborhood with stereotypes. \n\nSecond Response: \n\"Hipster\" is a derogatory term used to insult people from a certain broad counter-culture.  The problem is the perceived smugness of that counter-culture.  That is why people ascribe the \"you probably haven't heard of it\" catchphrase to hipsters, because of a supposed pride in being outside the mainstream.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "The two responses to the original post display notable stylistic differences that likely influenced their effectiveness in changing the original poster's view.\n\n**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - The **First Response** adopts a slightly conversational and lighthearted tone. Phrases like \"it's like somebody peopled a neighborhood with stereotypes\" inject humor, which can engage readers positively.\n   - The **Second Response** carries a more serious tone, emphasizing the negative implications of the hipster label by focusing on perceived smugness. This approach can provoke a defensive reaction rather than inviting consideration.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - The **First Response** uses a rhetorical strategy that draws from evidence (mentioning a \"well written explanation\") to support its points. The reference to Williamsburg as a stereotype-laden area allows the respondent to paint a vivid picture, enhancing relatability.\n   - The **Second Response** primarily presents an argument against the term \"hipster\" without engaging in broader examples or narratives. It comes off as an assertion without backing it up with specific examples.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - The **First Response** employs a mix of short and long sentences, maintaining reader interest and flow. The language is accessible, making it easy to digest.\n   - The **Second Response** tends to use longer, more complex sentences. This can lead to a decrease in readability and make it less approachable for readers seeking clarity.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n   - The **First Response** acknowledges the original post by referencing the shared understanding of hipster culture. The mention of a known neighborhood aligns the response with the poster's experience and makes it feel more like a dialogue.\n   - The **Second Response** is somewhat more aloof, primarily stating an interpretation of hipsters without directly engaging with the original post's argument.

I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.\n\nPlease change my view.\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt; I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.\n\nVaccines are one of the single greatest medical interventions that human beings have ever developed. I guess you know where I stand. This anti-vax hullabaloo is a bunch of nonsense, and is only present in developed countries. Parents have forgotten what Polio and Rubella do to children, or they wouldn't be so cocksure when denying their children vaccinations. I really don't care how someone raises their child (religion, homeschooling, etc.) but not vaccinating them is plain stupidity. Not malice, just ignorance.\n\nIf you want, I can debunk just about any conspiracy theory you could bring up regarding vaccines, but I don't think it'll be necessary. I'll just deal with the most pernicious point first, ask me for more if you need to. \n\nOne of the biggest reasons for this panic is because people think that vaccines cause autism. They don't. The Lancet paper that started that has been thoroughly debunked. In the meantime, there have been multiple controlled studies that have demonstrated that there is no link b/w vaccines and autism: [Study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003140) and [an overview with even more available studies](http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p4026.pdf)\n\nSecond Response: \nWhat are the main heath concerns that you have with vaccines? Are they worse than the potential medical issues that could arise from people not being vaccinated?\n\nAside from that, there are some people who can't get vaccinated because of certain medical issues. These people rely on heard immunity to protect themselves from the diseases that vaccinations are supposed to prevent. If more people who can get vaccinated don't, it puts those who can't get vaccinated at a greater risk to develop some of the issues that vaccines can prevent. If everyone who can get vaccinated does, it makes it much less likely that these medical issues develop on a large scale. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include the tone and emotional engagement of the responses. The second response takes a more inquisitive and empathetic approach by asking the original poster about their specific concerns, which fosters a sense of dialogue and understanding. This technique establishes a rapport that encourages the original poster to articulate their views and consider alternative perspectives. The focus on vulnerable populations and the mention of herd immunity adds a layer of ethical responsibility, appealing to the original poster's sense of community and public health.\n\nIn contrast, while the first response provides a strong stance against vaccine conspiracy theories, its tone leans toward confrontation and dismissal of the original poster's doubts without inviting further discourse.

Whatsoever. I wanna change that.\n\nThere is \"intrinsic\" meaning to life. Your experience and internal meta-narrative are what will determine what kind of conclusions you come to about life. If you do meditate, you can often get a clearer idea of this. Some ideas are \"sticky\" while others are not. Try not to prefer one over the other, and you'll find the need for \"meaning\" to fade away. \n\nI don't know whether I was helpful.

Life may seem POINTLESS, that's fair, we don't know the deeper meaning or if there is one. But worth means that the pleasure you can get is worth the shit you have to go through. If you're depressed, you might say life's not worth living. If you're happy and doing fun stuff and basically living a hedonist lifestyle, you can enjoy it. I believe you're making the point that life seems \"pointless\" rather than \"worthless.\" \n\nI think you're basically saying that since we all die eventually, and if there's no afterlife then it seems pointless to live in the first place. It's like drinking and having a great night partying but you don't remember in the morning: what's the point?\n\nThis is also relevant... As I said I don't believe in free will but I do believe that the purpose of the universe is for life. It's an expanded-on deistic perspective. So I also encountered this paradox dealing with free will; if free will doesn't exist, and every thought and action we have is scientifically predetermined, then isn't that a paradox? I recently discovered this one spiritualist viewpoint that actually solves this paradox, and it is the most logical religious/spiritualist philosophy I've ever come across.

I believe that anyone of any size can be *healthier* at that size. If I start jogging once a week, I probably won't lose weight, but I'll be a teeny-tiny bit healthier and that's good. \n\nSecondly, BMI is an overall population indicator. There are of course given people who are overweight who are healthier than given people who are within normal range. Same goes for given people who are underweight vs people in normal range. However, I would state that *in general*, the further you slide on the scale from 22.5 in either direction, the further you're getting from optimal.\n\nHowever, wherever people lie on that scale - underweight -&gt; optimal -&gt; fat is none of your fucking business whatsoever.\n\nYou are not a stakeholder in a stranger's health and people would do well to keep their mouths shut about other people's appearance. If you *are*  stakeholder in their health (and this is exclusively limited to loved ones and the person's healthcare practitioners) then maybe you get to say something. *Maybe*.\n\nThe best analogy for this is smoking. I smoke and am slightly overweight (~10lb) and it is certainly the smoking that is more detrimental to my health than the few extra pounds.\n\nI *know* that smoking is bad for me - I'm not an idiot. I view the HAES as a bit like \"Healthy No Matter How Much You Smoke\". It's not true, it may even be damaging. On the other hand, encouraging hardened smokers to run around despite being smokers ain't a bad thing. Attack the campaign, if you must, but leave the people alone.\n\nIt does not matter how many people tell me that smoking is bad for me.

If people in your society are overweight, you'll have to contribute more money and effort to cover the cost of their choices.

It emphasizes a logical argument and does not use emotional appeals. The rhetoric is more about economic consequences than personal morality, which might feel less confrontational.\n- **Second Response:** This response conveys a slightly more assertive tone, presenting the argument as an unavoidable fact of life. It maintains a subtle level of emotional urgency by stating that the financial impact of others\u2019 health choices directly impacts everyone. The reference to political philosophers adds a weighty quality, suggesting that this issue deserves serious consideration.\n\n#### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response:** Uses a direct questioning approach by asking the original poster to define \"stakeholder.\" It builds on this definition to rationalize a position that intertwines personal choices with financial implications for society. The use of \"you\" draws a direct line to the poster, enhancing engagement.\n- **Second Response:** Utilizes a broader stroke by linking the individual\u2019s health directly to societal costs and personal financial burden. The reference to historical philosophical debates privileges the argument with intellectual depth, suggesting a long-standing complexity in the issue. It also expands the argument's scope beyond obesity, invoking other societal issues to reinforce commonality.\n\n#### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response:** The sentences are clear, though somewhat long and complex. This may require readers to engage more carefully to follow the logic. The readability is good, but the argument may seem tedious to some due to its length.\n- **Second Response:** Slightly easier to read, with a more varied sentence structure that balances brevity and clarity. The flow allows for easier consumption of the argument, making it appealing and engaging for a broader audience.\n\n#### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response:** Directly addresses the original poster\u2019s argument by acknowledging their point of view before introducing its counterargument. This approach opens the door for dialogue, suggesting that the responder respects the original opinion while providing a counterpoint.\n- **Second Response:** While it presents an alternative point of view, it does not explicitly engage with the original poster's thoughts or acknowledge their concerns. Although it presents a valid argument, it lacks the direct conversational quality that might encourage further discussion.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n### Explanation\nThe key factor in predicting the success of the first response lies in its engagement tactics.

{"index": 374, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Coffee is overrated, the effects received are negligible and often a placebo, and people who say they like the taste are lying to themselves.\n\nOriginal Post: \nI understand the philosophy behind acquiring tastes (learned to love San Pellegrino), but I cannot for the life of me truly find myself appreciating coffee like many of my friends do.\n\nEvery child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.\n\nI consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.\n\nThe extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.\n\nIt seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nCould that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? Has my past experienced not done justice to an entire culture that is coffee? I mean people spend hundreds of dollars a year on it, and for what?\nChange my view.\n\n\n\n_____\n\nFirst Response: \nOn top of what's already been said, the reason why 'espresso connoisseurs' hate Starbucks is because they burn their beans (over-roast them) which produces a strong bitter taste, and then they overload it with sugar to mask the bitter taste. This is fine if you don't like the taste of espresso\n\nStarbucks is like it's own subdivision of espresso centered a bit more around the sugar. And that's fine, and clearly tons of people enjoy it enough to make it the large enterprise it is. But the people who've had and loved actual espresso, and learned to enjoy the taste of it, will be shocked upon trying Starbucks to find that the espresso part of the drink tastes like shit, and there's way too much sugar. It'd be like enjoying fine local craft beers all your life, then being thrown a Bud Lite. Sure, Bud Lite is popular, but it doesn't have what someone who enjoys craft beer is looking for. Or lets say you grew up having fresh, delicious hamburgers from the cows on your farm along with fries from potatoes you grew at home, then you had a McDonalds Big Mac. Shit, I love myself the occasional McDonalds, but it scratches an entirely different itch than homemade hamburgers and fries.\n\nI know I'm sounding pretentious. I really have no problem with Starbucks. Just trying to explain.\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI love coffee. If given the choice, I'll have freshly roasted beans that I just ground made in a very particular way that takes me about 3 minutes/cup. This is one of my favorite parts of my day- although, admittedly, partly because I enjoy the ritual behind it. However, I enjoy most coffee- I will even enjoy a cup of Starbucks brewed coffee. I love, love, love to drink it and have enjoyed it since I was very young. However, I guess you can just tell me \"you are lying to yourself\" and I guess there is no way to address that. But I will address a few things you said:\n\n&gt;Every child growing up seems to desire coffee, but only because it's age restricted, similar to alcohol/tobacco. \n\nSo are you saying that this is the only reason people enjoy alcohol and tobacco? By this logic, do people not really enjoy adult movies, sex, or driving? After all, those are all things that are age restricted as children and that children wouldn't really enjoy anyways. Why is coffee different than them?\n\n&gt;Could that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee? \n\nIf what you say is true, probably. A frappe at Starbucks doesn't count. So your only experience is instant coffee and specialty house coffee.\n\nInstant coffee is only real coffee in the way that tang is real orange juice. It tastes sort of like coffee and gives some of the benefits, but it isn't actually coffee. If someone who had only ever had tang said \"I don't like orange juice,\" you would probably say \"you have no idea if you like orange juice- you've never tried it.\" I would say the same thing about instant coffee. Go out and have some real coffee before you judge the beverage.\n\nI have no idea about the shops you have been to. But many of those specialty coffee shops serve very strong, sour, and bitter coffee. Which is great if you are into it, but is a poor introduction to coffee. They are the equivalent to blue cheese. If someone had only ever had blue cheese before and said based on it \"I hate cheese,\" you would probably say \"you should try something milder before making up your mind.\" I would say the same thing about coffee: if you have only tried strong specialty coffee, go try some milder coffee before you make a judgement.\n\nSo, go try some real-but-mild coffee. A light roast at Starbucks would actually be a decent one to try. Then make a judgement. You may still not like it yourself, which is find. But even if you don't like it, you probably won't find it as gross as the fake stuff or the super strong stuff. It should help you wrap your head around why some people like it.\n\n&gt;It seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. \n\nThere are two reasons some don't think Starbucks is real coffee. First, because most of what they sell isn't actually coffee. The Frappe you order is a great example- I love them, I really do. But it is closer to a milkshake than a coffee. \n\nSecond, many don't like the decision they make with their brewed coffee and espresso (ie: real coffee). Starbucks is kind of like McDonalds- consistency is more important than quality. They want you to experience the exact same taste every time you go in. They aren't as bad now, but they still do it to a degree- they burn their beans. This gets rid of a lot of the flavour profile in them. This has the plus of making every batch of beans taste the same, it has the downside of taking out a lot of the nuance. Personally this doesn't make me hate Starbucks coffee. It just makes me not enjoy it as much as I would other coffees. It's kind of the difference between having a marinara sauce that came out of a jar and a marinara sauce that someone home cooked all day- the first one will be fine, but not nearly as delicious as the home made variety.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response is more likely to have changed the original poster's view due to its empathetic and engaging tone.

{"index": 376, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I believe that socialism is fundamentally better than capitalism\n\nOriginal Post: \nFor the purpose of this post, I am defining \"capitalism\" as a relatively free market system, with private ownership of the means of production. \"Socialism\" is defined as a system in which the government owns the means of production, and distributes all things necessary for decent quality of life (food, water, shelter, education, health care, etc) for free to all minors and any adult either working, seeking work, or enrolled in school. I understand that this definition is more specific than the true definition of socialism, but I want to preempt any arguments suggesting that people won't look for work if everything is provided for them anyway; they won't be provided for unless they contribute. Also, please note that I am not advocating any specific system of governance; I don't want a debate about the merits of direct democracy. Assume that the system of governance is something effective and relatively democratic, unless there is a compelling reason why my definition of socialism ensures ineffective government.\n\nWith that out of the way, here is my justification. I believe that capitalism ensures exploitation of the lower-classes. The winners in a capitalist system are nearly always those who were born into relative wealth already. Even the rags-to-riches stories of our time, such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, they were all born into at least lower-middle class. Those trapped in poverty are normal people, who usually work much harder than the people at the top, and get nothing for it. I don't mean to put down high-ranking executives, or other wealthy individuals, but I think that if capitalism is designed to benefit those who work hard, it's doing a shoddy job. Look at all the people in America, one of the world's wealthiest countries, who have to work two or three jobs to stay afloat, through no mistake or irresponsibility of their own. It's just not fair.\n\nAnd that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair. Global capitalism causes enormous waste, while billions starve. Cyclical poverty disproportionately affects minority citizens within the US, and non-European cultures around the world, proving the system is not only oppressive of impoverished people, but also a system of racial oppression.\n\nNot only is it bad for people, but I believe capitalism is also bad for the environment. The reason for this is that there is no real profit motivation for companies to try to help the environment. Sure, a corporation can get a few extra sales by slapping a \"Green!\" or \"Eco-Friendly\" sticker on their product, but there is no incentive for corporations to do anything but the very minimum for the environment. Government regulations help, but they only go so far, and are difficult to enforce when companies can simply relocate their factories to places with less stringent regulations (and often less worker-protection, to boot). \n\nSo, with those reasons put out for why capitalism is bad, here's why I think socialism is better. Socialism prevents needless death and suffering by ensuring that everyone who contributes gets everything they need for a healthy life. Socialism ends cyclical poverty by giving everyone a chance at education, without worries about putting food on the table. Socialism is better for rewarding the hard-workers and punishing the slackers, because without unfair head starts going to rich kids entering the workforce, the real cream will rise to the top (there would be variable wages and such; the government employers could offer raises and promotions to their best workers). Socialism is better for the environment, because the government could have direct control, and would have much more incentive to manage the environment in sustainable ways than short-term-minded corporations.\n\nI guess I can go further in depth in my replies, if needed. I'm looking for a good debate, and maybe a change of heart. Change my view!\n\nEDIT: OK all, so I have been persuaded by a combination of factors that socialism as I define it is not as good as capitalism with generous welfare policies and heavy regulations (think Nordic model). I'll be giving out deltas now. I will continue debating as well, but I think I'm done for now. I will resume later. \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There are so many loop-holes that closing all of them is nearly impossible without imposing unreasonable regulations on what is an acceptable life-style. \n\nI could easily enroll in a low-tier community college, pick low-work major, sign up for the minimum hours to be a full-time student, and pass all my classes without attending them and with no more than an hour or two or work a week. I could probably do this for 8 years before I graduated. Meanwhile, I could sit and browse reddit all day. Should I be getting all your socialist benefits?\n\nAlternatively, suppose I want to go into some exotic profession like streaming video games. There are hundreds of people out there that end up making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year by streaming because they have built up a viewer-base of tens of thousands of people. But to get that viewerbase, you need to constantly be producing content, and the process of acquiring viewers is very slow and it took ages for many of the popular streamers to get above a dozen people tuning in. How do you differentiate between someone who sits and plays video games all day verses the next pro-gamer that will entertain a hundred thousand viewers a day?\n\nWhat if I want to go out and make the new app that sells millions of copies? How long can I come out with unsuccessful flappy-birds until your system stops supporting me?\n\nAnd about that person seeking work... they have a nice resume, went and got themselves a good degree, have some experience, but no one is hiring them. Their personality is simply terrible and no one wants to work with them. Then what? \n\nI do not believe that socialism is fundamentally wrong, but you can't just provide everyone's basic needs if they are \"productive members of society\" without some serious problems arising. \n\nPeople are very much inherently lazy and many already do the minimum they need to not get fired. When you give them a socialist safety blanket, they will continue to do the minimum they need to keep it. If you want to advocate such an extreme form of socialism (what you suggested is much more extreme than what any socialist country right now has), your system is doomed to fail until you find some way of closing pretty much every loophole of how you trick the system. How do you hope to do that?\n\nSecond Response: \n*Note: I don't have a lot of information on your whole post, but on the economics side.\n\n&gt;And that's the real problem with capitalism; it isn't fair.

It's just not fair.\n\nTo those people I say what job are they working?

{"index": 377, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Sword Art Online is one of the best Anime of All Time [SPOILERS]\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've recently subscribed to r/anime, and as a long time anime watcher and considering myself to have the appropriate amount of good taste, I feel that Sword Art Online is massively misrepresented as mediocre among fellow fans and otakus. Currently ranked [#459 on MAL](http://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online), this show scores an average rating of only 8 out of 10 nerd points.\n\nI believe this is due primarily to *hater votes*. It should be in the top 50, if not top 25, anime of all time.\n\nIn fairness to the haters, the ALO arcs sort of ruined it with the whole sister romance harem thing. Japanese people are weird, but they sure know how to milk a hit show. For that reason, SAO II is not considered here; just vanilla SAO please!\n\nSome Background\n\n---\n\nI am a 30-year old male product writer for the web, and I am not what most would consider an otaku or weeabo. (I prefer Korean culture, if we're comparing asking, and I don't go to cons, collect or read much Manga, or follow every anime series.) I watch anime recreationally, and consider myself a reasonable self-styled critic. I've recently watched quite a number of shows, being bored at home, and I've watched and rewatched SAO several times and am familiar with it.\n\n\n---\n\n**Why The Show Is Good**\n\nCharacters: The cast is great. Voice acting isn't overdone or underdone, and the characters all feel like people from a real world stuck in a game for a long time together. It also makes sense that they're all there.\n\nPlot: The premise is not made of solid gold, but it's interesting enough to lend itself to greatness. If you die in the game, you die for real no quitsies. This has been done before in fiction, of course. However, SAO takes a different treatment of this premise. Normally, you would see horror, like in a show like Gantz, applied, or game aspects, such as in No Game No Life. \n\nSAO's goal is rather to show that a virtual world can be real and fulfilling. Its creators accomplish this by focusing not on the MMO aspects, which are limited to flavor, but rather on the interaction between strong characters and the tension of being trapped within this scary world. The story itself lends itself to a rich world, and the writers take advantage of the larger arc to fit in almost a dozen sub-arcs in 24 episodes. The show is *very* story dense for an anime; normally, a single sub-arc would take 4-6 episodes. These sub-arcs balance developing the world, fighting, and building relationships. The characters build on their strengths and flaws and often find themselves in situations partially crafted of their own making. (Example; Asuna is hard on her guild and pushy, and this results in a poor culture within the guild that causes problems as the series develops.) There are no unbelievable moments.\n\nIn the end, the heroes triumph, but it's not a boring triumph. They often sacrifice during the show and make many mistakes that weigh upon them. At the ending bar scene, you can feel the air of both relief and regret washing over all of the former players.\n\nAt the symbolic level, SAO is very symbolic of life itself. God puts us on this plant, and we don't get to leave unless we die. So we adapt to it and live in it, the same as in SAO's virtual world. This allegoric story pairs well with the show's many slice-of-life scenes, creating a very vibrant and real-seeming virtual world.\n\n**Writing:** SAO does not waste time or words. No episode is filler, and each main character is multi-dimensional and arrives naturally in the main story arc. Characters do not break character. Villains are villains. Episodes are succinct and *excellently paced.* This show is so clean that you can eat off of it.\n\n**Art:** The art direction is superb. Each character's outfit is suitable for their personality and status. Motion and combat is more fluid and direct as well as it was in Fate: UBW and other highly regarded similar shows. It was smoother than classic epics like Record of Lodoss War and Gurren Lagann or modern releases like Arslan. Admittedly, it probably had a bigger budget than those shows, but that shouldn't be a detracting factor at all. The only *fantasy world* anime I would give a higher regard to in art direction is Berserk, but in quality of animation, SAO crushes Berserk.\n\nThe only complaint you could make in the art department is that the show wasn't stylized enough to differentiate it from other fantasy anime.  For instance, the art direction in Kill la Kill was an incredible thematic rush of color with awesome hand-painted backgrounds. I'll grant that point, but can you name a fantasy anime with a better quality of animation offhand?\n\n**Avoids Most Awful Anime Pitfalls:** Fanservice, chibi conversations, people falling off of park benches or turning into paper; these are the marks of an anime breaking the fourth wall and ruining suspension of disbelief for the view. In short, they're signs that an anime doesn't take itself seriously. Almost no anime of any level of notoriety, excluding comedies, uses these generic tactics.\n\n---\n\n**Arguments Against**\n\n&gt; Overpowered Main Character\n\nThe story follows Kirito, a regular guy with some Kendo training and beta test experience in an online game. Kirito earns almost all of his levels solo and is on par with the very best fighters in the game. He starts off with an advantage due to his experience, gets full exp. for the very first boss, and grinds pretty much every day from there on out to stay on top of the curve. He clearly earns his main character slot through a number of trials instead of being handed it by the divine will of the writers, such as in every other anime ever. He is given a unique skill, eventually, which is powerful, but it's relatively balanced because it's difficult to use. His backstory and skillset are reasonable, and given that there must be a \"best\" among all the players, it makes sense that the show would follow him.\n\nMeanwhile, in How to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon, the main character is literally given a skill that says \"become overpowered against things you can't beat.\" It's shit like that which makes me want to throw my laptop.\n\n&gt; Dumb Plot Moments\n\nIn the first or second episode, another beta tester dies in Kirito's arms not because he was defeated, but because he turned down a potion. That guy was obviously a fuckin' idiot, and that scene could have been saved if he had just drank up and laid there. This is a fair criticism. Additionally, the army guild unit that marches in to fight the minotaur boss half dead is also made of retards. However, it's noted in the show that the reason they do this is because the army has been terrorizing its members. However, those deaths serve a purpose within the show and are not overtly distracting. The dumb beta guy's death serves to inspire Kirito to action and turns him into the MC. The dumb army guys are, much like the group that runs into the trap room early in the series, there to set Kirito on the right path and force him into action.\n\nIn the meantime, how will you excuse characters like Faye Valentine in one of your favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop? She's just there to be a plot instigator with a pair of giant boobs. Almost. Entirely. Fanservice. Many other very good anime have done much much worse with their cast and still rank top 50. Hell, Hajime no Ippo is fan ranked 20 on MAL, and although I won't disagree that the show is awesome, it's just following the formula of a hundred other sports anime shows like Prince of Tennis. OWARI NO SERAPH is even up there, and that show literally only has one redeeming character -- who isn't in most episodes. Hell, characters are invented out of thin air and people do dumb shit in Game of Thrones every other episode. Are you really going to say that SAO's weak point is a few serviceable plot blunders and side characters that didn't think through some obvious mistakes?\n\n&gt; You didn't like the ending\n\nThe ending probably irked a few of people because it was so sudden. However, that's really the magic of the series. It's a virtual world controlled by a nutty, manipulative scientist-god whose purposes are unknown. That's the driving mystery behind every episode. Why are they even there? Why is the NPC planted in the guild as the final boss? Why is the psychologist AI disabled?\n\nWithout that underlying tension, the series doesn't take shape. The story is about human actors making intense decisions, and the elusive creator adds another layer to the conflict. It makes the story feel bigger than it is and every victory seem hollow. This in turn allows our main characters to keep driving forward.\n\nPlus, they've already put in so many boss fights. I thought the defeat of the technically invincible guild leader was an awesome way to end, although it's obviously hedging a sequel.\n\nI'm tired of typing, so I won't bore you with more examples. Although I really wish they had done much more with the sequels, I believe the original series ranks among the best-produced, best scripted, cleanest, most heartfelt Anime of all time. I look forward to your spirited replies.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Any questions or concerns?

Great fight scenes, good music, good production values. A good popcorn show but it doesn't do anything really unique or really make you think. Doesn't make it a bad show but it certainly isn't some unparalleled masterpiece. \n\n\n\nKirito is what drags the show down in my opinion. He is such a boring, lazy, utter wish-fulfillment character. He has virtually no flaws and can easily overcome every situation he's in whether it's because he's a really high level player or through sheer plot device 'power of the human spirit' bullshit as in the fight with the game's programmer. He's a super-cool 'lone wolf' badass, but also a super nice guy who will go out of his way to help people, and also every girl he meets will almost inexplicably fall in love him just by being in his presence and regardless of how kickass they were before they all go weak in the knees and suddenly can't do anything without their fucking boyfriend. \n\n\n\nIt's not a bad show in my opinion, but it doesn't do anything that spectacular. Setting the 'golden oldies' aside, I'd say a much better candidate for one of the best anime ever would be *Baccano!* There's a show that stands out with an interesting premise and a fantastic execution that makes it a goddamn masterpiece of storytelling.\n\nSecond Response: \nI thought SAO was fairly enjoyable and I quite liked the first 3 or so episodes, but \"one of the best of all time\" is a high bar to set.  So I'll add to your arguments against to explain why I think the story is weak (I'd do a con of your writing pro but my issue has nothing to do with the pacing).\n\nEssentially pretty much every piece of major plot tension is resolved simply through Deus Ex Machina (sometimes literally), random powerups, or just magic \"power of friendship / love\" nonsense.  Nothing really feels like it is resolved by the characters, it's always some weak plot device.\n\n* Boss fight giving them trouble? Oh Kirito will just pull out a random sword move that has never before been seen.  With a skill set that was literally handed to him by the machine.\n\n* Confronted by player killers? Ha, of course Kirito is literally immune to any danger they pose.\n\n* Kirito paralyzed? Oh look Asuna, magically appears out of nowhere just in time.\n\n* Boss monster even Kirito can't defeat? Good thing the daughter that showed up the previous episode is an immortal object.\n\n* Oh no, Yui is being deleted?  Don't worry, Kirito can instantly \"hack the gibson\" on a terminal he just found out existed 30 seconds ago to save her as an in-game item.\n\n* Kirito losing the final duel? Asuna magically breaks the paralysis.  (Even the BBG notes how silly this is.)\n\n* Kirito goes on to lose the final duel? Eh, no matter, he can phase back in and get one last jab in, which happens to completely drain the BBG's health despite the long established damage rules.\n\n* Oh but Kirito lost Asuna?  No worries, she alone gets to be the only non-clearing player to be defeated but not executed by the NerveGear.\n\nIt's a long list for a run of just 25 episodes, and it burns out all the tension in the story.  Basically, nothing after \"The Red-Nosed Reindeer\" can get the viewer excited because *of course* some random thing is going to happen to save the day.  The end result is that even the ending duel, in which the viewer sees the two main characters *die* is ruined because by that point the viewer should know deep down that *of course* some random bs is going to win the day.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Upon analyzing the two responses to the original post, both responses share a considerable overlap in their perspectives, but differ in tone, emotional engagement, and rhetorical techniques.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response**: This response adopts a somewhat dismissive tone towards Sword Art Online (SAO), referring to Kirito as a \"boring, lazy, utter wish-fulfillment character.\" The emotional stance is critical, expressing dissatisfaction with character development and story execution, which may alienate the original poster who is passionately supportive of SAO.\n- **Second Response**: In contrast, this response maintains a more analytical approach, acknowledging enjoyment of the earlier episodes but ultimately setting a high bar for the title of \"best anime of all time.\" It presents its critiques in a structured manner, presenting logical arguments that criticize the use of plot devices like Deus Ex Machina, hence keeping the discourse somewhat more respectful and constructive.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response**: The use of informal language and hyperbolic expressions (e.g., \u201cpower of the human spirit bullshit\u201d) establishes a casual yet confrontational approach, potentially creating defensiveness in the original poster. There is less backing for claims, as the critique relies heavily on subjective interpretation of character flaws.\n- **Second Response**: This response employs a methodical breakdown of specific plot developments that undermine tension, elaborating on the issues by citing examples, which provides a solid foundation for its argument. This structured critique coupled with an acknowledgment of enjoying the initial episodes engages the original poster directly by recognizing their viewpoint.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\nBoth responses demonstrate clear readability, but there is a distinction in how information is presented. \n- **First Response**: The sentences are shorter and more direct, aiming for quick impact with fewer examples providing context.\n- **Second Response**: This response utilizes longer, more complex sentences that link ideas effectively, giving a sense of thoroughness to the critique.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response**: This response engages less with the original post's arguments and focuses more on a singular critique of Kirito, which may not resonate with the original poster who supports multiple aspects of the show.\n- **Second Response**: By engaging with the original poster\u2019s arguments directly, pointing out specific criticisms of the show's plot resolution while maintaining a respectful tone, the second response fosters a constructive dialogue that could appeal to someone with differing views.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation\nThe primary factor influencing my prediction is the second response's structured arguments and its more respectful tone towards the original poster's views. By recognizing some enjoyment of the early episodes while thoughtfully critiquing the reasons SAO may not reach \"best of all time\" status, this response opens up a dialogue rather than simply dismissing the original poster\u2019s enthusiasm. This approach is more likely to encourage the original poster to reconsider their views on the show's merits and flaws, making it a more effective response in terms of changing perspectives.", "is_correct": true}

Plenty of people can pass tests, go through courses, etc and still have issues down the line. All that initial training and testing is to weed out people who are obviously not qualified and ensure there are standards of basic knowledge/skills employees possess to do the job properly. Judging someone solely on such a short sighted and narrow view of their qualifications is simply not smart decision making, especially when others people's lives are at stake. \n\nAnd your definition of \"mentally ill\" simply isn't well developed enough to really be able to change your view on the issue. What disorders are you including? How can you make a meaningful statement about how violent they are if you are lumping a bunch of disorders together? Why are you only considering rate of violence when plenty of other issues that mental disorders could bring about would effect job performance.\n\nAlso you need to realize that we are not all equal from a performance standpoint. In the real world, we have different abilities to handle stress, perform under time constraints, etc. The issue is not whether someone can pass a test or qualification on a single day, it is can they repeat the same task everyday with little to no error. Someone with a mental illness may have more variation in performance because it is simply another variable taking away from one's ability to do a stressful job well. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nWell, I can see that, but in the case of police officers, what if the mental illness was one in which the person would be unable to make a rational split-second decision? Realistically, these are people who have stressful jobs and they don't know when or if they're going to face a violent criminal who might have a deadly weapon when they go to work every day and of course they're going to make the occasional mistake as it is. I think you mentioned training in other replies, but eventually the man with a mental illness is going to run up across a situation that hasn't been covered in training and that's when he might have a meltdown.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response adopts a more analytical and reasoned tone, focusing on logic and critical thinking. This provides a more stable foundation for changing someone's mind, as it invites the original poster to reconsider their viewpoints based on facts rather than fear or hypothetical scenarios.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response utilizes analytical reasoning and questions aimed at getting the original poster to think deeper about their definitions and beliefs, which can lead to self-reflection. It challenges the original poster's premise by expressing that the definition of \"mentally ill\" is too vague, pushing for a more nuanced understanding of mental health issues. In contrast, the second response relies more on hypothetical scenarios, which may evoke fear and resistance rather than a change in perspective.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response uses clear, straightforward sentence structures that are easy to follow. This enhances the likelihood that the original poster will engage with and understand the points being made. The second response, while also reasonably clear, introduces more complex scenarios that may divert from a focused discussion and lead to emotional reactions.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response directly addresses aspects of the original poster's argument and lays out a framework for discussion about mental illness and job performance in a rational manner. Conversely, the second response centers on a speculative concern (the police officer's meltdown), which may not resonate as strongly or offer an opportunity for constructive dialogue.\n\nOverall, the first response is more strategically engaging and seeks to reformulate the original poster's viewpoint through careful questioning and reasoning, making it more likely to effectively change the original poster's view.", "is_correct": true}

A lot of his jokes/gaffes/mannerisms are genuinely funny even out of the context of the show. I think a lot of people would love to have a fun/goofy boss like him. I'm not even sure if the writers wanted to go for a realistic portrayal of office life, or write all the characters to dislike Michael for comedic effect. For example, I just recently saw an episode where he creates an orientation video for the new employees after the merger (Season 3, Episode 8 \"The Merger\") and the video is downright HILARIOUS, yet one of the employees straight up says he doesn't find it funny and questions wether it was even intended to be funny. I don't see this as even remotely realistic. \n\nEdit: Additionally, a lot of the things he does that seems to offend or anger characters are done because he genuinely believes what he is doing is right or is the nice thing to do. He clearly loves the office, its employees, and his job and many of the things he does are simply to help his employees. CMV\n\nFirst Response: \nMost employees might like Michael, yet his good guy personality would lead to employees taking advantage of him to the point that he would be demoted or fired.\n\nThe best kind of boss treats people as fairly as they can, is understanding, has a sense of humor, is firm and loves to go for long walks on the beach.\n\nSecond Response: \nWhat about Toby? Michael relentlessly targets a single employee, simply because that employee is trying to do their job properly. He genuinely treats Toby in a cruel way; he is abusive. He has tried to get Toby fired, and constantly belittles him - and all this, just because Toby is responsible for health &amp; safety.

The second responder uses specific examples from the show to highlight a serious flaw in Michael Scott's character, contrasting humor with the negative consequences of his behavior. This approach not only presents a logical argument but also evokes an emotional response by discussing the impact of Michael's actions on Toby, thereby inviting the original poster to reconsider their stance. The tone is serious and direct, which effectively counters the lighter, more whimsical portrayal in the original post.\n\nIn contrast, the first response maintains a relatively light tone and makes a broad argument about the challenges of Michael's personality. While it mentions a potential downside to Michael's character, it lacks the specific, compelling examples that characterize the second response.

I hope it's a fabulous experience for you.\n\n&gt;But I have a fear myself of being falsely accused, or accused in a case where consent is retroactively removed. I don't think of this potential as being very high; I don't think most women are that vindictive; however in the event that it occurs it seems the results can be devastating.\n\nIt would be a very scary situation.  As would hundreds of other situations that might occur.  The constant in all those situations would be you.   Remember, fears are internal things.  Therefore, should be dealt with internally.  That is, instead of worrying about what a partner might potentially do, make sure you are confident in what you do. \n\nNothing wrong with telling a partner(s) that you have this concern too.  Discuss it with them.  Your feelings are valid, your concern exists.  How your partner(s) react to this disclosure might help you decide if they are a good choice.  Might sooth your fears.  There is a lot of power in communication. \n\n&gt; I don't think I'm of the party that has difficulty understanding consent\n\nKnowing it's an issue of consent is no small thing.  Get familiar with the language, and comfortable using it when applicable.  Use more communication instead of less.  Don't assume your partners know much about consent, actually have the talks.  \n\nWhether you want a plethora of sexual partners or a single monogamous honey, you can learn by and teach each other better communication (not just about consent) which will directly reduce the possibility of any ... misunderstandings, or hook ups with unstable people.  \n\nAlso, I want to point out that you are not immune to sexual assault because you are a young man.  Read the stats below with the understanding that some of those (90% +) unreported assault victims are men.  \n\nAs you make friends, and lovers, have each others backs.  Learn how to keep each other safe and do so.  Don't settle for hook-ups with people you don't trust, or friends who don't respect you or others.  Make friends with both genders and have everyone's back.  Don't fall into that us vs. them fear baiting malarkey. You're stepping off into your future. Make it, and the relationships in it as positive and unlikely to have issues as possible.  \n\n**some stats: **\n\nAccording to the [National Sexual Violence Resource Center](http://www.nsvrc.org/sites/default/files/publications_nsvrc_factsheet_media-packet_statistics-about-sexual-violence_0.pdf)\n\n&gt;**Campus Sexual assault**\n* One in 5 women and one in 16 men are sexually\nassaulted while in college (i).\n* More than 90% of sexual assault victims on college\ncampuses do not report the assault (c)\n* 63.3% of men at one university who self-reported\nacts qualifying as rape or attempted rape admitted\nto committing repeat rapes (j)\n\n\n&gt;**Crime reports**\n* Rape is the most under-reported crime; 63% of\nsexual assaults are not reported to police (o).\nOnly 12% of child sexual abuse is reported to the\nauthorities (g).\n* The prevalence of false reporting is between\n2% and 10%. For example, a study of eight U.S.\ncommunities, which included 2,059 cases of sexual\nassault, found a 7.1% rate of false reports (k).\nA study of 136 sexual assault cases in Boston found\na 5.9% rate of false reports (j).

[Only 2-8 percent]( http://web.stanford.edu/group/maan/cgi-bin/?page_id=297) of rape accusations are false. Which, to put it in perspective, is the same rate of false accusations for other felonies.

In searching for critiques of those statistics I found [this article](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/02/defensive-gun-ownership-gary-kleck-response-115082.html#.Vdm1n_lVhBc) that lays out some criticisms of the first article's source study, along with a rebuttal from another journalist who's written on the topic.*\n\nI believe that:\n\n1. You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.\n\n2. Therefore, if your goal is to make yourself and/or your family safer, then choosing to keep a gun in your home explicitly for that purpose is an irrational decision.\n\n\nI do believe there is one exception to this. If you have a particular reason or belief that you are likely to be attacked, then, since the odds of being attacked have increased dramatically, then it may be rational to have a gun in the house for self-defense. For example, if you have a stalker. If you have received threats on your life. If you have any reasonable belief that someone will try to harm you specifically. If government or police forces have broken down. Basically, if the odds change so that for you the risk of you or your family being attacked is greater than the risk of having a gun in the house, then it would be rational to have a gun.\n\nBut we do know, statistically, on average, that is not the case. So for the average person, the risks are such that the rational decision for maximizing safety is to not keep a gun.\n\nI further believe that if you get other uses out of the gun other than just self-defense, then the other added benefits of having a gun would make it rational to keep one in the house. For example, if somebody was a hunter and or target shooter and they get a lot of joy out of their hobby, that could be worth the risk of gun ownership. Or even if someone cited tradition, or the need of an armed populace as a check on the government, that too could be a perceived benefit to them that makes the safety risk worthwhile. I'm strictly speaking about what's the best decision for maximizing personal and family safety.\n\nChange my view by showing me that the risk of harm to you or your family is lower by having a fire arm in the house.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

While having a gun for protection is certainly not a rational choice for most Americans, it is a rational for some Americans. For instance, individuals in extremely rural areas. Living in rural Alaska with access to a firearm for bear protection in certain areas is highly advisable. While it is certainly irrational for most folks to have guns for home protection, the argument that it is always irrational is too broad in scope. \n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;You, or someone in your family, are more likely to be killed by your gun either purposefully or accidentally than you are to use the gun against an attacker successfully in self-defense.\n\nThis is a poor argument because the survey makes no attempt to differentiate between knowledgeable, responsible gun owners and people who don't pay attention to safety protocols or know how to properly use their gun. When accidental shootings or unnecessary violence happens it is because of ignorance and poor decision making, not because of the gun. The solution is education and ensuring that gun owners *know proper safety etiquette* before allowing them to purchase a firearm, not discouraging their ownership entirely.\n\nAs a parallel, [driving is statistically much more dangerous than biking everywhere](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9729218/Driving-is-five-times-more-dangerous-than-cycling-for-young-men.html). Is car ownership \"irrational\" for this reason? No, because it isn't the cars that are dangerous, its the people who drive them badly. Like with gun ownership, any responsible, decently educated driver can be confident that they won't instigate any sort of accident. \n\nIt's entirely rational to own either guns or cars if you take the precautions to ensure they're not misused.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - The **First Response** adopts a neutral and slightly defensive tone.

The response seems respectful but not emotionally charged.\n   - The **Second Response** takes a more confrontational approach, directly challenging the original poster's argument about the risks associated with gun ownership. It emphasizes responsibility and education over outright discouragement, which could imply a stronger emotional investment in the topic.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - The **First Response** uses a personal anecdote about rural living as a rhetorical device to suggest that context matters.

{"index": 383, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:The fact that the English has lacked a language regulator over the last few centuries has been a detriment to its beauty and ease of learning\n\nOriginal Post: \nI recently discovered /r/Anglish.  Anglish is an attempt to construct a version of English using only Anglo-Saxon and other Germanic roots.  The result is a language that not only sounds beautiful, but is much more intuitive to learn new vocabulary.\n\nTake, for example, this [list of lores](http://anglish.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Lores).  Rather than using Greek-derived names for the sciences, which are completely meaningless to the average learner of English until they learn the name of that particular science, Anglish uses simple compounds from common, everyday words that language learners would already be familiar with.  Many languages do this as well.\n\nThe result of incorporating all these foreign words is that English no consistency of grammar, spelling, pronunciation, or anything.  This makes it more confusing and burdensome to learn.\n\nI should specify that I'm speaking of a regulator with the goal of keeping English clear, consistent, and true to its roots.  Obviously, a language regulator that pushed for the inclusion of these foreign words would be no help.\n\nIt may be too late now, given the use of English as an international language, but I think it is a shame and a detriment to international communication that English wasn't standardized this way a long time ago.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We don't just borrow words; on occasion, English has pursued other languages down alleyways to beat them unconscious and riffle their pockets for new vocabulary.\" ** -- [James Nicoll ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Nicoll)\n\nFrench, as you pointed out, has a language regulator with the power to decide what is and is not proper French. There are roughly 77 million native French speakers in the world. By comparison, English, which has no such authoritative regulator, has about 400 million speakers. It is the language of [business](https://hbr.org/2012/05/global-business-speaks-english), the [language](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29543708) of [science](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2015/01/english_is_the_language_of_science_u_s_dominance_means_other_scientists.html), even the language of international [air travel](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/761307/English-to-become-compulsory-for-pilots.html). It is overall seen as the [dominant](http://www.cepr.org/PRESS/DP2055PR.htm) international language today: where a Belgian and an Argentinian may not speak each other's native language, there is a reasonable chance they both speak English, and so has a great deal of utility. At best, French is maintained as the language of [diplomacy](http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2013/04/languages-diplomacy) but even that is starting to be supplanted by [English](http://www.legallanguage.com/legal-articles/language-of-diplomacy/), which makes sense considering that more people know English by many, many degrees. Ironically enough, French is no longer the lingua franca in much of the world. \n\nWhy is this? Partially, it can be explained by the political dominance of, first, the British Empire and, immediately after, the American Empire. But another reason is that, contrary to your assertion, its willingness to absorb the words of other languages makes it easier to pick up and use by non-native speakers. French, and other linguistically purist cultures, take a protectionist approach to their language, carefully pruning it to make sure it grows only in the way they want it to grow. By contrast, English takes a more free market approach, where words can easily cross borders and be changed to suit the needs of whomever uses them--if French is a carefully pruned topiary, English is an all-devouring kudzu vine. While a topiary certainly looks better, and may be less bothersome, none can argue that it grows faster, and requires less maintenance, than kudzu. This, in fact, is criticized as [linguistic imperialism. ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_imperialism) Whether or not one agrees that the spread of English is a good thing, none can deny that this is indeed happening on a mass scale. \n\nThis makes intuitive sense: a language that can be easily adapted and modified and changed will spread more quickly than a language that cannot, because ultimately languages are utilitarian creatures. People learn them to use them, and if a language is more difficult to use, then it will be more difficult (and less appealing) to learn. English readily accepts loan words. French, official \"proper\" French (not speaking of colloquial French here), does not. English is simply a more hospitable environment for foreign words, and this has in turn made English more attractive. If we think of it in terms of nations, all other things being equal, which country will have more immigrants: one with an open door policy and a speedy path to citizenship, or one with a highly restrictive immigration policy with an exhaustive and lengthy path to citizenship? \n\nSo, contrary to your view, English's lack of regulation has actually made it *easier* to learn, not harder. The trouble people have when learning English usually has to do mainly with the grammar structure than the vocabulary. This is a good problem to have, because a vocabulary mistake can be easily corrected, while a grammatical mistake (we're talking big ones, like wrong word order, versus ending sentences with prepositions) cripples understanding. Further, while this is highly subjective (but then again, so is your point), I believe that English's willingness to change and adopt foreign words as its own (and adopt and change foreign words too) makes it very beautiful. There are concepts that simply cannot be expressed with English words on hand, and so it's quite useful to be able to simply take another word to fill in the gap, and so thereby increase the language's range of expression. If we were only restricted to Anglo-Saxon derived words, the things we could communicate would, I believe, contract significantly. \n\nUpon further thought, I also find it odd you would single out English for having inconsistencies in grammar, spelling, pronunciation and more--every language has weird things about it that can confound even native speakers. This even includes French. Much of this inconsistency comes from colloquial usage and geographic diversity. Sure, it's weird that some people insist on calling \"soda\" \"pop\" instead, but I don't think the country needs to settle on one definitive word to use for \"sugary, fizzy beverage.\" \n\nUltimately, to trap the English language in amber like some Jurassic-era mosquito is to remove the vitality, dynamism, adaptability and diversity that makes it such a strong language in the first place. This does mean, of course, that the English of today won't be the English of 100 years from now, just as it's not the English of 100 years ago, but that's a feature, not a bug. A language that cannot, will not, adapt will find itself to be like a highly specialized organism that does extremely well for its niche but is unable to adjust to changing circumstance--and those organisms tend to go extinct much faster. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI think that you underestimate the influence that romance languages had on English as it was developing, and I would argue that it is an equally important component . For English to go back to its \"roots\" where only Anglo-Saxon counts, you would need to COMPLETELY restructure the language to something incomprehensible to modern English speakers. You would essentially be creating an entirely new language. \n\nThe concept of language regulators is a relatively new concept that developed during colonial times. In fact, the oldest thing that resembles a current language regulator is the Oxford ENGLISH Dictionary. This was created long after Old Norman had entered the picture. It should also be noted that a lot of the major differences in American and British spelling and pronunciation came about when organizations tried to codify the language, as you are suggesting we do.\n\nAs a bookkeeper, I think it is wrong to imply that English does not create words using simple concepts. I also think it is wrong to suggest that creating words out of simple concepts would streamline English or make it easier to understand. A bookkeeper could also be a librarian or a bookstore owner using your version of English. On /r/Anglish they give kangaroo as an example, explaining that \"leapdeer\" could be an alternative, but what would call gazelle, or impala, or antelopes? They are all types of deer that have a penchant for leaping. Anglish may have worked 1300 years ago when the world was a much simpler place, but English has evolved with the times to describe the ever-expanding universe.\n\nFrom what I can tell, most contemporary Germanic languages use variations of the greek words to describe sciences. So English is not alone in that change. I also find the concept of calling Geology \"Earthlore\" upsetting. As lore in contemporary English has the connotation of being fictitious, and the only people who view Geology as fictitious are creationists! \n\nOn a personal level, the reasons you give for wanting a language regulator are the reasons I love English. English is not pretentious, it is not caught up in maintaining itself or its purity. I like that we argue over the Oxford comma and the pronunciation of gif (HARD G). That we add selfie to the dictionary and that we don't call tacos \"stuffed flat bread\". If a language already has a word for something we just take it as is (minus some bastardization for pronunciation purposes) and add it to the dictionary. If it doesn't have a word for it and move on. I like that we do not have an official body that is fretting over whether outside influences are destroying our language and culture. At its core English is a language of inclusion, adaptation, and growth. What you see as a detriment to the language, I see as a benefit. Since English is such a vast and chaotic language non-native speakers can get away with a lot more and we'll still understand them.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "In comparing the two responses to the original post about the English language and the lack of a language regulator, let's look at several key stylistic elements.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n\n- **First Response**: The tone here is more combative and sarcastic from the outset, starting with a reference that both challenges the original poster's view and incorporates humor by likening the English language's purity to that of a \"cribhouse whore.\" This could engage readers who appreciate bold and edgy expressions. The emotional appeal is rooted in a defense of English as a dynamic, global language, appealing to a sense of pride in its flexibility.\n  \n- **Second Response**: The tone is analytical and reasoned. While it disagrees with the original poster, it avoids sharp sarcasm and focuses instead on elaborating points clearly with a sense of respect for the original post's ideas. This response adopts a more personal view towards the end, evoking emotional engagement by reminiscing about the fun and quirks of the English language.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n\n- **First Response**: This response employs humor, metaphors (the English language as a \"kudzu vine\"), and comparisons (to French as a \"topiary\"), which make the argument memorable. It builds on an image of English as an adaptive, evolving organism, emphasizing the benefits of its lack of regulation through a series of vivid analogies.\n\n- **Second Response**: Here, the response relies on factual occurrences (language evolution and history) and logic rather than humor. It presents examples and analogies related to the complexity of language evolution and the practicality of English as a language of adaptation. The appeal is more intellectual and concerned with the implications of regulation on the very identity of the language.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n\n- **First Response**: The structure is varied and complex, with a number of long sentences that include multiple ideas. The use of footnotes and links also adds depth, but could lead to a dip in readability for some. The complex constructs may appeal to readers who enjoy a deeper exploration of ideas but could confuse others.\n\n- **Second Response**: The structure is mostly straightforward, with a focus on clarity. This makes it accessible and easier to digest. Shorter sentences are balanced with longer explanatory ones, improving overall readability.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n\n- **First Response**: This response actively engages the original poster\u2019s arguments but often does so through critique, targeting points made directly. The sarcasm may lead to defensiveness rather than opening a constructive dialogue.\n\n- **Second Response**: The second response acknowledges the original post's perspective, presenting counterarguments in a respectful manner. It explicitly indicates areas of disagreement, while also sharing personal opinions about language, which may resonate more with the original poster.\n\n### Prediction\n\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Key Factors for Prediction\n\nThe second response successfully engages the original poster's perspective with detailed, respectful counterpoints, while acknowledging the complexity of the topic. This approach is likely to invite the original poster to reconsider their stance, as it creates a dialogue and offers a personal connection. The first response, while vivid and attention-grabbing, may alienate the original poster with its confrontational and sarcastic tone, which could close off the possibility for change in viewpoint.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 384, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The United States lags behind other nations because of its size and heterogeneity\n\nOriginal Post: \nHello CMV,\n\nAs I'm sure many of you know, there have been a number of reports and studies that bring to light the lackluster ranking of the United States in comparison to other nations in categories such as [infrastructure](http://www.statista.com/statistics/264753/ranking-of-countries-according-to-the-general-quality-of-infrastructure/), [poverty rates](http://www.epi.org/publication/ib339-us-poverty-higher-safety-net-weaker/), [education](http://thelearningcurve.pearson.com/index/index-ranking), and so on. Usually, these show other nations, typically Scandinavian and other European countries, consistently coming out on top. \n\nThis leads to a somewhat negative and unhealthy perception of America for both citizens and non-citizens that I think is unfair. This is because, in my view, there are 3 factors which hinder America's ability to keep up with its developed nation counter parts:\n\n* Land Size\n* Population\n* Cultural Heterogeneity \n\nFirst, here is a top 5 list of the largest nations on Earth by square mileage, in order from largest to smallest:\n\n* Russia\n* Canada\n* China\n* United States\n* Brazil \n\nThe US is the 4th largest country on the planet, and as such, I think its ability to manage and update infrastructure is limited. A bullet train similar to those in Europe would be difficult in the US. Also, land from coast to coast is extremely diverse, ranging from plains, to mountains, to desert, to swamps, and so forth. Such a diverse biome requires diverse management of resources and is pretty difficult in my opinion. \n\nNow here's a top 5 list of countries by population, from largest to smallest:\n\n* China\n* India\n* United States \n* Indonesia \n* Brazil \n\nNot only is America massive in terms of land area, it has a massive population as well. This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems. (This is not to say America *wisely* spends its money on its people, but that is a separate argument for another day). And yet compared to the other 4 most populous nations, it still maintains a high standard of living, relatively low poverty rate, and economic mobility. \n\nThe only other country that hangs with America in *both* categories is China, which is massive in size and population. But America differs from China in one way, which is my third point -- a heterogeneous culture. \n\nThe US was founded by immigrants, as a nation of immigrants, and diversity is only growing into the future. America features such a mixing pot of ethnicity and culture that it makes it difficult to enact programs that benefit everyone equally. I think this is most evident in education, where the US has the difficult task of creating a system that benefits *every* child in the best way possible. In China, a largely homogeneous population with high value on education *should* produce high results. \n\nAnd yet, despite having all three of these factors to consider, the United States is ranked [5th on the Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) as late as 2014.\n\nSo, basically my argument is this -- The United States, being huge in size, huge in population, and having a heterogeneous culture, is at an instant disadvantage in comparison to other nations, and is doing pretty well for itself all things considered. \n\nCMV! \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The United States spans two oceans, which makes it virtually invincible to any serious threat of outside invasion. If the United States was merely one of multiple tiny countries, like in Europe, it's geographic integrity would be less secure.\n\nAdditionally, it's huge size is responsible for the USA having access to a tremendous amount of natural resources. The USA has the world's largest coal reserves and is in the lead for copper, lead, phosphates, rare earth elements, uranium, gold, iron, mercury, nickel, potash, silver, tungsten, zinc, petroleum, natural gas, timber, and arable land.\n\nAmerica's embrace of heterogeneity helps keep it in the lead. 55% of America's PHD students are foreign born. 27 out the 87 (more than 30%) American Nobel Prize winners in Medicine and Physiology between 1901 and 2005 were born outside the US. \n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;This high population puts financial strain on social nets, public education, and other public programs that can lead to problems.\n\nThere are a couple problems with this.  First of all, things like police, public education, utilities, etc., get cheaper *per person* when you have more people, not more expensive.  \n\nSecond, there's something called the [Home market effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_market_effect) which helped win Paul Krugman a Nobel prize in economics.  The idea is basically that in industrial sectors, domestic producers in large countries are able to achieve economies of scale more than producers in small countries.   Thus they are able to lower costs, gain a competitive advantage, and export more.  That's why you get huge companies like Boeing, GM, GE, Google, and Facebook which are very successful around the world.  They were able to develop to achieve scale domestically, then export to the rest of the world.  So the high population is a net good thing for the US economy.

This constructive engagement is more likely to resonate with the original poster than the second response, which, while factually robust, employs a more critical tone that may feel dismissive and confrontational.

If someone want's to excel in their studies, they should be able to go to a \"better\" private school and get a \"better\" education.  \n\nPrivate school being \"better\" is also kind of vague. For education, you get out what you put in. If you try hard in school, you will get a  better education. Students in private schools most likely put more effort in to their education, so on average they come out in a better position than an average student in a public school. More effort = better education = \"better\" school.\n\nSecond Response: \nMany folks here will talk about how not all public schools are the same.  I've lived in four different states, and can attest to that.\n\nBut more importantly *not all children are the same*.  Public school is geared toward the average- if you are above or below - or outside - of the norm, public school is often a difficult or unproductive place for you.\n\nOne of my children is an advanced learner.  She could read well before Kindergarten - mostly self taught.  Guess how boring K was for her.\n\nMy other daughter is extremely creative and high energy - sitting in a classroom all day was problematic for her.\n\nWe homeschooled our family 13 years, which allowed for personalized learning for both students that fit their learning styles.  We are an atheist family and were members of a secular homeschool group with roughly 300 families.  My kids now - one is a successful adult and the other has decided to transition into public school and is looking forward to high school.\n\nYour views on homeschool are, to put it bluntly, ignorant.  The kids are usually more socially adept as they are required to get along with kids of different ages as well as adults.  Kids learn from the older kids and mentor the younger ones.  \n\nBecause of the shortfalls of many public school systems, homeschool groups will often have a higher percentage of students with special needs.  In recent years we've seen quite an uptick of older kids with autism, for example.   So the perception many have of socially awkward/weird homeschool kids - remember the student may be in homsechool *because of a special need*.\n\nAlso - you show your ignorance again when you talk about how great your public school was. \"We had a trip to Europe!\"  Jesus, how oblivious to the rest of the world can you be.  If your school went to Europe, your public school was likely in an affluent area and was practically private school quality. \n\nMy school had a drug cop with a narc sniffing dog.\n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are the tone and emotional approach, engagement with the original poster, and the rhetorical techniques used in the Second Response. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second responder maintains a firm but respectful tone when addressing the original post's viewpoints.

I think these are both great things, but the majority of my peers on Facebook/Twitter are aggressively against it gay rights and the fact that the Confederate Flag is now in the spotlight and being frowned upon. A part of me wants to speak my mind about it and tell them how I feel to reason with them a bit, but the other part of me thinks its a bad idea. Being vocal about my views could potentially cut off half of all people from even giving me the chance of meeting them and potentially being friends with them just because of my political views. I know a lot of people I consider friends that have political views that I don't agree with at all, and I don't know if letting everyone know how I feel about these situations is worth ruining that.\n\nI have also heard quotes about how doing/saying nothing is worse than being against it, and that during the civil rights movement most people were silent which was definitely a bad thing, but I'm not sure if it's worth speaking up.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I know exactly who I can talk to about political issues and who not to. It's not worth it for me to bring up what I think about Reaganomics to everyone I'm friends with because I know that may not go over well in the long run.\n\nAlso, consider that discussion about politics can harbor new thoughts and change people's minds on how they see the world, either for better or for worse. What's wrong with stimulating the mind a little bit? Again, there's nothing wrong with other discussion topics but politics doesn't have to be taboo with everyone.\n\nI would also suggest, don't start talking about your radical stance on the eugenics of the human species by immediately aborting genetically deficient babies with people that you only just recently met (assuming abortion is your topic of choice when discussing politics) because I'm sure the general population doesn't sit well with that idea and/or have never even entertained that idea before.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe short answer: Be selective about who you talk with about controversial topics.\n\nSome of your closer friends are probably already aware that you don't share their political views. So choose the ones among them who you think you could have a conversation with and roll with it. If you're sure you do want to discuss it it's a good idea to lay the groundwork and then talk about it in person. I've seen many facebook conversations that get very heated and completely unreasonable when controversial topics are discussed.

This tone feels supportive and pragmatic, addressing the concerns of the original poster while offering actionable advice.\n\nIn contrast, the first response has a more casual tone and potentially dismisses the emotional weight of discussing sensitive political topics. While it suggests finding the right people to talk to, it does not emphasize the impact of choosing the right context or medium for discussions as effectively as the second response does.\n\nFurthermore, the second response contains specific strategies about how to engage in politically charged discussions, like using in-person conversations to convey tone and body language. This level of detail adds to its effectiveness in changing the original poster's view on discussing politics, making it more relatable and practical compared to the vaguer suggestions in the first response.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 387, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The government should NOT be able to force businesses to serve customers/cater events the business does not want to serve/cater.\n\nOriginal Post: \nSo neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument.\nAll modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.  \nSo prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all.\nPlease excuse the weird grammar and sentence structure, I just woke up\n\nFirst Response: \nOne of the fundamental measures of equality is inclusion and participation in general society. In local communities, being able to eat in the same restaurants, shop in the same stores, attend the same religious services and generally do all the same things as everyone else is in itself a demonstration of freedom and proof of equal legal status.\n\nBeing excluded from such activities singles out individuals in a manner that is not only humiliating but also subjugates those being excluded by denying them the same freedom as everyone else.\n\nWe already exclude and/or remove criminals and those adjudicated mentally defective (or whatever term you prefer) when they demonstrate either a willingness or inability to participate in society in a responsible, trustworthy and/or equitable manner, but only after we can demonstrate that fact according to strict rules and procedures in the judicial system. These rules and structures are in place precisely because the unjust or arbitrary exercise of power, especially to deny the freedom of others, or to otherwise violate their rights, is the very definition of [Oppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression). \n\n[Liberty](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/liberty) is the ability to live, speak or otherwise act freely, especially without retribution or oppression. \n\nWe all have a right to Liberty. \n\nIn the context of America and the philosophy of Individual Rights, which is the basis of our legal system, power and authority are derived from the function of the institutions that exercise that power. Cops can't arbitrarily arrest people for being ugly, they must conduct arrests in accordance with the laws and structures that empower them. \n\nSimilarly, individual citizens cannot arbitrarily exercise power or authority over other citizens. \n\nA gay person entering a business with the intention of paying for services or products is not inherently damaging to a business. Denying such a person service based on the individual beliefs of an owner or employee would be an arbitrary exercise of power, in direct violation of the customer's Right to Liberty. Denying said customer legal recourse against such arbitrary exclusion would indirectly legitimize such exclusion and establish a *de facto* second class of citizens, which is inherently unconstitutional and blatantly harmful for what should be obvious reasons.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the \"Free Market\" would deal with the problem (which btw, does not happen in areas of the country where such beliefs prevail). Excluding people due to personal beliefs is a violation of the Right to Liberty.\n\nThat doesn't even get into the fact that business owners utilize mail, law enforcement, contract law, trade agreements and property rights, among many other things which obligate business owners to treat tax-paying customers equally.\n\nSecond Response: \nBusinesses have the right to refuse service to any individual for any reason.\n\nThey do not have the right to refuse services to protected classes of individuals based on their belonging to that class when they provide those services to other equally qualified customers. \n\nThe first is about individuals. If a black gay female comes into my store, acts like a complete and total jerk I can toss them out for not being someone I want to do business with. I can refuse service because I don't want to be busy that day. I can refuse service because I don't like them individually. I can refuse service because I just feel like it. \n\nThe second is about groups of people. I can not refuse service to black gay females because they are black gay females. I can not withhold services from a person for reasons that have nothing to do with them individually and result only from my assumption of their inclusion in a particular group. \n\nThe reason for this is simple but multi-faceted and rests on a few bits of reality that people don't like to think about sometimes:\n\n1) Businesses exist because of civil society. There's a reason Somalia isn't a libertarian utopia even though there's absolutely no government interference in business. It is because there is no civil society at all that businesses can not function there at all. This is more than just about government and law enforcement too. Governments allow the existence of a high functioning civil society: working infrastructure for business; schooling so that businesses have literate employees; working financial systems by which to transact business; means for customers to move from business to business safely to conduct transactions; and so forth. However, governments are not the sum total of a high functioning civil society. This requires more than a government. Syria has a government. But the people of Syria are not free to live their lives unencumbered by unnecessary interferences in their lives. The question is what interferences are necessary and which are not. Civil society, in the experience of history, seems to work best when all members of society can decide that question together; and with their collective, rather than individual, best interests as the focus. \n\n2) Because business depend on civil society, civil society has authority to tell businesses what they can and can not do in order to maintain that civil society. This includes following laws that limit the freedoms of businesses. Businesses, just like individuals, have to respect the rights of others. You can not intentionally harm other people for no justifiable reason. While you can punch someone in self-defense, the legal defense against that charge is a positive defense not a negative one. That is, you can't say \"self defense\" and walk away. You generally have to be able to show that it was self-defense. You can punch someone in the face. But if you don't have a reason for doing so that society accepts as valid, you've violated their rights and exceeded your own. Likewise, businesses can't do things that are obviously harmful to society, such as dumping raw sewage into the public drinking water. \n\n3) One of the lessons of the civil rights movement is that \"separate isn't equal.\" For civil society to work we all need to have reasonable access to the aspects of society that make society function as a civil society. It is a violation of an individual's rights to execute their own life to preclude them from society on the basis of basic discriminatory practices of the majority. We can't simply say we don't want black people in our schools, or that gay people can not drive on the roads, or that women shall not have access to jobs.  And again, we know that civil society is more than merely the collection of government functions. It doesn't matter if black people have access to the same rights as white people if there are no black people in the area because no one will do business with them outside of the government. \n\n4) Civil society, while dependent upon government is more than government. Through the 1900s people exercised their \"individual freedom\" to refuse business to those in minority groups. The results were segregated communities where black people simply could not live. No one would sell them a private home because the mortgage clauses came with rules against reselling the homes to black people. No one would sell them food, because the local grocers wouldn't do business with \"those people.\" No one would treat them if they were sick and injured, so they would die without proper medical care unnecessarily. None of this involved the power of the state. But the collective actions of individuals of the majority precluding minorities from participating in civil society created significant civil strife and endangered civil society's continued existence. \n\n5) Ergo, the people of the democratic republic demanded that civil society address the issues of lack of inclusion of minorities. The result was that civil society decided collectively that businesses were free to exist and operate within civil society but one of the personal rights they could not violate was the right to not be discriminated against based on membership in a protected minority. Now, this law has plenty of controversy around what should and should not be a protected minority. However, there's absolutely zero basis for any contention that civil society, upon which a businesses ability to exist depends, lacks the authority to set such rules. Further, the experience of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demonstrates quite clearly that failure to consider overt discrimination a crime resulted in significant social harms that negatively impacted civil society in a way that was considered unacceptable, and legitimately threatened it's continued existence. \n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Clarity and Structure**: The second response is well-organized, clearly distinguishing between individual rights and the rights of specific protected classes.

In fact, there is a hormonal regulation mechanism that pauses the menstrual cycle and makes the woman infertile if her body fat falls below a threshold.\n\nIn the environment of adaptation, people were more likely to be malnourished than fat, hence males evolved a sexual preference to avoid investing time and effort to mate with females that looked too skinny, and females evolved to \"advertise\" their body fat by storing it in places where it is most visible in an upright position: the breasts and the buttocks. Co-evolution between male sexual preferences and female body fat distribution created a feedback loop that reinforced these characteristics.\n\nTherefore the vast majority of men are instinctively attracted to large breasts and round firm buttocks. It has nothing to do with \"over sexualization\", it's just biology. (Note that this is different than just being attracted to \"fat\" women, in fact men are generally not attracted to women with an excessive waist-to-hip ratio, which correlates with poor health).\n\nAs for the topless thing, social norms about clothing vary greatly between cultures: In some Islamic countries women often cover head to toe in large burqas, while in some Oceanian tribes people walk around almost naked, women wearing a simple skirt and men wearing only a penis sheath leaving their scrotum exposed.\n\nClearly, Western cultural norms about clothing are somewhere in between. If you want to argue for different norms then you need a stronger argument than just debating the \"sexualization\" of any given body part.\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nYou're sorta right, not really. Womens breasts act in a manner that a evolutionary biologist would call a fitness indicator. If you've ever noticed, all mammals have mammary glands (breasts), but in nearly all cases, the mammary glands are very small until pregnancy happens. Humans are different. Human men evolved to find women with larger breasts more attractive because they tend to be more fertile. This caused sexual selection in favor of larger breasts, which benefitted women with larger breasts, allowing genes for large breasts to spread throughout the population. This is why men are attracted to large breasts, and why women have them.\n\nThen of course, you claim that they are not \"sexual organs.\" The thing is, I don't know what that means. They sure as heck aren't genitals, but they definitely are secondary sex characteristics. A secondary sex characteristic is basically a trait that one gender possesses that the other sex doesn't, yet still doesn't benefit reproduction. For example: arm, body, leg, or facial hair in men, additional muscle in men, breasts in women.\n\nActually, muscle and athletic ability act as a fitness indicator for men in a similar way as breasts do in women, so why do we only sensor women's breasts?\n\nNot trying to argue against you, just bring some extra info to the table :)\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led me to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more conversational and less confrontational tone.

Saying he \"cant follow up on any\" is a bit of an overstatement.  Can he do everything he'd like to do the way he'd like to?  No.  But can he make moves in the right direction?  Sure.\n\nLet's look at his Agenda:\n\n*  1. Rebuilding Our Crumbling Infrastructure\n\nNow, this is something that he'd absolutely need Congressional help with.  But it's not hard to sell as pro-business and pro-jobs.  Americans like highways.\n\n* 2. Reversing Climate Change\n\nThere is a lot he can do with EPA regulations.  And, again, he sells it as \"Transforming our energy system will not only protect the environment, it will create good paying jobs.\"\n\n* 3. Creating Worker Co-ops\n\nFrankly, I'm not sure what, legally would be required for this - whether the department of labor alone can get this done, or he'd need help from Congress.\n\n* 4. Growing the Trade Union Movement\n\nAgain, this is somewhat of a mixed bag, but probably more Congress than DoL.  It's also something that I think has some limitations at the Federal level, since a lot of it is governed at the state.\n\n* 5. Raising the Minimum Wage\n\nDefinitely needs Congress.\n\n* 6. Pay Equity for Women Workers\n\nI believe that there are already laws on the books that he could choose to enforce more vigorously.  But I'm also not sure what he thinks the goverment should do about this.\n\n* 7. Trade Policies that Benefit American Workers\n\nNow, this is something that the president can absolutely have a huge impact on.\n\n* 8. Making College Affordable for All\n\nObama has made some strides here.  I don't know how much more he can do without Congress.\n\n* 9. Taking on Wall Street\n\nAgain, there's a lot more stringent enforcement of laws, investigations into trading, etc that the executive branch can do, but they certainly can't \"break up the banks\" without Congress.\n\n* 10. Health Care as a Right for All\n\nYeah, single-payer for everyone can't happen without Congress.\n\n* 11. Protecting the Most Vulnerable Americans\n\nAnother one where he can't expand social programs without Congress.\n\n* 12. Real Tax Reform\nAgain, Congress needs to amend tax law.  Even enforcing through the IRS is restricted by Congressional law.\n\nSo, after all of this, I think you're view that \"He can't follow up on any of his points\" is an overstatement, but, yeah, what he can do will be limited with a hostile Congress.\n\nSecond Response: \nSanders is perfectly capable of shutting down free trade and messing with the Federal Reserve without Congressional support.\n\nOf course, I would argue that makes him WORSE: because the stuff he's arguing for that his supporters are actually championing for and which may be good won't get passed, but the stuff where he is absolutely nuts will.

It would have done the most, in terms of the war effort. for the least resources (time, materials, energy, man power, and human lives - on their own country's side)\n\ntl;rl No, in the grand scheme of things, as human beings; no, the bombing was not morally justifiable.\nFrom the point of view of a country fighting another country by means of violence; yes, it was economically justifiable.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; the argument \"but more people would have been killed!\" is not valid as we will never know if more people were saved, but more importantly if we can't tell if more people were saved how would the people at the time know ?\n\nYou're right to point out both that at the time of the decision, we didn't know what would happen, and that even know, we have no good way of knowing what would have happened.\n\nBut this uncertainty cuts both ways. Harry Truman did not know what would have happened if he didn't act. But if this means dropping the bombs \"can't be justified\", then couldn't you say the same if he hadn't dropped the bombs? If he hadn't gave the order, and even more hundreds of thousands of lives were lost, couldn't you just as easily say that his decision to *not* drop the bombs \"can't be justified\" because he didn't know what would happen?\n\nThis is just a fundamental problem of making decisions with limited information. And unfortunately, making those sorts of decisions is literally what the president's job is.\n\nSo the questions I would ask when evaluating such an action involve imagining what other people (myself included) would do in his situation. And to really think about that, you have to put yourself in his position. You are responsible for the lives of millions of Americans. There's a war going on right now with people fighting and dying, and you don't know how its going to end. You don't know how many more of your people are going to fight and die and suffer because of your decisions. And now you are given the opportunity to end it all, but not without a cost. You don't know what will happen, but you kind of just have to do the math based on your best assessment of the situation. I don't think it was a decision that was made lightly. We'll never know if it was \"right\", but I think given the situation at the time, it was reasonable.

It balances between a blunt delivery and an objective analysis of war's morality.\n- **Second Response**: The tone is more measured and seeks to engage thoughtfully with the original poster\u2019s points. It acknowledges the complexity of the situation and refrains from personal attacks, instead inviting the poster to consider the perspectives of decision-makers during wartime. This can foster a more respectful dialogue.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response**: Utilizes a direct approach and dichotomy in its reasoning, contrasting moral and economic justifications. It makes a clear stance using definitive statements, but this does not invite further discussion.\n- **Second Response**: Employs a theory of limited information decision-making, using a hypothetical to help the original poster personalize the experience of Truman's decision. This technique encourages the original poster to empathize, making the argument more relatable.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response**: Uses short, informal sentences making it clear but could lack the depth needed for complex topics. The casual language may be less engaging for an audience looking for nuanced discussion.\n- **Second Response**: Presents ideas in a more structured manner, utilizing longer, more complex sentences that demonstrate depth of thought and encourage critical thinking. The use of \"Imagine\" and \"You are responsible\" invites the original poster to visualize the scenario.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response**: Lacks direct engagement with the original poster. While it critiques their viewpoint, it does not pose questions or encourage them to think more deeply about their stance. This approach may lead to stronger pushback rather than changing minds.\n- **Second Response**: Directly addresses the original poster\u2019s concerns and builds upon them.

I believe that pouring milk first provides more time to eat fresh cereal.  \nIt seems though, that most of the world, including 99% of my friends, does it the other way; no one has provided me with an explanation as to why I should do it otherwise.

To be honest, I don't know if my view has completely changed, but I definitely recognize the validity of cereal first.  It seems that it is a more efficient to obtain the \"perfect milk to cereal ratio\".  However, I think that is all due to preference and for those that don't really know how much milk or cereal they want.  I guess the best way I can explain my own preference for milk first is similar to soup.  I pour the soup in before adding croutons or something.

{"index": 393, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: There will never be another military draft (forced conscription) in America.\n\nOriginal Post: \nNot really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  \n\n1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  \n\n2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription\n\n3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.\n\n4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. \n\n5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.  \n\nPlease change my view!\n\nFirst Response: \nThe US will revert to a draft as soon as the US deems it necessary - which is when the number of volunteers do not met the numbers required.\n\nTo counter some of your points, look at this example: World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, [over 10.1 million](https://www.sss.gov/induct.htm) of the US's sixteen million service members were *drafted*\n\nThat's right, WW2, a popular war most people today agree was worth fighting for, drafted over 60% of its servicemembers. Simply put: the US needed manpower, it drafted even when 6 million men volunteered.\n\nKeep in mind too that conscientious objection was an even bigger issue in the past than today. The US was staunchly isolationist up until WW2, and many religious exemptions existed for groups like the Quakers.\n\nIn addition, those servicemembers all served overseas. In fact, Vietnam was similar - the US maintained more troops in West Germany during this time than in Vietnam. Conscripts weren't sent just to fight in Vietnam - many were sent to fill in ranks in Germany to keep our obligations there. \n\nOur obligations worldwide are smaller today, true, but they still exist and may certainly grow again in the future.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou're only considering military threats, there are other scenarios that could mean large numbers of troops are needed, for a range of tasks.\n\nA huge natural disaster, such as a large scale volcanic eruption, small meteor impact, solar flare that knocks out the electrical supply worldwide - all of these would have massively disrupting implications in the US at home, and abroad. Civil disorder, food and water supplies being disrupted, large numbers of refugees, all of these could require the military to step in, requiring large numbers of additional personnel, which might have to be drafted.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor that leads to this prediction is the First Response's strategic use of historical context, particularly referencing World War II, where conscription was essential due to immense manpower needs.

The tone is assertive yet informative, engaging directly with the original poster's points and providing a nuanced argument that addresses the complexities of conscription during times of demand.\n\nIn contrast, the Second Response, while presenting alternative scenarios for military involvement necessitating a draft, feels less grounded in historical precedence. The tone is speculative and lacks the same convincing evidence weight. It also doesn\u2019t engage directly with the original poster's arguments with as much depth, making it less compelling.\n\nThus, the First Response's effective use of historical examples, combined with its direct engagement style, positions it as the more persuasive response in potentially changing the original poster's view.", "is_correct": false}

{"index": 395, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the legalisation of polygamous marriage\n\nOriginal Post: \nIn the argument against gay marriage, people often use the \u2018slippery slope\u2019 argument that it\u2019s legalisation would lead on to polygamous marriages also becoming legal. I\u2019m not interested in arguing whether or not this *will* happen, but why it would be a bad thing if it did. This would be within the context of people being allowed to have multiple marriages, you would not automatically be married to your spouse\u2019s other spouse, although you could choose to do this.\n\nWhile I personally am not interested in polygamy, what's wrong with it? \n\nIt's natural for humans to live in groups. 'Tribes' or 'family' whatever you would like to call it. I don't see anything wrong with families that have several adults to act as role models for children. I just can't see why it would be detrimental to children to be raised in that environment.\n\nTo be allowed to marry you need to be a consenting adult and in being one people can make their own relationship decisions. As long as there isn't a sex bias (e.g. men can have many wives but not the other way around), then I think that people can make their own decision about whether a polygamous relationship is something they want. They retain the right to get divorced if their spouse marries someone else when they want a monogamous marriage, just like people retain the right to get a divorce if their spouse cheats on them.\n\nPeople sometimes argue against polygamous marriages saying that people are already legally allowed to have polygamous relationships, why get married? Because of the legal privileges associated with it? When I get married the legal benefits of being married are going to be way down on the list of reasons. Getting married is a way to show your love for someone. \n\nA big argument going against it is that the legality of it would be very complex. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily the case. If you died your possessions would be divided up amongst your spouses. Your children would either go to their other parent or be claimed by a next of kin who wants them, with fitness to look after them being determined by a court of law. As is the case currently with children whose parents die without leaving a will e.g. should they go to uncle A or uncle B? There are lots of examples of legal contracts which are binding to groups of people, why couldn\u2019t this be applied to marriage? It could be encouraged, or even possibly mandatory, to have pre-nuptial agreements which define legal aspects of the marriage relating to property ownership, etc. prior to getting married if you\u2019re married to more than one person. With current spouses also signing this document.\n\nI\u2019m not really that interested in ethical arguments. Why should one person\u2019s ethics determine how other people live their lives? For example, I don\u2019t think I would ever have an abortion for my own personal ethical reasons. That doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m against other people having the option.\n\nI'm really interested to know if anyone has any good arguments against polygamous marriages. I think a lot of people are against them for their own personal ethical reasons, because they don\u2019t want one themselves, rather than for an actually good, justifiable reason.\n\nSo please try to CMV! I\u2019m going to try to reply to every direct response to me. I get really p***ed off when people cherry-pick arguments and ignore the ones that don't suit them. If there are a lot of responses it may take a while though so please be patient! But in saying that if you reply purely because I\u2019ve committed to responding; if you put forth a low-effort comment you will get a low-effort answer.\n\nEdit: I'm getting a bit tired so off to bed for me before anyone else comments &amp; I feel obliged to stay up and discuss this some more! I will definitely be back so please keep the discussion going! \n\nEdit2: Right, there's a fair few replies so I will be going through them. Although a lot of later comments are using arguments that have been used before I'm still determined to reply to all of them. It may take me a while as I unfortunately have other things that I need to be doing, such is life, so I will get to you eventually!\n\nEdit3: I have finally awarded a delta! Apologies to anyone whose comment I missed, but thank you all for being part of the conversation. It was very entertaining and I definitely feel a lot more informed. So you don't have to scroll down &amp; find the explanation for my delta, I'll give it here: \n\"While I still think there is nothing wrong with polygamous relationships &amp; the concept of some sort of legal commitment, this couldn't be marriage. You could have some kind of legally binding partnership with multiple partners which has some of the benefits of marriage, such as recognition of the partnership affecting things like visitation rights and a legal claim to be next of kin, but this wouldn't be the same as marriage as we have it now. It's not so much about when people in the marriage are living together, but if things later needed to be taken apart. There is just no way to predict every possibility for a pre-nuptial agreement, and the situation could get so complex that you couldn't have a standard that could be fallen back on every time.\"\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nThe best arguments against polygamy aren't moral-there isn't anything morally wrong with multiple spouses if everyone agrees-they're practical. Marriage is a major status change that you choose to enter with another person. It means the law acknowledges who can visit you in the hospital, make decisions for you if you're sick, raise your kids if you die or make decisions for them if you're absent, who can share your bank account and affect your credit rating, and who gets half your stuff in divorce. Marriage is a major change in your rights and responsibilities towards specific other people. \n\nWhen you can only be married to one person at a time, both people have to consent to it. That changes with polygamy. I agree to marry my wife, but what if later she wants to also marry her boyfriend or girlfriend? Can this third partner make decisions for the children I had with my original wife? Does the third partner get part of the property my wife and I accumulated together if they divorce out? Does their debt affect my credit score? With polygamy, your rights and responsibilities towards specific people can change *without* your consent, if one spouse chooses to marry someone else. And what if the new spouse is also married?. You might end up with a lot of people you don't know/didn't choose having the ability to majorly impact your life.\n\nEdit: I see that you respond to these kinds of arguments by suggesting people contract around it, but this isn't a workable solution for marriage. 1) Ideally, marriages last for the rest of your life. 50+ years. There is just no way to foresee and contract for every situation where you will have the opportunity to impact your spouses over that kind of time span. Marriage is fundamentally accepting the risk of future uncertainties with another person, of having to deal with the unforeseen together. That's why it's so important that people explicitly agree to the person they take that risk with. They can't effectively contract for all the unknowns and separate risks, and they might not want to be bound by the exact terms of an agreement they signed 20 years ago anyway. Love lives are not great places for contracts. 2) Even in the seemingly simple areas where you would think you can contract, you can't. Like with property, income doesn't stay separated once it comes in  to the household, and in divorce judges try to compensate people who sacrificed career opportunities in service of the family unit. There is no neat way to divide it into fractions or to give that paper fraction actual meaning out of your household property and bank account, and it will inevitably impact the spouse who did not marry the third spouse. Prenups between relatively simple two-spouse marriages are overturned, redrafted, or declared void all the time; the sense of predictability they offer is illusive, especially if you move states (every state has its own divorce laws). They wouldn't help much at all with polygamous marriages.\n\nThings can go wrong with your spouse, but you consented to the risk by marrying them.\nThings can go wrong with your children, but you accepted that risk by having and keeping children.\nThings go wrong with your spouse's spouse, and you didn't have to sign up for it to ruin your credit or garnish your wages or otherwise massively impact your life. That's an issue, and it can't be easily solved by introducing more contracts into personal relationships.\n\nSecond Response: \n\"Wrong\" is a word that pertains to morality. So it's odd that you don't want a moral argument. \n\nBut anyway:\n\n* Is everybody equal in such a marriage? Does it vary depending on the time they've been married?\n* Can new people be added?\n* How is it structured? Is it 3 women married to a man, do they form a ring, or a mesh?\n* Related to the above, how does divorce work? Can it fail due to disagreement?\n* Is there a size limit? What if a whole town decides to get married, imagine the work untangling that will be.\n* What if one person is in the hospital and there are two others that can make a life or death decision, and disagree?\n* There are practical social issues. Eg, rich man gets himself 20 wives. Enough of that will skew the ratio in the community, resulting in some really pissed off people.\n* Who do the children belong to?\n* The court system will probably need an upgrade. We're talking about dramatically increasing complexity and opportunity for conflict.\n\nI don't oppose the idea in principle, but the practical issues seem to be tough to solve, and I doubt they're about to get worked out tomorrow. Maybe as a society in a decade or two we'll reach some sort of general agreement about what such a thing is supposed to look and work like, but today it doesn't seem like we're there.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Given the analysis of the stylistic elements of both responses, I predict that $$Answer: First Response$$ successfully changed the original poster's view.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The first response adopts a more serious and pragmatic tone, focusing on the potential complexities and consequences of polygamous marriages. It emphasizes practical implications and concerns, which are more likely to resonate with someone actively seeking to understand the opposing viewpoint. The second response, while also practical, comes off as more rhetorical and less engaging.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:** The first response employs a structured argument that systematically addresses the issues related to rights, responsibilities, and the implications of polygamous relationships. It includes direct questions and considerations that challenge the original poster's views. The second response lists concerns in a less organized manner and does not build the argument as effectively.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The first response has clear sentences and a logical flow. It carefully guides the reader through its points, making it easier for the original poster to engage with and consider the outlined arguments. The second response, while readable, comes off as more fragmented, listing concerns without thorough exploration.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:** The first response directly addresses the original poster's points and refutes them with specific counterarguments, demonstrating a clear understanding and engagement with the original post. This direct interaction provides more substantial grounds for changing the original poster's view. The second response's engagement is less direct and more focused on posing questions rather than countering arguments effectively.\n\nIn summary, the first response's practical focus, structured arguments, and direct engagement suggest a stronger potential for influencing the original poster compared to the second response.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 396, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: NYC sucks\n\nOriginal Post: \nI used to want to live in NYC, but after travelling there multiple times and talking to friends who have lived/currently live there, I could not be more dead set against ever moving there. In fact, I have come to despise that place. As a quick note about the perspective I have: I'm a 3rd-year law student. I grew up in South FL, and currently live in Boston, MA. I'm not a stranger to life in a northeastern American city; maybe city life in general is not for me, although I do like Boston *much* better than New York. \n\nFirst, it's filthy. There is trash *everywhere*, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. Being an old Northeastern city, it's filled with old buildings, many of which are in varying degrees of disrepair. It's just generally a dirty, sad place for me to be. \n\nIt's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.   \n\nThe cost of living is exorbitant, as everyone already knows. Rent alone takes up most of my friends' paychecks, and their places aren't even that nice or spacious. New Yorkers seem like they pay through the nose for a standard of living that ain't that great.\n\nThen there's the climate. The winters are frigid and soul-crushing, complete with biting wind and extended periods of low sunlight or darkness. The summers are sweltering, and the heat only exacerbates the ever-present smell of rotting garbage. Plus, central air is apparently only for the wealthy northeasterners, because it is conspicuously scarce in most homes/apartments I've visited. \n\nI can't understand the allure of that city. The wealthy live comfortable lives while most everyone else pays through the nose to live wretchedly. People get an inexplicable sense of self-importance and accomplishment simply by moving there and living there for a bit, regardless of what they're doing. Maybe I'd feel accomplished too, if I paid $800/month to live in a cardboard box and resisted the temptation to commit suicide by antagonizing the psychotic, fascist police to which NYC is a home. \n\nTL;DR NYC is a crowded, dirty, dismal place and I cannot ever picture myself being happy there. CMV. \n\n\nEdit: I'm well aware of the shitty aspects of Boston life; to me, NYC's bads are more...well, *bad* than Boston's, that's my point. Also, inb4 \"hurr Florida has bad things about it too.\" I definitely know that's true!\n\nEdit 2: FOLKS, this post isn't about \"Boston &gt; NYC\"; I'm well aware that there are bad parts about Boston too. Pointing out bad shit about other cities doesn't help make the case for NY. \n\nEdit 3: For everyone who keeps bitching at me about the delta I gave to u/whattodo-whattodo - READ THE FUCKING RULES. Quoting rule 4's explanation of delta: \"Please note that a delta is not a sign of 'defeat', *it is just a token of appreciation towards a user who helped tweak or reshape your opinion*.

Moved in a few months ago from a small CT town and would like to provide my input as I have fallen in love with my City and Neighborhood. \n\nYour first point, \"It's filthy and old and in disrepair.\"  Since you don't live here you may not understand that many of the buildings that look like they're in disrepair are actually some of the most hip and interesting places. For example, My office building is an old Brass Factory in Williamsburg Brooklyn and from the outside it kinda looks abandoned, but walk in and you'll see that it has a very aesthetically pleasing interior. Don't judge a book by its cover. On top of that, yes NYC is an old city, therefor it has a rich history resulting in an overwhelming appreciation and desire for vintage styles/fashion/lifestyles/art/etc.. That's why I believe Brooklyn and other parts of NYC have been deemed a Hipster hub. Old, doesn't always mean bad. For the trash, yes, there are parts that are more dirty than others, but much of the city is really clean too. I think your experience with the trash might be a bit narrow minded.  \n\nIt's crowded. Yes, yes it is and thats a beautiful thing. I always get an appreciating for the human race when I'm walking through a sea of people because it's an achievement to be able to sustain so many people in such a small area. Also, those Disheveled/drab people are also some of the smartest and most innovative people in the nation.  On top of that NYC is probably one of the most diverse and ethnically accepting cities in the world. With all these people comes exposure to new cultures, rituals, food, outlooks on life, etc. \n\nCost of living is high and salaries reflect that. The average salary for a particular job in NYC is higher than other places. Rent is so expensive, but you're not paying so much to sleep in a small apartment but rather paying to be so close to all the action. There is so much to experience that if you're staying in Mon-Fri, you're not doing NYC right. \n\nClimate. Boston just had record snow falls and a much harsher winter than us. The heat, just comes with the north east. In the summer, it's always humid and hot. That's not just for NYC, thats everywhere. The smell of garbage can be a problem and it's most prevalent in the subway systems, where it can get uncomfortably hot, but this is mostly in the touristy areas of the city where non-residents think it's ok to liter. I've seen tourists litter waaaaayyyyy more often than residents who have an appreciation for their city. \n\nIt seems like you're mostly describing parts of Manhattan. I invite you to come to my Neighborhood in Brooklyn. PM me when you're in the city next and I'll treat you to an immaculate cuisine and unforgettable night that you'll only be able to experience here.\n \n\nSecond Response: \nI'm a native New Yorker. It's really not as smelly or dirty as you make it out to be, though it can be quite expensive if you want to live in certain areas of the city.\n\n&gt; There is trash everywhere, the water is polluted, and the air simply does not smell clean. \n\nThere are plenty clean and nice spots in the city. I was just at [Gentry State Park](http://cityphile.com/photo/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Gantry-State-Park-4897.jpg), where I didn't see any litter and even saw some people kayaking on the East River during sunset. I'm originally from Queens, where there are plenty of quiet, nice-smelling neighborhoods.[ Forest Hills](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Forest_Hills_Gardens,_Queens,_NY.jpg), for instance, is a pretty woodsy neighborhood with a really nice suburban area. Doesn't smell like shit. You just have to get out of Manhattan.\n\n&gt; It's also crowded. NYC has ~8.5 million people crammed into around 300 square miles. To walk anywhere, you must wade through a sea of drab, disheveled humanity. The public transit is packed. Driving in NYC is one of the most hellish experiences I've ever had.\n\nI'll admit, NYC can feel a bit crowded when you're on a packed train trying to commute to work, but otherwise, I've not experienced having to wade through crowds of people on a regular basis. And if I do, I wouldn't call the typical New York resident a member of \"drab, disheveled humanity\". In fact, some of us are quite good-looking and take pride in our hygiene. \n\n&gt; The cost of living is exorbitant.\n\nSalaries are adjusted to the cost of living, to some small degree. But you're probably still thinking of Manhattan (and some trendy parts of Brooklyn). When you go out into the outer boroughs, rent can easily go down to 700/600/500 per month, which isn't terrible. When you weigh the cost of living in a small space to the availability of basically everything (i.e. food, nightlife, cultural institutions, people, schools, etc.), then I would say lots of people would give up a front yard to live in a place of diversity and activity.\n\n&gt; Winters are frigid and soul-crushing.\n\nThis is undeniably true. [But hey, at least we're not Boston, whose largest snow pile just melted yesterday.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/14/422939198/the-last-boston-snow-farm-finally-melts)\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the First Response's tone and emotional approach. It uses a friendly and inviting tone that emphasizes personal experience and positive sentiments towards NYC, contrasting sharply with the original poster's negative perceptions. The use of phrases like \"fallen in love with my City\" and the invitation to experience Brooklyn's cuisine suggest an openness and willingness to share the beauty of NYC, thereby fostering engagement.\n\nAdditionally, the First Response employs rhetorical techniques such as providing personal anecdotes and counterpoints to the original poster's complaints, positioning them as relatable. The encouragement to perceive the city's grime as part of its historical charm is an effective reframing strategy aimed at shifting the original poster's perspective. This contrasts with the Second Response, which, while also containing personal anecdotes, strikes a more defensive and dismissive tone, focusing on rebutting each point rather than offering a more positive narrative about NYC. \n\nConsequently, the First Response's engaging and affectionate approach likely made a stronger impact on the original poster\u2019s outlook compared to the more critical nature of the Second Response.", "is_correct": false}

{"index": 398, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The result of the Supreme Court case on gay marriage is the next step in the \"sexual revolution\" and might have certain negative implication on society.\n\nOriginal Post: \nFirst of all, I want to first express how happy I am with this subreddit. It has always been a hub for civilized discussion on complicated and difficult topics. I have never witnessed uncivilized discussion on here before and I'm glad to be a part of the community. Good job, Reddit!\n\nWith that said, if you are unfamiliar with the sexual revolution I am referring to, this is a time beginning in the 1960s where people experienced an \"urge to 'find oneself'\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_revolution)). During this time, lots of previously taboo'd sexually related acts, ideals, etc entered into society and have more recently, at the end of the 20th century have thoroughly integrated themselves into it. This involves a large variety of things including but not limited to: proliferation and normalization of pornography, sex before marriage, acceptance of sexually explicit movie/television material, contraceptions, and the LGBT movement.\n\nFor example, pornography, which was formerly unheard of in public conversation is now often not only discussed, but glorified and upheld as a great thing. This is just one example of what I am talking about. *I am not arguing the moralities of pornography however.*\n\n**My argument: **The recent decision by the Supreme Court to rule in favor of gay marriage is simply the next step in the sexual revolution and essentially negates some of the arguments against the next step after this; I am specifically referring to  incestuous relationships, and other ways of \"loving\" someone. However, I will mainly refer to incest for the sake of a shorter discussion.\n\n* One of the main arguments against gay marriage is that it is \"unnatural\". One could also argue that incest is unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.\n\n* Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage. The term progressive is very open for interpretation, but eliminating discrimination is very straight forward. If someone named Cercei loves her brother named Jamie, should it be allowed? Should they be allowed to marry and procreate? Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality. *For more information on incest please view this very informative [documentary](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0068473/).*\n\n* Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.\n\nWith gay marriage legalized officially, these arguments become unsubstantial and hypocritical to argue with against incest.\n\n**In conclusion, my fear is that the sexual revolution has the potential to continue to progress and eventually today's taboos will become everyday occurrences all on the basis of equality and non-discrimination.** This has the potential to effect humans on not only a genetic level by potentially allowing incest to corrupt human genetic material and cause genetic disorders, but also on a societal level where humans become more concerned with catering to someones sexual identity/preference rather than the actual person inside. I believe this could be devastating to humans. I don't claim to know what would happen, but it isn't too difficult to come up with a worst-case scenario of what society could become when the main focus of peoples interactions is politically correctness, being non-offensive, and catering to every form of person on a sexual basis.\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions and I will be happy to clarify.\n\nCMV,\nTresky\n\n*Disclaimer: I am in no way attempting to say that gay marriage in and of itself is causing the downfall of humanity and am not attempting to demonize or put-down members of the LGBT community. I am merely making a case of a path that humanity could potentially be (and I now believe is) on that leads to a corrupt and evil society.*\n\nEDIT: Added information.

One could also argue that incest and pedophilia are unnatural, but even more broadly, any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.\n\nMarriage is unnatural, humans present both monogamous and polygamous behaviour, marriage is outrageous and against nature.\n\n&gt;Gay marriage activists very frequently champion progressive thinking and non-discrimination as basis for legalizing gay marriage.

Incestuous relationships very often breed deformities and retardations in children; should these children be forced to have an incomplete, handicapped life on the basis of equality.\n\nNope if they want to love each other or have sex that's fine, but having children should be illegal in some way.\n\n&gt;Should pedophilia be legalized on the basis of \"eliminating discrimination\"\n\nPedophilia is almost indistinguishable from child abuse, and thus no, homosexuality is, just like heterosexuality, pretty darn distinguishable from rape, and thus they're both ok.\n\n&gt;Another argument against gay marriage has frequently been that it further inhibits the ability for the human race to procreate. This is fairly obvious as to why people say this: a man and a man cannot bear a child and vice versa. However, the same argument stands for incest; in fact, it is worse. Incestuous relationships don't further the human species, but rather they turn it backwards by corrupting genes and eliminating diversity. Also, as previously stated, incest often results in retardation in the resulting child.\n\nHaving children via incest should be illegal, homosexuality is a thing, and preventing gay people from marrying isn't going to make them straight all of a sudden, and one way of the other, the world is insanely overpopulated, and thus the less people that are born the better, the world would become a great place if suddenly everyone became homosexual, since natality would fall into nothingness and population would readjust somewhere reasonable.\n\nSecond Response: \nI don't see how you focusing on the marriage aspect fits with your stated fears. Gay people are already freely and openly having sex in Western society; that ship has sailed long ago. America finally allowing gay couples to get married doesn't really change that. Along those lines, whether a gay couple is officially married doesn't change whether they can bear a child in the traditional manner. Marriage is pretty irrelevant to your concerns.\n\nOne of the worries you list is that society will become inordinately focused on catering to every form of sexuality. But actually, accepting that homosexuality is not a big boogey-man means we can stop putting so much focus on it. Instead we can all go on with our lives. That's the opposite of having this inordinate focus on the issue.\n\n&gt; any sexual relationship outside of marriage between a man and woman can be argued effectively as unnatural.\n\nYou're talking specifically about the laws and legal decisions of one specific court in one specific country in one tiny moment in history. Nature, and specifically human nature, existed long before the supreme court did, or before the concept of legal state-sponsored marriage.

{"index": 399, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:I think toll roads are pointless\n\nOriginal Post: \nI have lived in Columbus, Ohio my entire life and have now been legally able to drive for 5 years.  I have driven near and far and have never had to take a toll road.  I recently ventured into Pennsylvania for an internship and was absolutely flabbergasted by the toll roads.  I have always heard from people that they are good because they have higher speed limits.  A lot of the free highways i have been on have 70 mph speed limits and when I went into Pennsylvania, I paid $5.00 to go 40mph on a \"highway\" for a whopping 2 miles.  I also have gone through some other toll roads since my time here but that was the most obnoxious one.  Anyways I just think they are pointless because in no way did it make my travel more convenient.  Maybe I just don't know enough about them but please change my view!\n\nEdit:  After reading through the comments, I really like the explanation I heard that either there will be a toll road in place or that road simply won't exist.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

What they give us the ability to do is put the cost of a road on just the people who use it, rather than *everyone* regardless of whether they use the road or not.  They give you the choice.  You don't have to take the toll road.  You're welcome to take the free route and go more slowly.\n\nSecond Response: \nToll roads are often created and maintained by private companies. Regardless of how fast you may go, companies need to pay taxes for using the land on which they have built the road. The public roads you travelled on are payed by your taxdollars, but private companies must also pay taxes to maintain their private roads. The money has to come from somewhere.\n\nAside from this, toll roads also create detours from the regular chokepoints in public highways. People use the roads because it provides a shorter path to their destination. Additionally, people use toll roads because they want a consistent path to their goal. If, say, people wanted to get to work on time, they would rather use a toll road that provides a consistent 20 minute lag than use the public road, which may vary from a clear road to a full hour of lag.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses to the original post about toll roads, I will focus on the stylistic elements and engagement factors.\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response:** The tone is assertive and somewhat informal, using the phrase \"toll roads are fantastic,\" which may come off as overly simplistic. The response emphasizes personal choice and places a value judgment on the decision to use toll roads versus free roads, leveraging a positive tone that may resonate with drivers who appreciate the choice aspect.\n  \n- **Second Response:** The tone is more informative and educational. It presents information in a structured manner, using facts about private companies, taxes, and road maintenance. This approach might elicit a more thoughtful response from the original poster, as it conveys a sense of depth and understanding about the subject matter.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response:** This response utilizes a straightforward argument regarding personal choice in road usage. While it presents a reasonable viewpoint, it lacks detailed backing and examples that could strengthen its claim and convince the original poster.\n  \n- **Second Response:** This response integrates various points \u2014 the role of private companies, tax implications, and the reliability of toll roads. By connecting these ideas, the response paints a broader picture of why toll roads can be beneficial, engaging the original poster at multiple levels and providing more grounds for consideration.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response:** The sentences are concise and easy to read. However, they may lack depth, which could limit the persuasiveness of the argument.\n  \n- **Second Response:** This response employs a mix of longer, more complex sentences combined with clear points. This increases its readability for those looking for a well-rounded, thoughtful analysis, despite being slightly denser.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response:** This response directly addresses the poster's concerns about convenience, suggesting that toll roads are not mandatory, which could be seen as dismissive of the poster\u2019s experience. It doesn't fully engage with the more practical concerns raised in the original post.\n  \n- **Second Response:** This response directly engages with the poster\u2019s experience and concerns about speed and convenience. By explaining the broader implications of toll roads and touching on the concepts of consistency and reliability, it successfully addresses the original post with a relevant perspective.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Key Factors Leading to Prediction\nThe second response successfully incorporates a comprehensive understanding of toll roads by providing factual information about how they function and their benefits. Its balanced tone, informative nature, and engagement with the original poster's concerns about speed and convenience make it more likely to shift the original poster's view. The first response's simplicity and limited engagement with the broader context make it less convincing.", "is_correct": false}

Chopsticks give me the flexibility to more precisely control the direction and the amount of pressure that I can apply on the fish to cleanly extract out bones.\n\nSecond Response: \nThings which you must not pierce (soup dumplings) are much more difficult to eat with a fork, especially if you want to eat it in more than one bite. \n\nChopsticks are easier to carry around. \n\nChopsticks are good for eating popcorn without dirtying your hands.\n\nChopsticks can be dual wielded (quad wielded?) for extra efficacy when eating. \n\nChopsticks are excellent light-duty tongs for cooking, and they don't damage non-stick cookware. \n\nChopsticks beat eggs much better than a fork, and don't leave marks on bowls in doing so. \n\nWith chopsticks you can handle a wide range of sizes from single grains of rice to entire steaks, and more if you use two pairs at once. \n\nMakeshift chopsticks work.

I am sure that any mature human can understand this desire and for that emotional reason would advocate for assisted suicide. But to legally define such an ultimate act, what does and does not warrant it, who presides over it, even, who is responsible for it, are such complex questions and I believe are not the responsibility of a governing body.\n\nI looked into it a lot in an Australian context, since that's where I live and it was temporarily legalized in the Northern Territory, from 1995 to 1997, it has also been put to government multiple times since. During the time the Australian Medical Association stated their firm stance against the concept and I feel quite eloquently stated their argument, \"The AMA believes that medical practitioners should not be involved with interventions that have as their primary intention the ending of a persons life.\" When a request for assisted suicide is made by a patient they often suffer a mental disorder, depression or dementia. \n\nBut I suppose you specifically want an argument against prisoners in life sentences to voluntarily end their life to ease the system? A very noble, altruistic notion. I would say that the people making such requests are also suffering from a mental condition. It goes against human nature to want to die, in such a dramatic environment I can quite easily see a warped perception of reality in the inmates. \n\nI don't think the answer to the problem of the prison system is to assist in the suicide of life prisoners. Can you imagine what corruption would entail such a possibility? I believe that many external factors would pressure or influence these people into doing something that they may not truly wish for. I would advocate alternative options to reduce the strain on the prison system, sentence reform, prison reform, as well as a better management of these people to rehabilitate them into society. A prison should not be a place to keep people away from society, more importantly it should aim to rehabilitate them. \n\n\n\nSecond Response: \nThe problem here is that the \"point\" of prison is either to rehabilitate or punish the prisoner. Either goal is failed if the prisoner would rather die. \n\nIf that option was available, I'm sure many would take it. Many take that way out already. \n\nInstead of allowing the powerless and institutionalized prisoners to end their lives since there really isn't any way for them to stay out, maybe we should look into ending privatized prisons that *want* to keep them in for business, and improving the culture and procedures for release. \n\nWe shouldn't be putting prisoners in the position where they *want* to end their lives in the first place. Putting that option out there for them is a clear message: We don't care about you, and you have no way out of this life. Save us some money and let us kill you instead.\n\nSudden changes in lifestyle and environment *can* cause depression too, which is another concern I have. If being put in prison for 15 years doesn't make you depressed, I don't know what will. Depressed people have a harder time making rational decisions, especially involving self-harm, right? So why would you put someone in a position to *make* them depressed, then offer them suicide as an alternative? Prozac or Cyanide, pick your poison.\n\nMy other major concern is that this is essentially a way to cheat around capital punishment. Even if it's only available to lifers. Think about it. They seek the death penalty in court, settle for life in prison, then say \"but you know, you can still kill yourself if life in prison doesn't sound like a good life.\" \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include the tone and emotional approach, rhetorical techniques, and degree of engagement with the original poster.

This approach acknowledges the original post's concerns while suggesting alternatives and fostering a conversation about prison reform, thereby encouraging the original poster to reconsider their view on the issue.\n\nIn contrast, the First Response, while informative and involving personal reflection, leans heavily on concerns surrounding mental health issues without offering a more holistic perspective on the state\u2019s responsibilities towards rehabilitating inmates. This response may come off as more defensive or analytical rather than empathetic, making it less persuasive in changing the original poster\u2019s mind.\n\nThe Second Response\u2019s provocative questioning about the implications of such an option and its emotional pull likely resonate more deeply with the original poster's highlighted issues around suffering and choice.

People were saying this was shameful, and embarrassing to the US military, a ridiculous simplification. To be clear, I am no fan of Huckabee, and I have nothing against our military or militaries in general. That said, I think he was dead on.\n\nI think most people who don't accept this do so because they think it's crass, and brutal. Well, yeah, but it's also absolutely true. That's why the military has all those rifles and artillery and tanks and battleships and bombs and chemical weapons and knives and humvees and machine guns: for the killing of people and the breaking of things. Sure, not every member of the military's job is to be a killer, but those people are there to support the killers. The cooks, mechanics, engineers, and secretaries are all there to let everyone else kill people and break things as safely and efficiently as possible.\n\nAgain, I have absolutely no problem with this from a moral perspective. I am certainly not condemning anybody, just stating facts. Most people I've seen disagree with Huckabee are just dancing around this. \"Soldiers exist to protect the United States and her interests!\" Sure, using violence or the threat of violence. \"The army doesn't just kill people, they developed the Internet!\" Yeah, as a weapon to coordinate their violence in the most efficient way possible. The internet we have now is just an unintended side effect.\n\nThe US military is in a bit of a unique position, since they haven't had a lot of opportunities to do their job recently. Our military is so badass, there are not a lot of people with enough courage or stupidity to take us on. Thus, a lot of time is spent running practice drills and handing out food to people after earthquakes. That's great, but it's all a displacement activity until they need to do their real job. It's a sideshow, a distraction. The alternative would be these men sitting around, waiting for something to need destroying. We don't keep our military around and spend billions of dollars for disaster relief. We keep them around to kill people and break things.

{"index": 403, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Modern feminism is hypocritical and flawed\n\nOriginal Post: \nTo say that women and men are equal is simply incorrect. I absolutely do not mean to say that one is better than the other, only that there are fundamental physiological differences between men and women that feminists appear to disregard. Now, in my opinion feminism seeks to advocate that anything that men can do, women can also but only when its convenient. To me it seems like feminists want to have their cake and eat it too. I will give a few examples that I always think about to illustrate my point.\n\n1. The Ray Rice incident. What happened was unfortunate and of course he shouldn't have hit his wife. However, if this was Ray hanging out with another football player and knocked him out, this would not have been a story. Its because he punched a woman that this became a big deal. How can the feminist movement suggest \"Men should NEVER lay their hands on a woman\" but still say that men and women are equal. My answer is that its because men are generally stronger than women, but then that's my point. If you are going to advocate that they are equal then they should receive equal treatment. Again, CMV.\n\n2. Rape cases. In college I have been required to watch numerous sexual harassment videos and attend mandatory training seminars on sexual assault. In these videos they always paint the male as a bad guy and its always targeted towards men. Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges. Why is this on the guy? People use the phrase \"Victim Blaming\" and say that its not on the girl regardless of the fact that she drunk. So what if she had gotten drunk and drove her car into a tree. Can she then say \"Maybe that wasn't a good idea\" and then get off the hook?\n\n3. The draft. This one has also bothered me. According to the United States Selective Service Act, all men between ages 18-25 are required to register for the draft and may be picked for military service if the draft were to be implemented. Why are feminists all over the country not outraged about this? Shouldn't it be men AND women that are required to register for the draft? After all, men and women should be able to perform wartime duties equally right? It just seems like people pick and choose when its convenient for gender equality\n\nOf course there are certain things that should be equal. Wages, education, etc. However I feel that a push for gender equality in every aspect of life is fundamentally wrong. CMV!\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

But here goes nothing:\n\n1. A feminist might say that men shouldn't use violence against women because men are powerful enough to defend themselves against women without needing to resort to very much violence, or any violence at all. What they're trying to express might be the idea that since you're only justified in using as much force as is reasonable to prevent harm to yourself, and that men could in most cases prevent a woman from inflicting any sort of meaningful harm on them with a very minimal use of force, men shouldn't use very much force when protecting themselves from women. I think this is an overgeneralization; some men are really weak and some women are really strong, and that matters in evaluating when and how much force is justified. Some men are perfectly justified in using a lot of force against a woman to defend themselves. But the underlying principle, that men should be careful not to use too much force when defending themselves against women, is a good one, and I don't think it very charitable to declare all of contemporary feminism flawed because some, *not all*, feminists are making a hasty generalization.\n\n2. This one is easy; a tree is not a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, so getting drunk and crashing into a tree is entirely your fault. However, a person who wants to have sex with you *is* a moral agent with a duty to respect your autonomy, and if such a  person decides to fuck you while your capacity for rational decision making has been subverted by alcohol, they are raping you. So comparing a drunk driving accident to being raped while intoxicated is a disanalogy. Feminists see this bad comparison made *a lot*, so you're not alone in this error. It's like the [Wasson selection task](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7NE7apn-PA) of feminist thought.\n\n3. If you ask feminists about the draft, most will give you a two pronged answer; first, that women should be allowed to serve in the military in any capacity in which they are able, including combat, and second, that nobody should be forced to serve against their will. That's an implicit argument that the draft is unjust, so essentially you're asking why feminists aren't outraged that women aren't also subjected to this unjust treatment which men are subjected. If they're right that any sort of draft is unjust, and I think they are, then you're asking feminists to beat women down here rather than raise men up, which is a perverted sort of justice if you ask me. You might want to say that feminists should advocate for ending the draft, and that's fine. Problem is, feminist activists tend to be women, and women are perfectly justified in focusing on issues that affect them. They aren't obligated to focus their activism on men's issues. Feminists who are men are perfectly capable of addressing the draft issue, and should do just that. Heck, you could do that yourself, right now!\n\nAlright, so to wrap this up; if you approach feminism in good faith and in a non-facile way, you're going to find that the project as a whole is not at all flawed or hypocritical. Unfortunately, it's pretty obvious your exposure to feminism has been via the bad faith arguments typical of the MRA/redpill/etc. movements. I highly recommend learning about feminism from sources that aren't explicitly hostile to it. Read bell hooks' [*Feminism is for Everybody*](http://www.amazon.com/Feminism-Everybody-bell-hooks/dp/0745317332), it's a really great intro to feminism, especially for people like you who have been exposed to it uncharitably.\n\ne: Also, I'm only going to reply to OP.\n\nSecond Response: \n1. It's wrong to hit anybody. Men *shouldn't* ever lay a hand on a woman nor should they lay their hand on a man. And when feminists are talking about equality they're not making the claim that women are as physically strong on average as men. They're talking about equal value as a human being in society, not physical prowess.\n\n2. \"Perhaps I have misunderstood something but if a guy and a girl are both under the influence and they decide to have sex, the girl can then decide the next day that maybe it wasn't a good idea and that the guy should have known better. The guy is then facing rape charges.\" Is this what really happens most often? Or, is it more often the case that the female is drunk, the man is not, and he takes advantage of the situation. Two drunk people having a one-night stand does not result in rape charges nearly as often as one sober and one drunk/unconscious person does. \n\n3. First of all, there are feminist groups such as SWAN (Service Women's Action Network) who push for female-inclusion in Selective Service. Second, the Draft is not a relevant issue today. Neither you nor anyone else is going to be drafted any time soon. Feminist groups--like any politically-active group--typically focus on *relevant* issues that actually affect people. So it's no wonder you don't see a lot of attention placed on it by feminist groups because at this point it doesn't really affect anyone one way or the other. Yes, men have to sign up for it, but it's only a relic of a system that is no longer used. If people were actively drafted and the majority of feminists supported the current system, you might have a point. But since the draft is not something that is likely to happen any time in the near future, you can't really blame feminists for wanting focus on more relevant issues.\n\nIt's difficult to address your problems with feminism because you haven't brought up any specific examples of mainstream feminists. You have no citations. There are also multiple schools of thought on feminism so I don't know if you're attacking intersectional feminism, third-wave feminism, both, neither, etc.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response is likely to have successfully changed the original poster's view due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response employs a more supportive and educational tone, addressing the original post's concerns with an intention to clarify misconceptions and promote understanding of feminist principles.

Either they discriminate on merit or they discriminate based on race/gender. Many schools use scholarships to promote diversity, but not necessarily just racial diversity. They know that they can't get every applicant they accept to enroll in the school, so a lot of schools will pad their \"yield\" (percentage of students accepted who enroll) by offering generous merit scholarships to top students. In the same way, if a school wants to help improve its perception with regards to diversity or race relations or social justice, it's using scholarships to incentivize students with particular traits to enroll.\n\nThe scholarships that are designed for people who are not purely academic achievers were never meant for those students anyway. They wouldn't exist without the school needing to create a diverse environment. Colleges can't exist without the student bodies that make them up. Many colleges just hand out their scholarships to help mold their incoming class into the perfect blend (in their eyes).\n\nSecond Response: \nSo (and please don't take this the wrong way, as it's coming from a recipient of a \"diversity scholarship\"), I would wager to say that out of every 100 total scholarships that are available, about 20 have restrictions about who can apply (maybe that number is higher, I'm not sure, let's say 20). Being a white male, you are statistically more likely to be in the front running for those 80 other scholarships. This is not your fault, as you didn't choose to be a white male, but the 20 people who are in the front running for the other scholarships didn't choose that either, and I'm sure if the system was fair, they would be advocating for the elimination of special requirement scholarships, but the fact of the matter is the system isn't fair. \n\nLet's take a look at the inner-city public high school system for a moment. These schools are woefully underfunded, woefully underserved, and (generally speaking) are largely minority based. Chances are the students who attend said high school will not be afforded the privileges of those who attend a more well-to-do high school in the suburbs (eg SAT/ACT prep courses, AP classes, etc.), thus making them (potentially) less likely to have the requirements necessary for certain scholarships. This is not the fault of the student, it is the fault of a broken system.\n\nLong story short, I suppose, people from traditionally more privileged heritages (eg: white males) are more likely to obtain the criteria necessary for scholarships, based purely on the failings of the public school system, and that is why race and gender based scholarships apply. Because those students who get race based scholarships prove to be just as successful at the college level, but perhaps wouldn't get the chance if not for scholarships geared towards them.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "**Analysis of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - *First Response*: The tone is informative and slightly defensive, aiming to clarify the purpose of scholarships and how universities utilize them.

Whatever features you are looking for in a car, you can get better features for the same or a lower price in a used car. Like, say you have $25,000 to spend on a car. You could get a nice new Toyota, or you could get a fully loaded Lexus that's less than a year old and has features that are superior in every measurable way to the new Toyota. Seems like a no-brainer to me which one I'd buy. So basically, aside from people for whom money is truly no object and I suppose people with pathological fears of sitting where others have sat, I just can't imagine any good reason for the average Joe with a limited budget and no debilitating phobias to buy a new car. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

We all want a cheap, lightweight, rear wheel drive sports car.

What makes fiction a better alternative to those activities?\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt; Fiction merely provides entertainment. It doesn't help us grow at all.\n\nThat is unequivocally false. Fiction can be entertaining but its value comes from its ability to help the reader (watcher, listener &amp;c.) grow. Good art will express something the consumer already feels or knows but is unable to describe (how *Hannibal* treats and presents the beautiful and grotesque identically), or force on to the consumer an experience or point-of-view alien to them (like the post-war dissatisfaction and purposelessness of WWI vets as presented in *The Sun Also Rises*), or explore an aspect of life in an allegorical way to highlight certain aspects of it (like how *Alien* is one big giant rape metaphor). All these things can be done in exciting ways but the goal is not excitement. \n\nThese things contribute to the personal growth of the consumer in ways dry non-fiction or unaided introspection cannot. It's one thing to read about Russia's 19th century identity crisis, but another thing entirely to anthropomorphize it and view ideology on such a personal scale (The Brothers Karamazov). It's one thing to think about how charming people can get away with horrible things, but another thing entirely to be drawn in yourself without even realizing it (Lolita). It's one thing to read \"people usually prefer independence to dependence even when there are costs associated with the former\", but another thing entirely to read:\n\n*Here at least*\n\n*we shall be free; the Almighty hath not built*\n\n*Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:*\n\n*Here we may reign secure, and in my choice*\n\n*to reign is worth ambition though in Hell:*\n\n*Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.*\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; Fiction merely provides entertainment.

Here are some examples: \n\n * Video games like \"This War of mine\" try to offer a perspective of struggling civilians in a war-torn country for those lacking first-hand experience of war.\n\n * The novel \"Animal Farm\" can convey a basic understanding of political and sociolgical development of capitalistic societies into autocratic dictatorships.\n\n * Reading classical German poetry, like the famous works of Goethe, can complement a historical education about Central Europe in the 18th and 19th century, as well as giving insight into moral and cultural ideas prevalent during that time. \n\nAs I tried to point out, the distinction between \"waste of time\" and \"effective use of time\" isn't that clearly cut.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response exhibits a more passionate and assertive tone in its defense of fiction\u2019s value.

I've been to a wedding recently and I got vegetarian courses, it was really no hassle for anyone... but I looked at the courses with fish and meat and I just thought of all the stuff they'd be throwing away that day... if I ate meat and fish that day it would have made NO difference at all... maybe it would have been better, saved the cook some work...\n\nFor me the key point is not BUYING meat rather than not eating it, I get it, and having vegetarian stuff served that day and making things look positive for everyone and having conversations with others about being vegetarian was a positive thing... but the actual contribution to things?

It's about changing the discourse. A few decades ago, far fewer people were taking vegetarianism and veganism seriously. Now we have conversations about animal rights and welfare in public. There have been more animal cruelty related posts and comment threads on Reddit in the past year than I remember previously \u2014 and far less RAH RAH WHAT'S WRONG WITH EATING MEAT type replies. More and more restaurants are offering vegetarian and vegan options. Eventually \u2014 not soon, but maybe in a generation or two \u2014 I would not be surprised if the majority of people on the liberal side of the fence started to shun meat-eating, as has happened with social issues in recent years. And at that point, change will be sweeping and sudden.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think I see where you are coming from, especially concerning one of your other answers where you said that it is very rare to meet vegetarians in your country. I'd say you look at it the wrong way, though.\n\nAs you said elsewhere, meat consumtion is rising. The reason for this is that it is easy and normal to eat meat, and not normal and harder when you do not. The more people that primarily eat vegetarian and vegan food, the more plausible it is for restaurants to sell vegetarian food, and the easier it is for people to choose to be a vegetarian, and the more vegetarian and vegan food is offered in other circumstances. In my region of the world, and then I mean maybe the closest 5 to 15 million people, the availability and accessibility of vegetarian and vegan options has risen dramatically in the last few decades, even though meat consumtion has risen as well due to changed habits of omnivores.. but this is turning, as of a few years ago. Omnivores are now lessening their amount of meat in their diet, and even more people are turning vegan and vegetarian or just \"I don't eat meat very often\"-etarian, and it has gone to the point when arranging some events the crew don't even ask who is vegetarian, who is vegan anymore. They just simply offer vegan food for everyone instead, unless someone explicitly specify that they need meat, or whatever.\n\nSince meat need approximately ten times as much land to produce the same amount of food as veggies, and meat production is said to stand for close to 20% of the amount of climate change gases, this may have an enormous effect. Not very much for each veg*n by themselves, but due to the effect they have in motivating each other, motivating others, making selling veggies plausible for restaurants, and in the end have a so much larger effect on the world than they ever would by themselves.\n\nIt's pretty much like voting, except they/we do it every day, so the possible effect is probably a lot larger.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response has an optimistic and forward-looking tone, emphasizing the potential for societal change and progress on the issue of vegetarianism and veganism.

Part of me wants to have my own children but I can't justify birthing my own kids when it's such an extremely selfish motive. Sure, once you've had the kids it's selfless because of how much you have to give up for them. But the initial desire to birth them in the first place is selfish. I want my own children because I want to carry on my own genes. I want to have a little human that resembles me.  As a woman, I want to experience the feeling of a baby inside of me. These reasons are the main reasons why people choose to birth their own kids. \nHere's a few reasons why I find it selfish.\n\n1. There are plenty of children out there without parents. Over 150 million orphans, not to mention foster children. Then here are people who are trying to birth their own when there are so many helpless children without a loving home.\n\n2. There are over 800 million people starving in the world. People are dying from hunger and you're trying to bring another mouth that needs feeding into the world.\n\n3. This reason may be a little unexpected but it's something I'm personally afraid of and so I feel it's a valid reason. I'm agnostic. You can believe whatever you want about the afterlife but that doesn't mean you actually know what will happen to us after we die. Whether we go to a heaven, a hell, are reincarnated, cease to exist or whatever else people can come up with. You just can't  know for sure and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves. Now that being said, say hell is a reality. I hope it isn't but you never know. What if you birthed these children out of your selfish desire and they did just whatever it took to have themselves sent to hell forever. Even if you did pick the \"right\" religion doesn't mean that your child is going to believe it. \n\n\nHonestly, I would love for someone to change my mind. My ex and I broke up over this because I want to adopt children and he wants biological children. I just can't morally justify purposely bringing children in the world.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

It is innate in our biological make up to want to have children and raise them.   If everyone felt like you did, we'd have an opposite problem. In fact, Japan does have that problem and the US could be not too far behind them some believe.   While true plenty of children could use a good home, that doesn't take away the biological desire to have your own children and the good that can come of having your own.    I can't see why you can't do both. \n\nI'm not so sure hunger is an over population problem as much as a logistics or greed problem.   We have plenty of food to feed everyone in the world now, we just don't distribute it correctly.   You sound like a smart person, we could use smart genes being passed down into the pool.  That is a helpful thing to society.  \n\nYour last point is a strange one indeed.  I'm atheist, not agnostic, but we'll leave that argument for another time and place.   However, being as I am, I can really address your beliefs on that point as they're not mine, so I'd just leave it to say that's a really remote thing to concern yourself with over wanting to have kids.   \n\nI love my kid.   Not only does he look like me but he acts like me too, its evident even though he's only 3.  I think the bond we'll have when he's older is far stronger than anything I could achieve if I adopted a kid, who I could love equally, but I'm not sure the same bond would exist.    Evolution has spent a long time perfecting things and there's a reason you _want_ to have a child, and why that child acts and looks like you.   \n\nSecond Response: \nFor point 2.  We don't really have a problem making food for people. Transporting food is the problem(logistical or financial).  Unless you live somewhere where that is an issue your extra mouth doesn't take food out of another's. It's no more selfish than feeding yourself. \n\nAs for point 1. That voice in your head telling you to have a child is what connects us to all other sentient life.  We exist to reproduce.  It's how we lived to take domain over the earth (and moon) in a darwinian sense you are acting selflessly sacrificing time energy and possibly health to broaden the human gene pool. (this also answers point three for me as well.  Unless you believe humans are truly special in the eye of some deity then we can be punished for being the animals we are.) \n\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To analyze the two responses, we will break down their stylistic elements and engagement with the original poster's (OP) viewpoint:\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response**: The tone is somewhat casual and straightforward, attempting to convey a sense of shared understanding of the biological urge to procreate. The responder addresses potential worries of overpopulation with a counterpoint focused on the evolutionary basis of having children. It also introduces a personal anecdote about the bond with their own child, making the argument feel more relatable.\n- **Second Response**: The tone feels more clinical and less personal. It takes a more logical approach to counter the reasons presented by the OP. By using phrases like \u201cthe voice in your head\u201d and framing the desire to reproduce as instinctual, it underscores a deterministic view of human behavior but lacks the personal touch that might resonate more emotionally with the OP.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response**: Utilizes analogies (comparing procreation to survival issues) and personal anecdote (the love for one\u2019s child) effectively to build empathy and connection. This response invites reflection on both sides of the argument.\n- **Second Response**: More reliant on logical structure and less on emotional resonance. While it emphasizes a Darwinian viewpoint by outlining the biological necessity to reproduce, it does not leverage personal stories or emotions effectively.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response**: Composed of relatively longer sentences with variances in form, making it a comfortable read. It flows logically from one thought to another, which aids in comprehension.\n- **Second Response**: Has a more abrupt and terse structure, with shorter sentences that may lack smooth transitions. It can come across as slightly disjointed, which may hinder engagement and retention of ideas.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response**: Engages directly with the OP's points, giving genuine attention to concerns about the selfishness and ethics of having children. It asks questions, uses phrases like \"you sound like a smart person,\" and includes personal experience that may enhance relatability.\n- **Second Response**: Primarily focuses on dismissing the OP\u2019s concerns with counterarguments, but does not effectively engage with personal feelings or potential biases of the OP. It leans more towards argumentation than genuine dialogue.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Key Factors\nThe first response is likely to have successfully changed the OP's view due to its empathetic tone, engaging personal anecdotes, and a consideration of both the emotional and logical aspects of parenting. It strikes a balance, recognizing the OP's concerns while effectively arguing in favor of the instinct to have children. The personal touch and relatable content are more likely to resonate with the OP compared to the more detached and logical approach of the second response.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 410, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:If Women have the right to be Pro-Choice then Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood.\n\nOriginal Post: \nHello CMV!\n\nFirst of all regarding my own ideas and politics, I would consider myself a Thatcherite and believe in individualism, freedom and responsibility for our own actions (more on this later). This has potentially shaped my ideas on the matter but I thought I'd throw it out there. Please don't judge me on my politics but on the content of the CMV.\nI believe that in a free society people have the right to decide whether they should keep a baby or not, women have the right to abort or raise a child. However I believe that men deserve the same right after sex with regards to the child (it takes two to tango). If a mother decides to keep the child then the father deserves the right to accept, or opt out of, fatherhood including all of the repercussions and payments that could be associated with such.\n\nI understand that the state assumes the right of the child &gt; the right of the parent, however I believe strongly that the father has the right to continue to live his life without sinking payments into a child which was optionally chosen. If a man decides he does not want to keep the child then he has the right to refrain from supporting it throughout its life.\n\nOr on the opposite, if a mother is given the option to keep a child, willingly knowing the father does not want to, then she is accepting the responsibility of raising a child by herself, as she has no right to enforce payments on a consenting man who did not wish to have a child.\nObviously this excludes rape and all other implications, this is only within consensual sex.\n\nTL;DR: Men deserve the right to decline fatherhood, and refuse payments for a child they did not wish to claim responsibility for, in a consensual Pro-Choice environment.\n\nEDIT: Slight confusion/comments regarding abortion, I believe that it is solely the woman's responsibility as to whether she should abort or not, it is her \"pro choice\", however fathers have the right to \"opt out\" of fatherhood, or responsibility for that child should the mother keep it.\nEDIT2: This is going pretty well, some good discussions. As suggested another way to put this would be 'Committing to sex is not committing to parenthood\". \nTheScamr worded this nicely:\n&gt;Right now a woman cannot be compelled to be a mother, either financially, custodially or emotionally due to abortion or adoption. Pro choice advocates say when a woman consents to sex she is not consenting to motherhood. OP is asking whether men should also be free such compulsion and the same condition : consent to sex is not consent to fatherhood, either financially, custodially or emotionally.\n\nEDIT3: This has sparked a really nice and balanced discussion, so thank you CMV. It's a controversial topic because while Men should have the same rights as Women, the rights of the child seem to take over that of the father, but not the mother. I think /u/Billy90 put forward the best argument against this.\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

It sucks that men can knock up women and then have no say in the matter over whether a child is born or not, and have to pay to support their unwanted children based on the mothers' wishes. It's not fair that women get to deal with pregnancy and men don't. It's not fair that men are able to physically remove themselves from a pregnancy situation and ditch the woman to deal with it however she can best. It's REALLY not fair to grow up with one of your parents never acknoledging you exist, leaving you at a disadvantage assuming the mother isn't either wealthy or lucky enough to have a very good support network/social safety nets to rely on. It's not fair that this argument comes up as a comparison to women being allowed to control what they do with their reproductive system, as though that's the same as a man controlling his wallet.\n\nThis is adulthood. Being a responsible adult means a few different things for biological men. Sucks, but there it is.\n\nSecond Response: \nI'm a little late to the party, but want to present the issue a little differently, so here goes:\n\nAs the issue involves two competing rights, the legal system in deciding this issue needs to apply an Oliver Wendell Holmes-style balancing test. The two competing rights are:\n\n1. The right of the child to receive financial support from his/her parents\nvs.\n2. The right of the father to decline financial support to a child he did not consent to father\n\nI specifically say financial support, not fatherhood, because courts do not (and cannot) force a father to be \"involved\" in a child's life; they can't force the guy to love the kid. The courts can compel the father to pay money, though; the issue is a financial one.\n\nSince the two rights stated above cannot co-exist, the state is forced into a decision because whether the state acts or not, it will be promoting one party's rights over the other.\n\n1. If the state *acts*, and compels the father to pay support, it is promoting the rights of the child over the rights of the father, vs.\n2. If the state *does not act*, and allows the father to withdraw support, it promotes the rights of the father over the rights of the child.\n\nThus, the balancing test: forced into a decision between promoting one party's rights over the other, the state balances the benefits and detriments of deciding in one party's favor.\n\nThis issue is usually presented as the rights of the child outweighing the rights of the father. I actually look at it from sort of the opposite way- it's not that the rights of the father are less that the rights of the child, its that **the father is better able to bear the burden of having his rights deprived than the child is**. Thus, the courts decide in the child's favor.\n\nExample of what I mean: Say a father earns $3000 per month, and his hypothetical child support payments are $500 per month- a huge chunk of his income. If the state acts and compels the father to pay the child support, it is significantly burdening the father by depriving him of 1/6 of his income. *However* (and it sounds shitty to say, but) the father also has the *ability* to recoup the $500. The father can aim for a promotion and increase his salary, or take a second job. The father has the ability, in theory, to recoup the money the state has deprived of him.\n\nThe child, on the other hand, has no such ability. Children cannot work, so if the child loses out on the $500, that $500 is gone. Thus, the father, through his theoretical ability to earn more money, is better able to bear the burden of being deprived of his rights, and the courts rule in the child's favor.\n\nImportant notes!:\n\n1. I understand how shitty it is to say \"oh, the father can just take a second job.\" This is *not* an ideal solution to the issue; it is a balancing test choosing between the lesser of two evils, the evils being depriving one party or the other of their rights.\n\n2. As such, a better solution is a stronger social safety net. In an ideal world, a single mother would receive enough support from the government to negate the impact of losing the father's financial support. If this were the case, I could see the argument that it shifts the balancing test in the father's favor. As it is, however, with so many single mothers raising their children in poverty, there is clearly not a strong enough social safety not, and so the balancing test is applied as is.\n\n3. The *best* solution, however, is to prevent the situation from happening in the first place. This means (a) comprehensive sex education in schools and (b) widespread access to affordable (or better, free) contraception. In Colorado, a program that gave free IUDs to low-income women dropped the teen-pregnancy rate and abortion rate by nearly half each. This also, undoubtedly, had the effect of forcing fewer fathers to pay child support to kids they didn't want.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response presents a more analytical and reasoned tone, focusing on legal principles and balancing rights. This approach is less emotionally charged than the first response, which leans more on the unfairness of the situation but without providing a detailed framework for understanding the complexities involved. Such a tone often resonates better with individuals who appreciate logical discussion over emotional appeals.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs a structured argument by introducing the concept of a balancing test between competing rights, which helps to clarify the legal nuances involved. It acknowledges the complexity of the issue and uses specific examples to illustrate its points, making it more relatable and digestible. By contrast, the first response relies on general statements about fairness without as much critical analysis or structured reasoning.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response is well-structured, using bullet points that outline the competing rights clearly, which makes it easy to follow. This clarity makes it more accessible for someone trying to understand the arguments being presented.

I assume that this is bound to be brought up, so I will answer this first. \"That means that marriage isn't as special and you can just drop out freely whenever you want\". I don't see this as a viable argument, because if someone is going to leave, then they have a reason to. Even if its a bad reason, or a really good reason, making the person stay by the threat of losing lots of money and/or possessions will only make the marriage worse and worse and cause the couple to fight more and more. \n\nI see no reason whatsoever why anyone should be able to take legal action if their spouse decides to leave then.

If one member leaves a marriage because their partner is abusive or violent, then it isn't an amicable or dispassionate end to the relationship. Don't you think that it's right for the victim to ask for any compensation?\n\nSecond Response: \nThere are many marriages where one spouse has given up his or her career to take care of children. In case of a divorce this person is now at a tremendous financial disadvantage because re-entering the workforce after several years can be difficult. Do you think it would be unfair if you were caught in such a situation without marketable skills?\n\nAlso let's say a couple has joint finances and are both working. Should the spouse pursuing the divorce not be entitled to his or her share of the money in the finances?\n\nAdditionally, decisions regarding custody of children can be difficult as well and can be considered punitive by some in the divorce process. An even split of custody isn't always a good outcome if one spouse is abusive. If one spouse intends to move, this would put unnecessary strain on children. All of these factors need to be considered in some way.\n\nUltimately, without such measures in divorce proceedings, a stay at home parent is at a disadvantage and financially will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce. This allows the other spouse to act in any manner he wishes, knowing his spouse will not leave him without great difficulty. Divorce proceeding should not be considered punitive, but should be considered the pursuit of the most just outcome for all parties involved (both spouses and the children). Your argument centers on the fact someone can be caught in an unhappy marriage for fear of losing money/children. But your solution doesn't solve this problem, someone caught in a relationship with an abusive or cheating spouse will have no recourse regarding custody of kids or financial compensation and therefore will be discouraged from pursuing a divorce.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include the second response's comprehensive engagement with the nuances of divorce and its consequences.

Of these three only the Riot Worlds is the only really big tournament, with 16 teams and a good playoffs and group stage format.\nMSI features only the best team of each region and the IEM World Championship uses Bo1 groups into Bo3 in the first playoff bracket, which is often criticised as too random for the title.\nThe league structure in all major regions is usually divided into a spring and a summer league with a regular season of 18-40 games or so, followed by playoffs to see determine who the best teams in the region are.\n\nIn the other major eSport titles (Dota, SC2, CSGO) you have \n\n* way more tournaments in general\n\n* way more international competition in general\n\n* more important games, as you have more playoff situation\n\nThis all leads to my opinion that LoL eSports has the most boring circuit, as the majority of the matches that are being played are low impact matches in the regular season and only in domestic competition.\n\n\n\n**Edit:** I would appreciate if you help me understand some of the arguments that you apparently think brushed aside. All I see is that you downvoted me, without really understanding why. I would really appreciate if you be patient with me and make me understand what excactly I am missing that should change my view.\n\n\n**Edit2** Thanks to everyone who was patient with me and argued even if I didnt seem to get your point. I have some more stuff to think and while my view wasnt really changed I got some stuff to think about. Maybe I will come back in the near future with some of the core issues I see now clearer which are the basis for my view.\n\nGood Night everybody!\n\n\n**Edit3** Since this is over eSport lets make some shameless plug: There are atm tournaments going on:\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/faceittv This is the faceit final at Dreamhack Valencia with CS:GO, where some of the best team battle for a prizepool of 150,000 $\n\nhttp://www.twitch.tv/dreamhacksc2 This is the Dreamhack Valencia tournament for SC2 with a prizepool of 25.000 $\n\nAnd while I dont have a link ready atm, there is also the IEM Shenzen in SC2 going on with some of the greatest players from Korea, also competing for a prizepool of 25.000$.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Tournaments provide intense moments but don't give exposure to anyone except the best few teams. Look at some of the most popular teams in league of legends: Unicorns of Love, CLG, Gambit. None of these guys are favourites in regional tournaments, let alone full on international ones. Without the league system none of these much loved sides would get exposure. \n\nSecond Response: \nI don't see how you can say more tournaments and competitions equals more important competitions what I love about League in comparison is that you have a series of events that are regionally determined all leading up to one grand event with the entire world. I like that. I like seeing the regions work to better themselves and seeing how their different metas and strategies will interact when they finally meet at world's. \n\nFrankly, having constant international tournaments gets boring for me because you see one meta develop with very little creativity happening in different places. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to the prediction of the Second Response being more persuasive are:\n\n1. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The Second Response engages directly with the poster's arguments, addressing them in a more personal manner, indicating a thoughtful understanding of the original poster's perspective. It highlights the appeal of the league structure and contrasts it with the perceived monotony of constant international tournaments, resonating with the original poster's concerns about the lack of excitement in LoL's current format.\n\n2. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The tone of the Second Response is more enthusiastic and affirmative, expressing a personal preference for the league format and the competitive journey leading up to large tournaments.

This not only presents a personal opinion but invites the original poster to reconsider their stance by illustrating that the excitement in the LoL format can be found in the regional competitions rather than purely through larger, more frequent international tournaments.\n\n4. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The Second Response is structured in a way that builds on existing thoughts while providing a smooth flow of ideas, making it easier for the original poster to digest and potentially contemplate. The clarity and personal touch help emphasize the unique aspects of the League system without overcomplicating the argument, thus making it more relatable.\n\nIn contrast, while the First Response presents a valid point about exposure for more teams, it lacks the emotional engagement and direct connection that the Second Response offers, making it less likely to persuade the original poster to change their view.", "is_correct": false}

At that level, they were the ones giving the orders. No one was press-ganged into high-ranking positions in the SS. It was a largely volunteer force that that always had its pick of the most fanatical recruits. No one on trial at Nuremberg held the rank they held against their will.\n\nSecond Response: \nSo I'm going to answer this in three aspects - \n\nFirst, legally. The Germans surrendered unconditionally. That means the Allies were free to try the Germans in whatever manner the Allies desired. The ground rules for the Nurember trials wer set down in the [London Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Charter), which prohibited \"I was only following orders\" as a defense. (The Germans decided to use it as their defense anyway). I'd also like to point out that the British prosecutor at Nuremberg, Hartley Shawcross, went to great lengths to show that the trials were not a case of post hoc justice. That is, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were guilty of many crimes under both German and international law predating the War. \n\nSecond, as other people have said, the Germans on trial at Nuremberg were the top surviving leaders of Germany. \n\nThird, even if they were not high ranking, \"I was only following orders\" is not a legal defense for soldiers *at any level*, from the lowliest private to the highest ranking general. Soldiers have a duty to disobey illegal orders. \n\n&gt; You can't legally force someone to allow themselves and their families to die/suffer badly even if it means saving others lives\n\nIt's a shitty position to be in, but yes, we absolutely can expect that.

It addresses the original poster's view decisively but without significant emotional engagement. It presents factual information but lacks warmth or an empathetic approach.\n   - The **Second Response** has a more structured and informative tone, using a methodical approach to break down the argument into three parts. While it maintains a serious tone, it employs a more engaging style with the use of a list to convey its points, which might be perceived as more considerate of the original poster's quest for understanding.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - The **First Response** relies primarily on presenting a counter-factual statement regarding the rank of those on trial, which could come across as dismissive of the original poster's concerns.\n   - The **Second Response** employs a tripartite structure that allows it to address various aspects of the original argument comprehensively. By preemptively breaking the response down and providing references (e.g., mentioning the London Charter), it utilizes persuasive rhetorical techniques that provide foundational context and authority to its claims.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - The **First Response** is brief and direct, but may lack elaboration that would help the reader fully grasp the implications of its assertions. It may also seem less accessible due to its succinctness.\n   - The **Second Response** uses varied sentence structures and thorough explanations.

{"index": 414, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Human labor will become as redundant as horse labor\n\nOriginal Post: \nYesterday, there was this post in /r/futurology titled **[Technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data](http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/17/technology-created-more-jobs-than-destroyed-140-years-data-census)**. In the comments, a lot of people concluded that this means that in the future, technology will keep creating more jobs than it destroys. **I disagree**. \n\nAt the moment, a five year old kid can beat a computer in a lot of things. For example, having a conversation is very hard for AI. So there are still lots of simple jobs that cannot be done by technology. \n\nAs long as our civilization does not collapse, technology and AI will keep getting better. In the near future, self-driving cars will replace a lot of jobs. This kind of stuff will keep happening until mechanical brains outperform human brains, at a similar or lower cost. When that happens, human labor will become as redundant as horse labor. **Change my view!**\n\n**[Obligatory \"Humans Need Not Apply link\"](https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU?t=3m31s)**\n\nFirst Response: \nI agree that most unskilled labor jobs will be made redundant. But it won't be as bad as most people think, here's why:\n\nAlmost everyone forgets about competition. There will be multiple companies in the future automating food production / delivery / sales. These companies will compete on price. As they both save costs by automating they will lower their prices (if you don't lower your prices no one will shop with you and you'll go out of business). Eventually this will drive the cost of food to almost zero. \n\nSimilar events will unfold in housing, clothing and other markets. \n\nOnce this happens it will be fairly easy for people to have their basic needs met at almost zero cost and the government will provide this for them (else they'll be riots, that's what happens when people get hungry). \n\nNow skilled labor in research and technology won't go away for a long, long time (at least until they invent real AI). There is literally infinite technology we can invent and create and almost infinite medical problems to solve. We could have all 7 billion people in the world working in technology and medicine and we still wouldn't have anywhere near enough. For anyone that wants to work and puts in the effort to get into these fields there will be an endless supply of things to do. \n\nSecond Response: \nI actually agree with you, but there's a couple of things that I think might be able to prevent this for occurring.\n\nNanobot implants inserted into the brain could help cure degenerative diseases in the future. Beyond that, they could go on to boost human capabilities to machine like levels.\n\nIt's possible that humans may be able to compete with machines for jobs in the future because of this. It wouldn't be an ideal scenario, but it would maintain the status quo. That could be a dangerously powerful effect. A structure that forces people into strengthening that structure could persist long after it has become redundant. \n\n\nThe other thing is a bit simpler. The dream is that machines do all the work while humans live a life of leisure, right? But, maybe a life of leisure wouldn't be all that enjoyable. Human desire to build something for themselves or be remembered could keep people working. Maybe not in a way that you'd call \"labour\" but on personal and collaborative projects or works that they share with others.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are:\n\n1. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response acknowledges the original poster's concerns while providing a counter-argument that effectively engages with their ideas. The mention of competition in markets provides a broader economic context, addressing not only the issue of job redundancy but also presenting a potential solution that is likely to resonate with the original poster\u2019s concerns about survival and well-being.\n\n2. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response carries a more optimistic and reassuring tone, suggesting that while some jobs may be lost, there would be societal adaptations that would compensate for these changes, potentially easing worries about the future. This positive view of technological evolution might appeal more to the original poster than the somewhat speculative and abstract considerations offered in the second response.\n\n3. **Clarity and Structure**: The first response is structured in a clear and logical manner, making it easily digestible. It outlines a progression of thought from current circumstances to potential future scenarios, which could effectively guide the original poster to reconsider their position. In comparison, the second response, while thoughtful, presents ideas in a more complex manner which might not be as immediately compelling or relevant to someone looking for a more articulated argument against their viewpoint.\n\nThese aspects suggest that the first response is more likely to have impacted the original poster's view positively.", "is_correct": false}

From what little research I did, it is being framed as along the same lines of bulimia and anorexia. On [this website] (bedaonline.com), the causes sound very similar to plenty of other mental disorders, but nothing specifically points out that this is something that qualifies as a mental illness other than \"genetics\".  Also, among their treatment options, you've got \"movement classes\", yoga, and meditation. If it were truly a mental illness, wouldn't it be a little hard to just will away? These treatment options seem to just be a really nice ways of saying...go on a diet.\n\nI don't want to be insensitive about this subject, thus why I'm here. The main issue I have with this \"disease\" is that essentially feels like a medical excuse for a lack of self discipline and dedication. They've even got a pill for it. If stretched far enough, this can include other eating disorders, but BED seems to differ in that anorexia and bulimia stem from a lack of positive body image. BED, on the other hand, seems to err in the opposite direction. You eat because you're sad, and then you are disgusted because you just ate three times what you should have, so you eat again.\n\n\n---\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone who replied. There's been tons of valid points made here, and I haven't been able to reply to every one of them, but I I do have several different ideas to consider about the viewpoint.

The point of defining disorders is so they can be looked at collectively across healthcare providers, researchers, and insurers. Etiology is not necessary to find before defining a disorder. For a disorder to be a thing enough people have to have similar sets of symptoms. Mental illness can come from multiple sources, your depressin can be genetics or a bad childhood or from chronic adult stress. And it's not correct to say anorexia and bulimia stem from body image issues. That's certainly the case for some but it's not a necessary feature. \n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is having a diagnosis doesn't absolve you of responsibility from your problem, it just means that medicine recognizes that it's far more difficult for you to overcome the problem with just the tools in your own head. Some people overeat and binge but can overcome the urge with their own mental resources, just like some people feel down but can overcome it with their own thoughts or habits. Likewise, bed just gives a framework for describing a problem many people have so we can give treatments. \n\nSecond Response: \nThe definition of disorder in the sense used in medicine:\n\n&gt;a disruption of normal physical or mental functions; a disease or abnormal condition.\n\nHere's a link to the DSM V and it's definition of BED\n\nhttp://www.dsm5.org/documents/eating%20disorders%20fact%20sheet.pdf\n\n&gt;Binge eating disorder was approved for inclusion in DSM-5 as its own category of eating disorder. In\nDSM-IV, binge-eating disorder was not recognized as a disorder but rather described in Appendix B:\nCriteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study and was diagnosable using only the catch-all category\nof \u201ceating disorder not otherwise specified.\u201d\n\n&gt;Binge eating disorder is defined as recurring episodes of eating significantly more food in a short period\nof time than most people would eat under similar circumstances, with episodes marked by feelings of\nlack of control. Someone with binge eating disorder may eat too quickly, even when he or she is not\nhungry. The person may have feelings of guilt, embarrassment, or disgust and may binge eat alone\nto hide the behavior. This disorder is associated with marked distress and occurs, on average, at least\nonce a week over three months.\n\n&gt;This change is intended to increase awareness of the substantial differences between binge eating\ndisorder and the common phenomenon of overeating. While overeating is a challenge for many Americans,\nrecurrent binge eating is much less common, far more severe, and is associated with significant\nphysical and psychological problems.\n\nNow the reason why it's a disorder is because it's associated with physical and/or psychological problems. If it's in the DSM V as a disorder, it's a disorder in the medical sense. Your objection to this seems to be not specific enough to address within this scope.\n\nBasically it's a disorder like anorexia because both cause someone to have a relation with food pathologically in such a way that is largely detrimental to their physical well-being.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses provided to the original post regarding Binge Eating Disorder (BED), we can compare them based on tone, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, and engagement with the original poster's concerns.\n\n**First Response:**\n\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** This response maintains an informative and empathetic tone, attempting to recognize the original poster's concerns while gently correcting misconceptions.

Life is fundamentally shit, but happiness is possible.\n\nFirst Response: \nI'll address each of your points.\n\n&gt; #1 Boredom is the default mood. Mere existence isn't enough to satisfy us, we constantly have to distract ourselves from boredom.\n\nI disagree. Humans are pack animals. If you are with your \"clan\" (friends, family, etc), you should not be bored. Most humans find enjoyment simply from being around people they like. If you do not, then you are in the minority. If you are alone, then you will feel boredom. This is because humans are not meant to be secluded.\n\n&gt; #2 Pleasure requires effort, suffering does not. I literally don't have to do anything to suffer from boredom and starvation.\n\nI disagree as well. For me, pleasure comes easily. I will talk to a stranger and get pleasure, listen to a song and get pleasure, eat a nice meal and get pleasure. There isn't much effort I'm putting in. When I'm not putting in effort, I don't feel suffering. If you have a good 2-3 hours of pleasure, 1-2 hours of alone-time shouldn't make you fail pain. Food is also easy to come by nowadays and is in abundance. That's not an issue, so it's worthless to discuss.\n\n&gt; #3 Suffering is more powerful feeling than pleasure. Is there an opposite to a cluster headache\n\nIn my opinion, you underrate pleasure. If your mother dies, you feel immense suffering. That's not because the value of human life weighs so much on your soul that you can't bare to see a person die. It's because of the all the pleasure that person brought you. You feel pain, because you miss the pleasure.\n\nIt's the same thing with a cluster headache. You underrate the good feeling of having a clear head and feeling \"normal\". Cluster headaches hurt so much because normal feelings are so good. With normal feelings in your head, you can come up with amazing ideas, formulas, etc that make you feel immense joy. You take that for granted.\n\n&gt; #4 The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.\n\nThe universe is not some sentient being with feelings. Saying that the universe doesn't care about you falling onto spikes is the same as saying the playground didn't care that you broke your arm while on the slide. The universe doesn't have feelings. Dying is a part of life. It is the equal to birth. Birth is the best thing that can happen to you and death is the worst. Sure, you could wish you were never alive to have never felt suffering, but at the same time, you would never have felt joy.\n\nI suggest you\n\n1. Read \"The Giver\". It's a children's book, but it's fantastic and tells a story based on your theories.\n\n2. See a psychologist. You seemingly suffer from depression or anxiety which is fixable.\n\nSecond Response: \nSuffering isn't the default, doing stuff is. \n\nMillions of years ago, we did shit to survive. We hunted wooly mammoths and looked for berries and stuff. \n\nAs time went on we discovered farming and we settled down, so we didn't need to do as much so we had more free time but we still had needs like shelter and friendship so we kept doing shit. \n\nFast forward to 2015, we still need to do shit but not as much. Exercise is an option not a fact of life. We don't need to look for berries we got Safeway, we don't need to kill a pig found in the wild, we just buy pork. We don't need to build a home we just rent it. We don't even need to go to a friends house or hear their voice to talk , we got texting, Facebook ect. \n\nMy point is that it is not the default to be bored, we have just been spoiled as a species. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response is more effective in engaging with the original poster's arguments and presents a structured, empathetic, and logically sound counterpoint.

Save humanity and suffer a lot of pain for a couple months (if you consider the very act of becoming human a bad thing, then let's say 30ish years) and go back to Heaven\n2. Not save humanity and stay as god forever\n\nProvided you're not completely cold and oblivious being, 1) is clearly the only logical choice here, you are trading an infinitely small piece of your life for saving an entire race that you created, why not? Compared to eternity the suffering is meaningless. It's like if for giving 1 cent to a person Bill Gates could save that persons life. Of course he would. Anyone would. You don't need to be pure goodness to do that, not even close.\n\nSo, what is the merit of Jesus sacrifice? \n\nFirst Response: \nI'm very much a wild man in my faith, I wander the whole world's ideas and beliefs in search of truth. I was raised as a (Presyterian) Christian but had to reject all of it at a certain point in life. My return to Christianity has been very much a surprise, and made possible by setting aside everything that other humans have told me about God and Truth... including the Bible. I do still read the Bible, and seek out the perspectives of others. I also read many, many other things.\n\nChrist's death is the least relevant part of my experience of the divine. It's a little irreverent to say that, but it is just where I am at. I have heard the explanations and sermons, *ad nauseum*, about why Christ's death was a big deal. There's a lot of history involved, for one, about the prophecies and emotional-spiritual undercurrents of the Israelite/Jewish peoples and their journey and evolution. It takes quite a bit of research to really grasp in its true extent, given how insanely long ago all of this happened. (The cultures and peoples in question, and the world in general, looked radically different. Plus there's a language barrier to overcome.)\n\nAlso there are theological perspectives, built and expounded upon since Christ's death, which some people are really into. Christ being a bridge between humanity and God, Christ's death absolving all sins, all sorts of things that I have listened to at some length over the course of my life. And these things are ok I guess. I like some more than others, connect with some more than others.\n\nBut compared to the living truth I have met, the living spirit of consciousness and Life, the weird and wild and true Grace that has flown into me, and taught me what friendship even means, and shown me love and intimacy beyond what I could have hoped for, introduced me to intimacy in the first place ....ahhh it's truly incredible. Indescribable! Compared to this experience and love, the knowledge about this very ancient event, the death and resurrection of the man named Jesus, is well, just knowledge. It's an incredible story, and good to learn, but it's a little weird I think to focus on it so much. \n\nI'm sure my perspective will change subtly over time, but Christians focus so much on death and sin... they do so in order to show how God saves us from them. But if that's the case, why not frame it according to that premise? Talk about life and grace! That's more like how the spirit is with me.\n\nJust, pure grace. Pure soul. Pure music.\n\nSo while I have, in a way, not directly addressed your claim, I wanted to share my experience. There is a living spirit, call it the living spirit of Truth, or call it God, or call it the elegant cosmos, but realize those are just sounds we make, little squiggles we write down that try to correspond to a much huger reality than can possibly be contained in mere squiggles, in mere perturbations of the air. This living spirit is a Great Friend, is a deep well of Truth, Light, and Love. Instead of trying to use 2000 year old information (which wasn't recorded very well at the time, which was notoriously and shamelessly edited by political bodies, which was copied over and over by scribes who introduce small but Telephone-like errors, and then translated once or twice across languages) to evaluate the nobility and admirable-ness of Christ or the spirit which filled the man, probe the here and now. Ask the living truth to show you its nobility. Ask Christ to show you here and now whether he is admirable. And, crucially, wait for an answer.\n\n(Though this can be done alone, you might need to find a counselor, priest, artist, weirdo, musician, sheik, guru, yogi, or shaman to guide you through the morass of thoughts and feelings that keep our eyes shrouded.)\n\nI highly recommend reading (or re-reading) The Chronicles of Narnia. Aslan is to me a better portrayal of Christ than that given by most of the New Testament.\n\nArt and peace and grace to you\n\nSecond Response: \nLet\u2019s start with your framing position!\n\nTo begin with, Jesus\u2019 pre-incarnate status as divine is (based on the biblical text) poorly understood at best (although John certainly though he pre-existed). Positions have been argued most vehemently both ways, but his pre-incarnate state is, to us, basically opaque. I\u2019ll not take a position here, except to say that the way you framed this question would have to be considered pretty speculative. Let\u2019s work with what\u2019s recorded, instead!\n\nTo talk about Jesus\u2019 sacrifice and why it might be important, you\u2019d have to talk about who he is, and what he represents. You\u2019ve alluded to this in your question, but what do we mean when we say Jesus is the Lamb of God, and why does that matter?\n\nJesus is the Messiah; that is, he is God\u2019s anointed (in the same way as Saul, David, and Solomon) to be God\u2019s king and representative to the Jews. There had been many, many other anointed in the past; every king of Israel was messiah. Jesus was claiming that office. The miracles of Jesus\u2019 ministry are in part signifiers of his credentials. That is, he\u2019s demonstrating that he actually is sent on God\u2019s authority.\n\nThe difference here is that Jesus is pushing for an expanded understanding of God, His law, and His kingdom. Jesus in the gospels is claiming to be the king who is prophesied to usher in God\u2019s kingdom and begin the rule of God on earth. His claims and stance, coupled with the miraculous signs like healing, caused a high degree of polarization in the contemporary Jewish community.\n\nThat said, let\u2019s take another look at your framing question, as it seems to be the foundation of your perspective. As you\u2019ve set it up, it kind of sounds like Jesus is saying \u201cHeigh ho, better pop off to Earth for a spot of the old redemption, what? Oops, pesky humans, with their crucifying! Well, back to eternity; at least the blighters have a chance now.\u201d\n\nInstead, let\u2019s take the text at face value and look at it as Jesus is recorded to have done. This is a man who should have been treated like what he was, a prophet of God, a king and Messiah, and the representative of God to man. If those things are true (and we\u2019re assuming they are for this argument), then respect and devotion are certainly appropriate responses. Jesus\u2019 entire ministry is him pushing people to a clearer understanding and a refined relationship with the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This would all have been well within the understanding and history of the contemporary Jewish culture Jesus was in. There\u2019s even precedent in the prophets for what Jesus was doing.\n\nNow, it seems clear that Jesus himself knew that he would be killed. He alludes to it throughout the gospels (I shall raise this temple in 3 days, etc.). When we get the garden of Gethsemane, however, Jesus is incredibly stressed. He clearly does not want to be crucified, to the point where he is sweating blood. This is where we can answer your question with more accuracy. Jesus is not doing this because he wants to or because it\u2019s easy. In fact, in the text, he\u2019s not even doing it to save humanity. In Matthew 26:39, he asks not to be killed, and says that he does this because  it\u2019s the Father\u2019s will.\n\nSo, whatever Jesus\u2019 pre-incarnate state, whatever else he might have done, however the kingdom might have manifested with his continued survival, in Christ\u2019s crucifixion we can understand the term Lamb of God. This is a reference to the lamb of the Passover, the sacrifice whose blood on the lintel will signify your obedience to the Lord, and thereby spare you from death. It\u2019s a reference to the Exodus, and God\u2019s salvation of the Israelites from bondage. In the same way, Jesus\u2019 sacrifice frees us from the bondage and slavery of sin.\n\nThe merit in the sacrifice is that Jesus, so far the only human being who lived as God intended (that is, without sin and prioritizing God\u2019s will),  is brutally executed *while doing God\u2019s will*. His life and the manner of his death signify and confirm his authority from God, and that empowers him to be our representative, at once satisfying to God as doing as an actual human ought, and understandable to us because he\u2019s from our context.\nJust to reiterate, in the Scripture Jesus is acting like a human. There are things he doesn\u2019t know. The power he uses is from God. He\u2019s scared at the prospect of his execution. These are not the traits of an aloof divine being going through the motions. For Jesus, it\u2019s not a sacrifice of no value, but a protracted and painful (and humiliating) death.\nThe next logical question is to ask why a sacrifice is necessary at all, and that\u2019s a tougher one to answer. From the old to new testaments, sacrifice and death are always used to redeem sin. My understanding is that it\u2019s an illustration of the seriousness of sin and its consequences, but I\u2019d understand if that answer failed to satisfy.\nAnyway, hope that helps. I really rushed through this; there have been books and books written on this subject. If anything was unclear or you\u2019d like more info, I\u2019m happy to expand on any details.\n\nTL;DR: Jesus wasn\u2019t a detached divine being, according to the text. His sacrifice was at great personal cost. He was God\u2019s representative and rightful king of Israel (indeed, all the world), and therefore should have been treated as such rather than being wrongfully executed. His perspective was not one of giving away 30+ years out of a million billion, but rather one of being God\u2019s faithful servant within a limited human lifetime. The merit in his sacrifice is that he did God\u2019s will in his life to the point of unfair death at the hands of those he came to help, and that makes his sacrifice sufficient to repair our relationship with God, from God\u2019s perspective.\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors influencing this prediction are:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains a more formal and academic tone, addressing the original poster's points directly and thoughtfully.

A neighborhood watch couldn't hang in Gotham, where the problem is primarily organized crime. They'd either be bought off, intimidated, or killed.

{"index": 419, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:All states should adopt laws similar to the \"Idaho Stop Law\" with regards to people riding bikes\n\nOriginal Post: \n**Final Edit: Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion! I'm pleased with how it went and the back and forth was impressively civil. Kudos! I awarded two deltas: one disputing my included claim that bicycles are more capable of maneuvering a rolling stop than cars, and one for a caveat that municipalities should have the option of restricting the law in certain zones where the dangers would outweigh the benefits. Continue the conversation! I'm ready for bed.** \n\n*This has been argued before, but the most recent iteration I could find was two months ago and I believe because:*\n\n*1. it is part of a major national ongoing discussion in transportation circles, and*\n\n*2. the post of two months ago used different reasoning than my own,* \n\n*It is worth revisiting*\n______________________________________\n\n**Background**: Idaho Statute 49-720, commonly known as the \"Idaho Stop Law\" or \"Idaho Yield Law\" is legislation allowing legal exemptions from stop signs and stop lights for people riding bicycles that was adopted in 1982. The full law can be read [here](http://legislature.idaho.gov/idstat/Title49/T49CH7SECT49-720.htm) for those interested. Paraphrased, the law states that any bicyclist approaching a stop sign must slow their speed and check for cross traffic, but may proceed without stopping if it is safe to do so. Additionally, bicyclists approaching a stop light must come to a full stop (defined as a \"halt of forward momentum\") and may proceed through the light forward or by turning onto a cross street in either direction if it is safe to do so and the bicyclist does not impede cross traffic.\n\n**My reasoning**: Having lived in Idaho (among many other places both densely urban and vastly rural) and having used a bicycle as my primary means of transportation for nearly 20 years in those areas, I believe the Idaho Stop, if implemented correctly, is not only the best compromise for all forms of traffic that share the roads, but is actually *beneficial* to all road users.\n\nThere are many reasons the law is beneficial to cyclists, from their perspective (taken from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho_stop#Positions)):\n\n* Because of the positive externalities of cycling, bicycle laws should be designed to allow cyclists to travel swiftly and easily, and this provision allows for the conservation of energy.\n* Current laws were written for cars, and unlike cars, it is easy for cyclists to yield the right-of-way without coming to a complete stop.\n* Because cyclists are moving slower, have stereoscopic hearing, have no blind spots and can stop and maneuver more quickly than cars, current traffic control device laws don't make sense for cyclists.\n* With the Idaho stop, at special intersections where lights are controlled by sensing equipment, there is no need to provide extra equipment for cyclists. *(This is a big problem)*\n* The usual law forces cyclists to choose between routes that are more efficient but less safe due to higher traffic volumes, and routes that are safer, but less efficient due to the presence of numerous stop signs. Allowing cyclists to treat stop signs as yield signs empowers them to legally make the safer routes more efficient.\n\nThese are all logical benefits to the cyclist. As such, they should be taken into account when making decisions regarding traffic infrastructure improvements. However, give the overwhelming task of replacing/improving infrastructure long since built primarily for motor vehicles, cyclists of my generation and probably the following as well require some compromises to be able to use the streets safely and efficiently as legal vehicles (yes, bikes are considered vehicles every bit as much as cars in every state.)\n\nThat said, I believe the strongest two arguments for why the Idaho Stop makes sense right now is not the benefit it provides to the cyclist exclusively, but the benefit it is to traffic flow in general. \n\n**1. Allowing bicyclists to proceed through intersections during red lights or at stop signs when it is safe to do so greatly reduces the number of bicycle riders who slow the flow of traffic through intersections.** \n\n**2. By allowing cyclist to get in front of traffic, they become more visible, and in so doing, safer.**\n\nThe Idaho Stop allows bicycles to remove themselves from the acceleration phase of a traffic cycle, when the speed discrepancy is highest between bicycles and motor vehicles, while simultaneously allowing the cyclist as a small, slow moving vehicle to move to the front of traffic making them more visible to all road users. [The only study done on the topic in Idaho](http://bclu.org/jmeggs-TRB-IDAHO-AUG10.pdf)(pdf warning) found the latter claim to be true as the number of injuries to bicycle riders in the year after implementation dropped by 14.5%, with no increase in fatalities. As for the traffic flow improvement claim, I have nothing to offer other than anecdotal evidence from myself and fellow cyclists who have practiced the law. I would be open to reading any studies demonstrating evidence to the contrary if they exist.\n\n**Conclusion**: Ultimately, I believe the best solution for all parties is separated infrastructure for cyclists akin to what is found in the Netherlands and other bicycle-friendly European countries, such as protected bike lanes, cycletracks, and protected intersections. Many jurisdictions in the U.S.A. are moving toward implementing these necessary improvements, but timelines for such a massive restructuring of traffic flow and accompanying reeducation period stretch on, quite literally, for a lifetime. Timeline projects for some projects are on the scale of 50 years. In the meantime, I believe people who chose to ride bicycles for practical purposes ought to be encouraged and protected in doing so and the Idaho Stop Law is the best example of a working compromise available while we continue to work toward a more permanent solution.\n\nI feel strongly about this argument and have spent years debating it, but I am always open to having my view changed if the right argument arises that I haven't considered. CMV?\n\nEDIT 1: A huge caveat required to make this practical is a strong educational program to accompany the law change wherever it is affected. Schools, news organizations, government agencies, and police would have to cooperate to educated all road users about the change. It is happening in Boise right now, and can be done.\n\nEDIT 2: A good number of responses are arguing that bicyclists already break laws and this would make them more likely. Contrarily, what has been seen in Boise is that with the advent of the law, police are free to ignore bicyclists behaving in law-abiding and safe manner, and freed up to target those who are actually putting others in danger. There is nothing inherent in the law that legalizes hitting pedestrians or cutting off cross traffic, and violators who do that can more easily be identified and appropriately cited.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

They're leaders and examples for youth, they're often able funnel money back into their communities for development, they're often better able to service their communities. Setting aside spots for them isn't meant to remove spots for white kids. It's not. Aboriginal students who make it to university often had to attend rougher schools on or near reserves. They're more likely to grow up in foster care. They're less likely to have university-educated parents.\n\nJust imagine that you're a highschool student living with your paternal grandmother - a woman who attended residential school. She didn't receive a great education - she probably left the moment she was able to because residential school was a shitty time for a lot of students and they got schooling that was far below the standards set for other students. When you're raised in an environment where school is a scary, violent, abusive force it doesn't necessarily breed the same academic support.\n\nThere are all these barriers that stack up together to make it really hard for them to get into the same programs.\n\nAboriginal special acceptance programs aren't meant to punish poor or disadvantaged non-aboriginal kids. They're simply meant to help provide clearer avenues for aboriginal students to access education.\n\nI think that's what affirmative action looks to do in the US. \n\nAffirmative action isn't perfect. You get advantaged kids in any race. But it's one of the best tools we do have for helping poor and depressed groups help themselves. Admitting their kids to universities helps them lift their communities up and that's worth the imperfections in the system. \n\nSecond Response: \nI think there is a lot that can be said about subtle ways in which Black and Hispanic students are at a disadvantage in the admissions process, and I agree with other commenters who are making this point, but I actually want to come at this issue from a slightly different direction.   Consider the admissions process not from the perspective of the student, but from the perspective of the college.  The college's job is not to find and admit the \"best\" or \"smartest\" students, whatever that might mean, but rather to admit the students who are going to benefit the college the most.  Most admissions officers, especially at elite private schools in the U.S., will readily admit this if asked.  You can argue that this is somehow \"unfair,\" but remember that the first and most important job of a college is to maximize its own ability to do high-quality education and research.\n\n\nAdmitting a racially diverse student body helps the college achieve this aim in a variety of ways:\n\n1. It helps attract a larger applicant pool.  Some students applying to college value \"diversity\" and will choose to apply to colleges with visible racial minorities preferentially over colleges that are dominated by White students.  Conversely, very few students will cross a college off their list because it is \"too diverse.\"  So the college has nothing to lose and everything to gain in terms of attracting more applicants if there's more visible diversity.  Colleges would always rather have more applicants than they can admit because then they appear more selective, and thus more prestigious.\n\n2. It keeps alumni and donors happy (who value the perception that the college is \"diverse\"), who will then give the college more money which it can spend on things like increasing the quality of its programs or providing more financial aid to needy students.\n\n3. It increases the number of student perspectives on campus, broadening the range of discourse in and out of classes and leading to a higher-quality education as students are exposed to a broader set of ideas and experiences.\n\n4. It gives the college a broader alumni base in communities other than those dominated by Whites and/or Asians.  This helps increase the college's general name recognition and prestige. \n\n\nI should note that this approach to the admissions process is typical of private colleges and universities (and a few top-tier public universities) in the U.S.  It is much less true of large state schools and essentially nonexistent outside the U.S.  However, it is these same U.S. private colleges and universities that are most likely to use affirmative action in their decisions, so I think the point stands.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor influencing my prediction stems from the second response's nuanced approach to the issue of college admissions, particularly from the perspective of the colleges themselves. This response adopts a clear, logical structure while presenting a variety of well-thought-out points that emphasize the broader benefits of racial diversity in higher education. It manages to cultivate an understanding of institutional benefits rather than focusing solely on individual merit, thus allowing the original poster to consider a wider context regarding affirmative action.\n\nIn contrast, the first response primarily focuses on the challenges faced by Aboriginal students in Canada, drawing from personal narratives but doing so in a style that could feel somewhat defensive about race-specific programs rather than addressing the broader implications of admissions policies as related to American institutions. While it offers an important perspective on the unique circumstances of Indigenous students, it may not successfully engage the original poster's preconceptions as directly as the second response.\n\nThe second response's use of numeric points also aids in readability, offering a structured argument that appeals to logic and reason. It frames the discussion around the institutional goals of colleges, which not only counters the original poster's assertions regarding merit-based admissions but also reframes the conversation in a way that is less confrontational. This indicates a greater likelihood of presenting a persuasive view to the original poster, prompting a re-evaluation of their stance on race in college admissions.", "is_correct": false}

{"index": 422, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: It's not \"creeping\", \"snooping\", or \"being a creeper\" to browse social media content that presumably was put there for exactly that purpose.\n\nOriginal Post: \n**Edit:** I didn't expect this to get such a response. I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Also, it's frequently thrown around in a sarcastic manner, or simply as a joke. \n\nThis really has to be broken down into a case-by-case basis, and even then, you might just be misunderstanding somebody.\n\nI will say that I think \"creeping\" is thrown around more casually these days in that specific context because of the ubiquity of social networks. *Everybody* has a Facebook page, and most people have so many Facebook friends that 80% of the content their friends post never even makes it to their timeline.\n\nSo with that in mind, depending on what specifically you mention as having seen on somebody's Facebook, that almost automatically implies that you put in an effort above and beyond simply becoming Facebook friends and passively monitoring your own personal timeline. It may be a trivial amount of effort, but if somebody becomes aware of the fact that you actively searched through their profile in particular, it is unsettling to some degree... again, this is highly contextual. Nobody wants to suddenly realize that the person they just became Facebook friends with yesterday poured through 5 years of their history and actually paid enough attention to bring up something that happened years ago. The actual act of quickly scanning a new friend's profile isn't really weird, but you have to admit, in a real life social situation, it's a bit awkward to bring something up from it that you weren't personally involved in that happened a long time ago. It just makes you seem like you're coming on really strong.\n\nAlso, I think in most people's minds, there is still a disconnect between social networks and reality. Sometimes it's just a bit unsettling to realize that everything you put on social media reaches a MUCH larger audience than you might have *really* intended for it to, harmless or not.\n\nSo there are a number of reasons for some people reacting negatively to bringing up something from a social network. I'm not sure that really changes your view at all, but it's an interesting discussion.\n\nSecond Response: \nOne problem is that neither Facebook nor humans have ultra fine ways of filtering their content. You might have a couple groups that you limit access to, but even that's quite a bit of effort and not very effective. \n\nSay you just become friends with someone. You likely weren't part of their lives in any meaningful way five years ago. You don't know that much about their personal history. They aren't the same person they were then either - they look different, hold different opinions and have a different assortment of friends. \n\nThere's nothing at all strange or off putting for my old friends from elementary school to visit my mom and look through her old photo albums. If someone I recently met did that, that would be incredibly disturbing. What are they really trying to get at? Do they think that this old content is going to give them insight into me and my life, and if so, that's a pretty high level of effort and personal engagement. \n\nFacebook has also changed *a lot*. These days it's very much about transient social interactions. Personal information is off the main page and pictures usually just get thrown up rather than put in organized folders. I'd argue that interactions, images and often even personal information on Facebook aren't nearly as good of a way to get a sense of someone as they once were. \n\nWhen you comment on an old item, you are usually doing it out of context.  Commenting publicly is also a performative public act, not a personal communication. \n\nStill, this also doesn't mean that there aren't people that need to chill. Some people literally consider it to be 'creeping' if you mention the things they've posted publicly to them in person. It's almost like they're so detached from their social media life that they don't fully identify with the person that generated and shared that content. That's stupid. \n\nSome people call any interaction with their public content by someone they don't like 'creeping'. No, you should unfriend or restrict them if you don't want them seeing your content or ask them to stop if you don't like their comments.\n\nBut the above arguments don't address those cases - they look at the cases where digging up old content be a real signal that someone's both extremely, perhaps worrisomely enthralled with your life and feels the need to respond to it performatively. Remember, it's not just looking when you Comment or Like - it's a public performance. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include the following:\n\n1. **Complexity of Argumentation**: The second response presents a more nuanced view of the situation, discussing the implications of social media interactions in greater depth.

I agree that in some cases, it is useful. Asking a user of the product what it's like doesn't introduce very much bias (although even then, you'd trust the average star rating of 1000 users over any individual review).\n\nThe problem is when you only hear about people who've had a certain type of experience. If you only listen to anecdotal accounts of whether prayer works, for example, then you'll get a very biased view, because nobody likes to talk about times when prayer didn't work.\n\nThere are ways to get around this, of course, but most of the time, if you're listening to anecdotal data, you're not trying to debias it, or weighing it properly; so it tends to have a disproportionate effect on your thinking.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe biggest problem with anecdotal evidence is that it's a self-selected sample. Generally people telling the anecdote have a *reason* for telling the anecdote, which amplifies the \"oddness\" of the results you get.\n\nE.g. people writing reviews for products are far more likely to write if they really hate the item or really love it than if they are just generally satisfied with it and it met their expectations. \n\nPeople talking about \"that one time they were at a bar and were able to pick up a girl with this one joke\" are telling that story not just *in spite* of it being unusual, but actually *because* it was unusual.\n\nThis an overgeneralization, but it's really pretty true:\n\nGood data is collected with an understanding of how it is sampled, and what the biases are in selection.\n\nBad data is collected by asking a broad audience a question, and only listening to the ones that choose to answer the question.\n\nAnecdotal evidence is like the latter.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe prediction that the second response successfully changed the original poster's view stems from several key factors:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a slightly more conversational and engaging tone, using relatable examples that directly address the original post's context, such as product reviews and social situations. This makes it more accessible and relatable, encouraging a stronger emotional understanding from the original poster.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response utilizes clear, explicit examples that illustrate the point about self-selection bias, such as the anecdote regarding individuals who either love or hate a product.

Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.\n\nI'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.\n\n[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.\n\n[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.\n\nBottom line:\n\nYou don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.\n\nEvery year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.\n\nIt might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?\n\nWell it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.\n\nIf you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.\n\nI'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.\n\n**Edited to link some sources**\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

There are no saints in this world. Everybody has an angle to help them in some way. \n\nThink about it. Snowden is in Russia right now after leaking secrets. What did that do? Hurt a spy program and angered people across the world. Now Snowden is safe in Russia and is with the Russian government. He works with them now and probably has no problem getting what ever he desires.\n\nThat's just an example of somebody that was praised as a hero on the Internet. I'm sure I could think of plenty more.\n\nTL;DR: You are being manipulated by the media into being angry and having beliefs molded. Not much has really changed, just adapted to modern times.\n\nSecond Response: \nI wonder how many of these people who changed your mind are actually working for the police or government. I mean they have people who's full time job is to create profiles on social media and maintain them and keep people's focus wherever they want it.

In contrast, the second response is more conspiratorial and accusatory, which might reinforce doubts without fostering constructive dialogue.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response uses personal experience to suggest an effective strategy for reassessment (taking a break from the news).

{"index": 425, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The US constitution and its amendments need to be re-written or updated and should be every 100 years or so.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThe constitution of the United States is over 200 years old and it shows its age. Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.\n\nI believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.\n\nWhat I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it. CMV\n\n---Edit---\nMany responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.\n\nTo CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV\n\n(also, deltas incoming for added info on the topic.

Maybe we should write it to the english level of a 4th grader? What about the illiterate population, it should be a video-edition because paper is so antiquated.\n\nIf it is unclear in any regard, that can be handled with amendments. Translating it risks losing meaning. You ever play that game where someone whispers something in someones ear and it get's passed in a circle and when it comes back it's a totally new word/phrase? That's what will happen if the constitution is re-written every X years.\n\nSecond Response: \nActually, the Constitution is sacrosanct IMO. Amendments are a suitable way of dealing with that level. What I would suggest is a 10 year audit for all legislatures, state and federal, to scrub their books for laws that are antiquated, written for special interests, or otherwise inadequate/poorly conceived. There are plenty of good examples [here](http://www.dumblaws.com/laws/united-states/alabama). I didn't choose Alabama as an example, they're just the first alphabetically. However they have examples that fit my suggestion quite well, I'd say, such as \"It is illegal to sell peanuts in Lee County after sundown on Wednesday,\" \"Dominoes may not be played on Sunday,\" or \"You may not have an ice cream cone in your back pocket at any time.\"\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response maintains a respectful and constructive tone, acknowledging the importance of the Constitution while offering a reasonable alternative.

In contrast, the first response takes an antagonistic and sarcastic tone, which may alienate the original poster rather than persuade them.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs rhetorical questions and specific examples (e.g., silly laws from Alabama) that illustrate a point about existing laws needing scrutiny, thus engaging the original poster's focus on the outdated nature of legal frameworks. The first response utilizes a reductio ad absurdum approach but does so in a way that minimizes constructive dialogue, focusing instead on hyperbolic consequences of rewriting the Constitution.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response engages with the original poster\u2019s argument by acknowledging their concern about outdatedness while offering a viable solution to modernize laws through audits. This shows an understanding of the original poster's perspective and provides a thoughtful counter-proposal.

{"index": 426, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Politicians (specifically Presidential election candidates) deserve to be taken out of context.\n\nOriginal Post: \nRecently, Hilary Clinton has been in the news ([x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/), [x](http://thefreethoughtproject.com/hilary-clinton-the-sight-black-man-hoodie-scary-open-minded-whites/)) after delivering a speech in which she said that \"for a lot of well-meaning, open-minded white people, the sight of a young black man in a hoodie still evokes a twinge of fear.\" Publications from across the political spectrum tore her a new one for this comment in perceived poor taste. The article from the Federalist was spread on tumblr, and eventually popular user katara [reblogged with the full context](http://hunty.us/post/125041947641/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) of the quote, and people started criticizing the people passing around the articles for taking things out of context / not doing their research.    \n\n(Here's where my opinion comes in.) I think that tumblr's reputation of false alarm and out-of-context sound bites isn't unique to tumblr at all, it's the way popular American media has operated for the last few decades- if not more. [Many](http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/09/18/just-the-scandal-of-the-week-or-a-turning-point/the-news-media-and-its-soundbite-culture) [people](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/byron-williams/our-sound-bite-culture-sh_b_93720.html) have discussed the \"sound-bit culture\" that becomes especially popular in presidential election cycles. Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.   \n\nSpecifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from [people](http://bleecake.tumblr.com/post/125130165347/hillary-clinton-lets-be-honest-black-men-in) who feel as though the media took her quote out of context. Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody- she's gone through 2 successful presidential election campaign as a candidate's spouse and this is her second presidential campaign as a candidate herself. She's been in more controversy over the years than anybody can keep track of. She's got almost unanimous support from the Democratic party, and lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers. So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically \"Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad.\" Surely, she knows people are only gonna take the first bit of that clip, and they're gonna run with it.    \n\nTo me, the fact that this \"quotable\" passed through all the levels of Clinton's campaign team is just an indicator of how little anyone working for Clinton (including herself) really gives a shit. She could wake up tomorrow and say she intends on starting a nuclear war with Iran, and she'd still get the Democratic nomination. Because of that, I think the media has the right (and responsibility) to challenge Clinton. A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.    \n\nWe (the American people) are not getting the candidate we want or deserve, because we keep tripping over ourselves to help out Clinton.\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

It is not something that can be properly discussed entirely within the context of a speech. Policy is not something that should be made or broken on the back of a couple of well placed sentences. \n\nSo to properly answer your question: \n&gt;So why in the hell would she deliver a speech with the sentiment of basically \"Black people are scary... is what a racist would say. Racism is bad.\" \n\nIs not even what she was saying. Her speech was rather saying, \"People have these little biases and racist thoughts, and we should constantly challenge these thoughts.\" Of course, it might be helpful to elucidate on what exactly she means with that. \n\nBut at the broader question at hand, when you say, \n&gt;Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites\n\nI think the consequence is that we've actually limited the public debate, and insulted our own intelligences in the process. \n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; Given that this is the norm for modern day news, I think politicians have a responsibility to avoid creating problematic soundbites.\n\nGiven that rape is the norm, I think women have a responsibility to avoid creating rape scenarios.\n\n&gt;Specifically, I think Clinton doesn't deserve the sympathy she's getting from people who feel as though the media took her quote out of context.\n\nRape victims don't deserve the sympathy they're getting from people who feel as though the courts are not on their side.\n\n&gt;Clinton has been a politician for DECADES, she's got more experience than practically anybody\n\nRape has been occurring for MILLENIA, women should know better\n\n&gt;lord knows she can afford good speechwriters and campaign managers.\n\nThe rape victim should have bought longer clothes and a handgun to ward off rapists.\n\n&gt; A good candidate is a candidate who's speeches can't be misquoted/taken out of context.\n\nA good woman is a woman who stays in the house so no one can rape her.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Both responses present a critique of the original post, but they differ fundamentally in tone, emotional approach, engagement style, and rhetorical techniques. Here's a deeper analysis:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n   - **First Response**: The tone is respectful and analytical. The responder acknowledges their own bias against Hillary while trying to engage the OP on a more constructive level. They assert that the complexities of racism can't be boiled down to soundbites, and seek to clarify Clinton's intent. They advocate for a broader understanding of political discourse.\n   - **Second Response**: The tone is confrontational and sarcastic. The responder employs a shocking analogy likening Clinton's situation to victim-blaming in cases of rape. This approach is intended to emphasize the absurdity of the OP's argument but can come off as aggressive and dismissive, which might alienate the OP rather than persuade them.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**:\n   - **First Response**: It utilizes reasoned argumentation, providing a counter-argument directly related to the OP's point. The responder frames their perspective by presenting the complexities of discussing racism, making their argument feel more valid and thoughtful.\n   - **Second Response**: The use of a reductio ad absurdum technique is evident, turning the OP's statements into extreme parallels to provoke a strong emotional reaction. While this could be an effective technique in certain contexts, here it risks trivializing the conversation and might come across as offensive.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**:\n   - **First Response**: The response is clear, well-structured, and maintains coherence. The thoughts flow logically, making it easy for the OP and other readers to follow.\n   - **Second Response**: While also structured, the heavy use of potentially triggering analogies creates a choppy reading experience. Each comparison is loaded with emotion, which can detract from the overall clarity of the argument.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**:\n   - **First Response**: It directly engages the OP by addressing specific points they've raised, framing the respondent\u2019s argument as a response to the OP's assertions. This creates a dialogic quality that invites further discussion.\n   - **Second Response**: Although it references the OP's points, it does so in a way that feels accusatory and less inviting for dialogue. This negative engagement could lead OP to feel attacked rather than challenged productively.\n\n**Prediction**: $$Answer: First Response$$\n\n**Explanation**: The key factor leading to this prediction is the respectful and analytical tone of the first response. Instead of dismissing the OP or taking an aggressive approach, it engages critically with the OP's views while acknowledging its biases. This method makes it more likely to foster reflection and potential change in the OP's perspective, whereas the second response's confrontational and sarcastic tone could alienate the OP, making them defensive rather than open to changing their view.", "is_correct": false}

If you have a nose that is 2 1/2 inches long and crushed in eye socket, then yes, you have an out. \n\nHowever, if you are not disfigured, and your facial syemetry is average, and you are still considered unattractive, well then it's your fault. \n\nAre you overweight? Your fault. \n\nDo you dress like a 35 year old male who still lives in his mom's basement, and wears black velcro shoes?  Your fault. \n\nAre you balding? Depending on the structure of your skull, this is debatable, but you can take steps to mitigate this that don't involve a comb over. Halfway your fault. \n\nDo you have acne? Take better care of your skin. There are some miracle acne drugs out there. Your fault. \n\nDo you only wear shit tier clothes every single day because their \"comfortable\"?

Your fault. \n\nDo you wear shit tier clothes every single day because you can't afford decent clothes? Work harder, go back to school, still your fault. \n\nLadies, do you not wear makeup because it takes too much effort to apply? Your fault. If makeup didn't work there wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar industry surrounding it. \n\nDo you smell like ass because you don't take a shower every day, use deodorant, and wear cologne/perfume? Your fault. \n\nDo you have a shit tier job because you have a degree in History? Your fault. \n\nMen, do you not shave your unibrow/nose hair? Your fault. \n\nNearly any excuse you can give for why you are unattractive is something you can control for and therefore makes it your fault. I do not presume to say that taking all these steps will make someone a 10/10 but if you are a 2/10, I firmly believe you can go to a 7/10. Everyone can be a 7/10 out of ten. Again, this bars physical characteristics that you have no control over. If you're a 4'10 male, it's not your fault, you just have shitty height genetics. \n\nAlso I am not saying being attractive is easy. It takes a lot of work and a lot of self improvement. \n\nFinally, this post isn't supposed to make anyone feel good. I am fully aware of how douchy it sounds. Spare me the hateful pm's.\n\nFirst Response: \nA lot of those things you mentioned (acne treatment, fashionable clothes, hair treatment, gym membership to lose weight) require money. Since being poor isn't the poor person's fault (in most situations), I'd say being \"unattractive\" because you can't afford things that would make you \"attractive\" isn't your fault. You might say \"they should work harder, go to school, and get a better job,\" but I don't think their looks will be the first thing they spend their new salary on.\n\nSecond Response: \nyou aren't 100% wrong, but the reasons you're wrong are significant, i think.\n\nfor now, i'm going to take it for granted that you meant people with average facial structures were entirely capable of making themselves more attractive at large. you seem to not quite take that seriously the idea of people with facial structures that are simply unattractive straight up and only talk about extreme cases, but i feel like taking this approach gets more to the spirit of your post.\n\nwhat i think is the key is to discuss the the fact that you said \"it's largely your fault\". not \"the causes are attributable to your lifestyle or choices\", or \"you played a significant role in it\", but \"fault\" implying that there's some blame involved, and there's some sort of responsibility to make yourself look more attractive. am i misinterpreting what you were getting at here? because \"it's your fault\" doesn't really feel like neutral phrasing. there definitely feels like some kind of lot of blaming going on here. \n\nyou don't seem to really take seriously however, the idea that a lot of these conditions, and whether or not someone acts on them, is not fully in the control of the person it applies to. you seem like the kind of person who'd say 'no matter your conditions, if you have a choice in the matter, and you don't take that choice, you are 100% responsible, and frankly, might be a pussy for not makign that choice', am i right?\n\nfor more clarification: do you think say, given any let's sat 3/10 person, and if you found the right clothes, exercise routines, hairstyles, maybe makeup routines and hygein practices, they could be generally attractive? do you think that would really hold up and that facial attractiveness that falls below average can really just be propped up by dressing up everything else?\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Both responses engage with the original poster's views, but they do so in different stylistic manners that influence their persuasiveness.\n\n### Comparison of Responses\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- **First Response:** This response takes a more pragmatic tone, emphasizing economic factors as legitimate hindrances to personal improvement. It maintains a sense of empathy towards those who may be financially struggling, suggesting that financial constraints make it difficult for some to take the actions the original poster recommends.\n- **Second Response:** This response is more confrontational and analytical, adopting a questioning approach that challenges the original poster's framing of \"fault.\" The tone implies a critique of blame and emphasizes the gray areas of responsibility, evoking a more reflective response from the original poster.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- **First Response:** Utilizes straightforward reasoning and logic, placing the responsibility on systemic issues like poverty rather than individual choices. It subtly appeals to fairness and justice, suggesting the original poster's view is potentially insensitive to financial realities.\n- **Second Response:** Employs a lot of rhetorical questions which invite introspection from the original poster. It challenges the original premise by dissecting the language used, particularly the use of \"fault\" and its implications, which can provoke a thoughtful reconsideration of the original stance.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- **First Response:** Its sentences are concise and clear, making it easy for readers to follow the argument. This clarity enhances its persuasiveness, allowing the core message about financial limitations to resonate without distraction.\n- **Second Response:** This response uses longer, more complex sentences and a more nuanced approach, which may be harder to digest quickly but serves to create a deeper dialogue. This complexity can invite reflection, though it risks losing some immediate engagement.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- **First Response:** Directly addresses specific points made by the original poster and refutes them based on financial circumstances, indicating a clear understanding of the original argument.\n- **Second Response:** Engages in a more indirect challenge, prompting the original poster to reconsider their own wording and implications. It fosters a dialogue about moral responsibility versus practical limitations.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation\nThe key factor leading to this prediction lies in the emotional and cognitive appeal of the second response. By dissecting the language and concept of \"fault\" and inviting introspection, it introduces a philosophical lens that can provoke substantial reconsideration of the original poster\u2019s views. The analytical questioning nature of the second response fosters a deeper engagement that challenges the original poster to reflect on their assumptions, making it potentially more effective in changing the original poster's perspective than the first response, which while valid, primarily focuses on the practical limitations of finances.", "is_correct": true}

From there, I concluded that heterosexuality and bisexuality would be the two most likely sexualities to be propagated (by some abstracted gene selection process) but didn't understand why the more restrictive option would be selected for over the less restrictive one.\n\nThe answer seems to be hiding in probabilities so if anyone can expand on that more I'm willing to give deltas. \n\nAlso, if you have a problem with my reasoning, please leave an explanation with your downvote so I can understand why it's off. \n\n---\n\nI struggle to believe that most human beings are naturally supposed to only be attracted to the opposite sex and are inherently repulsed by same sex characteristics. I think most people identify as straight out of convenience and having never needed to question what was assumed for them. I\u2019m not denying that heterosexuality is a legitimate orientation but I have not found convincing evidence against, for example, the possibility that most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there. \n\nThe only arguments I\u2019ve read for heterosexuality being default is the biological urge to have children, which I believe is neither universal nor exclusive to heterosexuality and the (imo fallacious) \u201cmost people are straight so there ***must*** be a biological mechanism that supports this phenomenon\u201d path of reasoning. \n\nI'm willing to give a delta to any argument that can demonstrate why heterosexuality might be more advantageous  or likely than bisexuality. \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nI think your title is a bit confusing. What you are asking it seems is if there's a genetic determination for heterosexuality. \n\nOne way to answer this question is to look at twins, because they have the same genome, but can have different environment if they are raised separately, they allow to distinguish between genetic and environmental effects with a bit of math. It seems people found a bit of genetic determination for sexual preference.\n\nAnother way it just to sequence the genome of a large number of people, and to ask them their sexual preference. If you have enough of these, and with a bit a of math, you can measure how much genetic factors determine a trait. It seems people have found genetic determinants of sexual preference, although the studies are still quite preliminary.\n\nYou can also look across different species, for example the genetic of sexual behavior of fruit flies is well understood. There's also some genes in mice that seems to control sexual preference.\n\nFinally one can look across societies, both contemporary and in the past. If something, like sexual preference is conserved across all societies, it's a argument for a genetic basis of sexual preference, because it rules out other environmental factors. I'm not sure about the answer here, but it seems to me that most societies are mainly heterosexual.\n\nNote that everything that touch reproduction is usually under strong selective pressure, because it affects fitness much more directly than other traits.\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology_and_sexual_orientation\n\nSecond Response: \nPeople keep responding with \"heterosexuality lets you pass on your genes, so it's better.\"  This is in great contrast to the more fundamental principle of the selfish gene as outlined by Richard Dawkins.  You are not what natural selection cares about: only genes are.  If a gene is reproduced, it is successful, regardless of whether or not individual carriers of the gene reproduce.\n\nThis explains why homosexuality is prevalent in animals.  Sure, a homosexual organism may not *personally* reproduce, but genes which contribute to that behavior may be distributed in a great many other organisms.  Most likely, those closely related to the homosexual one.  This means that a combination of genes which produce homosexual organisms with a reasonable frequency give us a collection of related organisms, in which some do not personally reproduce.  This is theorized to result in additional caretakers, improving the survivability of that *cluster* of organisms which mostly carry the genes responsible.\n\nSo natural selection can absolutely favor \"gay genes\"--you just won't find a stable population in which *all* organisms are gay (for obvious reasons).  But it seems that, for many social species, having these genes in the pool is better than not having them.  I.e., they are not actually selected against.\n\nBut you may have noticed a key point here.  Although genes which contribute to homosexuality (in combination, or with certain environmental factors, etc.) may be well distributed throughout the population, the system appears to work best when the number of dedicated homosexual organisms is a minor fraction.  To phrase it in inexact terms, about \"one per family\".\n\nAs a result, the most stable and successful population has homosexuality in the minority.  It is very important to understand that this does not make it bad, and in fact this appears to be better for survival of the collective gene pool than having no homosexuality.  So it's not weird, it's not \"selected against\", it's not an aberration, but it *is* a minority expression.  That's its optimum distribution.\n\nI would shy away from using the word \"normal\", which has a lot of connotative baggage, and go with the word \"typical\".  Heterosexuality in humans is typical, homosexuality considerably less so, and both contribute to our collective survival.  As we run up to a lot of population walls, and the population plateaus, the equation will change.  At that point (and perhaps we're already getting there), the optimum distribution of homosexuality may be higher.\n\nAside from all that, there's the matter of bisexuality.  Genetics and behavior are very complex, but when you consider the idea that there are various contributing genes which affect us in different circumstances to, in general, provide a baseline level of homosexuality in the population, it's understandable that many other people may *partially* express that orientation.  Certain aspects of homosexuality can coexist with heterosexual behavior, and so we have bisexuality.  Nevertheless, it seems that statistically the heterosexual behavior must be more common in the population for optimum performance.  So despite bisexual tendencies, heterosexuality is still typical, and more often expressed in individuals with some bisexual behavior than homosexuality is.\n\nYou could argue that someone who's even a *little* bit bisexual no longer counts as \"straight\", but if pretty much their entire history of relationships and actual sexual activity is straight, and they just happen to enjoy gay porn sometimes, I think it's reasonable to call them functionally straight.  If we divide bisexuality into \"mostly straight\" and \"mostly gay\", you'll see that straight+mostly straight is much more common than gay+mostly gay.\n\nAnd beyond all that, you propose that \"most humans could be predisposed to bisexuality and simply develop a preference of one or none from there.\"  Well, sure, but you have to realize that we're dealing with a gradient and not three distinct buckets.  We don't start in one bucket and then choose another later.  We have a complex and sprawling map of behaviors.  Our genetics contribute to which paths we take.  It appears that the most typical situation is that people stick to heterosexuality in most circumstances, even if certain circumstances would result in homo/bisexual behavior.  So straight is still typical, despite our potential gradient of behavior.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze the responses concerning the original post, which challenges the idea of heterosexuality being a default or normal orientation, we can break down each response based on stylistic elements.\n\n### Comparisons:\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach**\n- **First Response:** The tone is clinical and somewhat dry, focusing more on presenting scientific information and research methods. It lacks emotional engagement, which might make it less relatable to the original poster who is grappling with complex feelings and beliefs about sexuality.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is more conversational and engaging, using phrases that invite reflection (e.g., \u201cyou may have noticed a key point here\u201d). It acknowledges the complexity of sexual orientation and empathizes with the feelings involved, indicating a deeper understanding of the original poster's psychological struggle.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques**\n- **First Response:** The rhetorical approach is primarily factual, relying on scientific jargon and data-driven arguments, which may overwhelm the audience and detract from personal engagement. It doesn\u2019t sufficiently connect with the emotional dimensions of the argument.\n- **Second Response:** It utilizes analogy, referencing Richard Dawkins' concept of the \"selfish gene,\" which provides a framework for understanding sexuality within the broader context of evolution. This technique encourages the reader to think critically about implications and viewpoints rather than just presenting data.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability**\n- **First Response:** The response is structured methodically, employing complex sentence structures that may require closer reading and comprehension. It feels more like a textbook explanation than a discussion.\n- **Second Response:** The second response is generally more readable and easier to digest, comprised of shorter sentences and clearer explanations, which helps in conveying complex ideas more effectively to the original poster.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster**\n- **First Response:** It somewhat lacks direct engagement with the original views expressed by the poster, focusing heavily on external evidence without addressing their personal insights or concerns.\n- **Second Response:** It directly addresses the original poster's points and uncertainties, making specific connections to the issues they raised about social dynamics and genetics, leading to a more constructive dialogue.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Key Factors\nThe key factors influencing the prediction that the second response may have more successfully changed the original poster's view include the tone and emotional approach, which were more relatable and empathetic, fostering a sense of connection. The use of rhetorical frameworks enables the original poster to place their beliefs within a larger context, potentially promoting a reconsideration of their stance. Additionally, the second response's clarity and direct engagement with the user's points offer a more compelling argument that resonates better with someone wrestling with nuanced concepts rather than merely presenting scientific concepts without context.

There is no overlap; even the very best frozen pizza isn't as good as the worst pizza you can find in a restaurant.\n\nI have searched for years trying to find frozen pizza that's half as good as even Little Caesar's, but to no avail.

I just don't eat it.\n\nSecond Response: \nI will agree that frozen pizza can never compare to fresh pizza, but such is the case with any food. But I will disagree that no frozen pizza is good. In order to enjoy frozen pizza a three steps must be followed, add to the pizza, cook properly, eat hot.\n\n\n\n\nI happen to like red Barron frozen pizza. In order to bring out its full potential you have to add to the pizza, if you do not add to you will not get a good result. I will add fresh onions, peppers, and some kind of meat(ham, sausage, pepperoni, etc.) I will also add sirachi applied in a circle over the pizza. I will also keep garlic sauce in the fridge, from a pizza place, if I have any I will put a little of this on the top.

Here is a link to watch it if you haven't seen it yet: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhKAQX5izw\n\nHere is the gist of my viewpoint:\nIn the US, when a person is terminated from a job, he/she is entitled to unemployment benefits for up to 99 weeks or until they are employed again. Workers and companies pay into this and, while many people end up taking more than they give, it is the system we have and it seems to work for the majority of people here. When a person leaves a job VOLUNTARILY, however, they are not entitled to unemployment benefits. If you quit a job to go to another job this is fine. If you are quitting to go 'find' yourself in Australia for a year, you better have a financial plan because you can't live off other peoples' money for your vacation. This system also seems to work well for most people.\n\nIn the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.\n\nMy stance is that if having a child is a choice, it should be one the parents must prepare for financially before making - just like if they wanted to voluntarily take time off work for other reasons.\n\nWe have safety nets for people who are caught in situations they can't control. This is not one of them. Being a parent requires the ability to plan and budget anyway, and it includes many expenses that people will absolutely incur that will not be covered by the hard work of others. It should start with planning to be off work for whatever time having the baby takes.\n\nI completely support peoples' positions being protected while they are off and, quite honestly, think that length of time should be extended from 12 weeks to 24 weeks. But I REALLY don't like the idea of taxpayer dollars being used to support ANYONE who voluntarily leaves work - no matter the reason.\n\nChange My View.\n\nEDIT: I am also against he government mandating that companies provide paid maternity leave on simple Constitutional grounds. In the US the Constitution prohibits the government from mandating this. But I would LOVE it if companies started doing it voluntarily and think it would be a huge positive for attracting top talent. But it should be between employers and employees to figure out compensation packages. \n\n\n__________\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

This should both benefit the child's future and hopefully encourage people to have kids at a replacement level.\n\nSecond Response: \nFirst thought: Making sure new mothers and their child are safe, secure, and taken care of benefits society as a whole.  \n  \nWe are lacking in this category compared to other countries. If society as a whole were to voice their concerns about this we would see talks about it. In other countries that has already happened. They understand the benefit of taking care of their society as a whole far outweighs the taxes needed. I for one, would welcome a tax to ensure mothers are taken care of.  \n  \n&gt; In the US, abortion is Constitutionally protected under a person's right to privacy. The details of the laws vary from state to state but there is no place in the US where a person cannot legally and safely obtain an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.  \n  \nThis is false. Although it may be something that states should do, plenty have strongly opposed a woman's right to an abortion even going as far as to setup multiple road blocks to delay the process.  \n  \nNo one will advocate for supporting financially stable mothers for years. The whole point of maternity leave is so the mother can be with her child. Mothers go through many chemical changes in their body. Not to mention the massive toll physically and mentally that giving birth takes on the mother. Allowing the mother time to rest and be around her baby is a good thing. If this is her first child, even moreso as she has no idea what she is doing. Asking a mother to work days after she just gave birth is asking for trouble. She is not physically or mentally there. She just experienced a very traumatic experience and the body needs time to rest. All she will want is to be with her child. She may even be extremely stressed from not being to be there and I don't think her job should be able to terminate her because she wants to spend time with her new-born.  \n  \nAll in all, I am massively for paid maternity leave. This country is so far behind in taking care of its citizens it is becoming disgusting. We have one of the worst healthcare systems in the world, unless of course you are wealthy. We turn our backs on veterans that need medical care. We lock up and jail people with mental illnesses. We tell mothers that they're baby isn't important and that they need to suck it up and work.

Bill was President from 92 to 2000. Hillary's riding his coattails.  She fought tooth and nail during the 08 primary for the democratic nomination and lost fair and square to Obama.  She wants to throw her hat in the ring again, and that's her right.  Chelsea Clinton hasn't followed her parents into politics, aside from stumping for her mother, so it's unlikely there's a political dynasty in the making.\n\nThe Bush thing is more an anomally than a trend. George Sr. was a successful politician, was elected Vice President on the Reagan ticket from 80 to 88. (it's important to note that VP of the US has litte official power, just to cast the tie-breaking vote in the senate, and to replace the president if he dies), he was elected president from 88 to 92.  He had two kids that followed him in to politics.  I don't think there's much doubt that both benefited from their dad's name in early campaigns, but nepotism only goes so far.  His campaigns were orchestrated by political genius/satan incarnate Karl Rove, who knew exactly how to brand him, and ran effective smear campaigns in governor, primary and presidential races.  That is, his winning strategy was to make the opposing candidates look bad rather than bringing attention to his own.\n\nJeb on the other hand went the florida route.  He did his bachelor's in Latin American Studies and is fluent in Spanish.    he made a name for himself in florida politics and accomplished a lot, probably due to his own merits as much as the family name.  He's being tapped as a possible presiential candidate, not just because of his name, but because of his conservative voting record, he can appeal to traditional conservatives as well as (they hope) the Hispanic population, which is an increasingly important voting bloc, they are generally socially conservative but still vote more democratic.  However, unlike George W Bush, the family name and association with his brother may be more of an uphill battle in the presidential election. \n\nSecond Response: \nFirstly:  if you have a problem with either another bush or another clinton, you should have a problem with both.  Personally, I'm a republican so I hate Hillary, I should like bush, but I really don't want another bush in the White House, and as stupid as the republicans are I think they're smart enough to not try to put another bush in the White House.\n\nSecondly:  it's just our political system.  Forgetting names (because arguably we can take this to the \"first\" political dynasty in America with the Adams Family), how we elect a president is fair, and if the people vote for the dynasty, we will get a dynasty.  If the people vote for Marco Rubio, or Bernie Sanders, or Rand Paul, then the people will get one of them, we don't have to have a political dynasty.  Also, a little pointing out, the democrats are going to push Hillary, she's the strongest candidate they have, but there are too many people who don't like Hillary.  \n\nAnyways it's only a bad thing if the American people say it's a bad thing.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response has a more polished and persuasive style as compared to the second. It employs a calm, rational tone that engages with the original poster's concerns by providing a detailed analysis of the political landscape involving the Clintons and Bushes. The respondent uses a structured argument to break down the individual histories of the politicians, acknowledging the positives and negatives of their careers while also addressing the poster's fear of political dynasties. This reflective and informative approach makes it more credible and compelling.\n\nIn contrast, the second response uses a more confrontational tone, beginning with a dismissive remark that implies the original poster should be consistent in their stance. This tone can be perceived as aggressive and may alienate the poster instead of encouraging them to consider a different viewpoint. The reasoning is less detailed and somewhat oversimplified, failing to in-depth analysis that could effectively challenge the original poster's perspective.\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the first response's ability to engage thoughtfully with the original poster's concerns, while providing context and counterarguments in a respectful tone. The second response, though asserting a different opinion, lacks the depth and congeniality that could lead to a change in perspective.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 434, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Edward Snowden should be pardoned.\n\nOriginal Post: \nSnowden leaked classified information, which is a crime, but the circumstances of the leak, and how he did it, are such that he deserves to be pardoned.\n\nSnowden did not leak for personal gain, but for public benefit.  He did not sell secrets to a foreign power.  The programs he revealed [were illegal](https://www.eff.org/files/2015/05/07/aclu_v._clapper_-_court_of_appeals_opinion.pdf).  If he had not been a national security employee, his actions would have been covered by the whistleblower protection act, and not be a crime at all.\n\nTwo years on from his leaks, it is clear that Snowden has not acted in a way deserving of legal punishment, and it would be better for the United States if he were to be pardoned and allowed to return home, instead of his looming prosecution, especially considering that [he could not raise a public interest defense](https://freedom.press/blog/2013/12/if-snowden-returned-us-trial-all-whistleblower-evidence-would-likely-be-inadmissible) at trial.  \n\nSnowden broke the law.  But the pardon power exists precisely because the law does not cover all possible contingencies, and there is supposed to be the possibility of mercy in an exceptional case.  Snowden's case is nothing if not exceptional, and he should be pardoned.\n\nEdit:  Ok, I'm heading to bed now.  Thanks for all the responses, I'll try to catch up on more tomorrow - this thread kinda blew up on me.\n\nEdit 2:  I've awarded a delta to /u/MrApophenia who convinced me that the first-best solution would be for Snowden to return to the US on the condition, which he's publicly agreed to, of a trial where he can raise a public interest defense.  If convicted at that trial, a pardon might still be considered.  This would require an assurance that the espionage act charges be permanently dropped.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I mean, I am sure he would take one, but that isn't what he is asking for.\n\nWhistleblower laws in the US allow for people to break the law by revealing government information, and avoid punishment if they can show they did so for the purpose of the public good. The problem for Snowden is that these laws explicitly exclude intelligence agencies, and that under the Espionage Act he is charged with, he cannot make a public good defense.\n\nSnowden has said repeatedly that he would come back and face trial if he were allowed to defend himself as a whistleblower in court. So the government doesn't even need to pardon him to get him to return from Russia - simply charge him under something less draconian and anachronistic than the Espionage Act, and let him make his defense. (Presumably the case would look a lot like the debate in this thread.)\n\nSecond Response: \nMy personal opinion is that Ed should not be convicted of his (obvious) crimes, since his actions were quite clearly for the public's benefit. He also handled himself very well - the guy is clearly a very smart cookie.\n\nIf his case is presented in court it could, since it would get *massive* worldwide coverage, lead to a change in whistleblower laws in the US. Right now the application of the law, especially if anything is applicable under the Espionage Act, [puts a muzzle on whistleblowers who release information in the public's interest](https://freedom.press/blog/2014/01/sen-schumer-wrong-snowden-would-be-barred-arguing-his-case-trial). The courts are not immune to public pressure, and especially in a case like this it could lead to meaningful change.\n\nIt's one possible reason to not pardon Ed right away.

{"index": 435, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: There is not enough evidence of the safety/efficacy of vaccines, especially in the face of controversy and conspiracy\n\nOriginal Post: \nBoth my parents are heavily anti-vax and none of their 3 kids have been vaccinated. After leaving the nest I realized just how uncommon this was, however after years of being in the main stream, I'm still not convinced that vaccines are all they are cracked up to be. \n\nBetween whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.\n\nNow I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.\n\nPlease change my view.\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;  Between whistle blowers (William Thomson, Scott Cooper, Andrew Wakefield etc) and corruption within the vaccine industry, it seems like something sinister is afoot. There are countless horror stories and it seems like everyone just shuts up about these things and keeps thumping that vaccines are the greatest.\n\n\nThe problem with this argument is that it is open ended and not grounded in a fact or idea.  It is as hard to dispute it as it is to dispute the comment *\"I am scared\"*.  \n\nWhistle-blowers are essential to keep groups honest.  It doesn't mean that the whole system is better off gone.  It only means that there are more flaws than an entity would otherwise acknowledge.  I'm not familiar with everyone on the list, but considering that Obama immediately granted William Thompson immunity from any crimes for testifying clearly indicates that we're not looking at a conspiracy. He spoke out and he was encouraged to do so.\n\n&gt;  Now I'm not antivaccine (although I haven't been immunized yet) I'm just not pro vaccine. I haven't seen enough to discredit this dark side of things and show undoubtedly that vaccinations are the way to go.\n\n\nAs /u/amazingmrbrock pointed out in what might be deemed *the laziest CMV comment in history* there's more at stake than what you can plainly see.  Specifically Herd Immunity.  That means that we are communally protected from diseases because they are less prevalent.  So for instance, babies younger than 1 year old or the elderly with weakened immune systems may not be able to be vaccinated.  However the lack of prevalence of the disease in society makes it that they are still safe.  So being vaccinated is not just about saving your life but it is about saving the lives of others around you.\n\n\nSeparately, it is important not to look at public policy from an empirical perspective.  Everyone will always know of a story about someone who suffered in some way.  This only points out that a system is not perfect, which was never really in contention. The only question is if the system is better than the lack of a system.  Which *statistics* do a much better job at proving.  Looking at the [Anti-vaccine Body count](http://www.antivaccinebodycount.com/Anti-Vaccine_Body_Count/Home.html) we can see staggering numbers in preventable diseases and deaths.  \n\nIf vaccines caused autism or had similar effects, then surely it would be measurable in a similar way.  We could reconcile that data against each other.  But in the absence of facts, horror stories take it's place.  I can see how gory details are more moving than a chart, but it doesn't make them more accurate.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe problem is there are thousands of vaccines in the world, all with their own specific goal, their own specific ingredients and therefor their own specific interaction with the human body. Saying vaccinating is a bad idea because some may or may not cause negative side effects is akin to saying that eating is a bad idea because some people have bad reactions to certain foods. It is nonsensical.\n\nYes, there are undoubtebly some horror stories out there about cases where vaccination may or may not have played a role. And that is absolutely sad and horrible for the parents involved. But the inevitable result of introducing a foreign object (the vaccine) into the human body is that somebody, somewhere is going to have an adverse reaction to this. In the end, life itself is inherently risky and we can never eliminate all risks. I myself am terribly allergic to walnuts. Give me a handful and I'll be dead before you can call an ambulance. In the US alone it is estimated there are over 15 million people with food allergies (1 in 20), yet how many parents will have their children tested before giving them their first peanut butter? I would guess none. Why? Because the risk is thought to be minimal. Yes, there might be countless horror stories, and some of these might even be true, but billions of people have been vaccinated over the years. Compared to that number, even if all these stories are true, means that there is virtually no risk whatsoever. A child is far more likely to die from eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich than from getting complications from vaccinations.\n\nNow a lot has already been said about the actual health dangers to vaccinations, I could add to it, but instead I'll direct you to a very informative video by Potholer54:\n\n[Health, vaccinations and junk science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ZZTjChW4o)\n\n(Potholer54 is a journalist who regularly makes videos debunking junk science, I suggest you check out his channel).\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction are the engagement level and the logical structure provided in the First Response. The first responder addresses the original poster's points directly, employing a calm yet assertive tone that seeks to dismantle the overarching narrative of vaccine safety concerns with grounded arguments. They utilize rhetorical techniques, such as analogy and contrast, to argue that the existence of whistleblowers does not negate the validity of vaccines but instead indicates the necessity of oversight within health systems. \n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of statistical references and information about herd immunity offers additional persuasive elements that appeal to the poster\u2019s request for evidential support. The response not only presents factual evidence but does so in a way that articulates empathy toward the original poster's concerns while simultaneously providing a clear rationale for vaccination.\n\nIn contrast, the Second Response, while containing valid points and providing an anecdote about food allergies, lacks the same engagement with the original post. The approach seems more defensive and generalized rather than directly addressing the main concerns raised by the original poster. It does not build on a dialogue as effectively, making it less likely to change the original poster's view.\n\nOverall, the First Response\u2019s combination of logical reasoning, direct engagement, and factual support renders it more likely to have successfully influenced the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": false}

Also my rhetoric is not going to be nice because its sort of half a rant too. I guess this is directed at a sort of liberal/progressive crowd, but can apply to right wing people too.\n\nEver since atheism and anti-theism movement sprung up on reddit we have been bashing it. Some of those reasons was correct. I believe atheists used too much rhetoric such as \"free thinker\", \"skeptic\", \"reason\" and \"logic\" to push their agenda. And we used to (USED TO) have neckbeards spewing some obnoxious shit. And i agree they come off as cringy. But in general, mockery of religion is fun, really fun and FAIR! We laugh at bullshit ideas all the time.\n\n\"im an atheist but please be tolerant, let them believe\" or \"People believe different things\" or something similar.\n\n-We have such an agenda of tolerating christians because in the west because the majority is still christian, this also influences \"tolerant atheists\" subconsciously\n\n-We tolerate Islam because \"that is the religion those people in them middle east believe in\" so it would make us racist to criticize it. Like i get it Fox news is racist, but i dont have to be racist because i critizice Islam. Its like the people who try to tolerate Islam somehow think its racist to criticize it, failing to see that there is a diverse spectrum of people who believe in Islam and not just middle eastern people. Calling people racist for critizicing Islam is such a high level of mental gymnastics that i cant even. \n\n-We cant critizice Jews because that would make us literally Hitler. (I actually understand this one though)\n\n-Mormons are made fun of, but mostly they get the same treatment as christians \"let people believe what they believe\".\n\n-We dont respect the views of other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc.\n\nBecause?\n\nThey are not a majority, nor taught to us before we could write. That is what i think most people choose to ignore. We dont have people spewing tolerance of religion because we have some genuine need to spare someones feelings. Its because christianity is popular, based on faslehood and people feel like their beliefs are under attack.\n\nWhen was the last time you saw someone going out of their way to defend a person who claimed to be a wolf? Oh, wait they get laughed at and mocked universally. Guy claims to believe hes literally drinking the blood of christ? Someone mocks him and gets labeled a fedora neckbeard.\n\nLike seriously if someone tells you they believe in unicorns you can probably laugh in their face like \"HAHAHA, you believe that?\" and no one would bat an eye. However, have long debates where you try to go into detail of the problems surrounding religion and trying to debunk it? Richard Dawkins and speakers like him get called intolerant. As if a desire to uphold truth is somehow wrong because people get their little feelings hurt.\n\nThe way i see it religion is as fake as astrology or unicorns. But there is no one defending the latter. Religion is bullshit with good PR. I would prefer to keep laughing at people who think they are wolfs, but with a world where no one is trying to pretend like religion needs some sort of handicap from society to not \"hurt precious feelings\". I should be able to find religion absurd without being labeled \"Euphoric\" or \"fedora wearing neckbeard\". \n\nI wish we could call out bad ideas no matter how many people believed in it. I want eqaulity when it comes to mocking things. The way i see it now religion has some sort of taboo of criticism that is protecting it. The way i want our society to change its view is  for people to watch all three videos  below and laugh. Just for the sake of equality. Sincerely, i live in Norway so i recieve minimal damage from religion. I just wish religion did not have to have some protective shield and having it be taboo to criticize it because they will cry the loudest when mocked.\n\nPeople mocking stupid beliefs:\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtH7l-dhHZQ [1]\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlMiKrwCRQ0 [2]\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea6w3zp-dYY [3]\n\nPenn Jillette: Why Tolerance Is Condescending\n\n-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpNRw7snmGM [4]\n\nWhat would change my mind is either:\n\n-A huge amount of people going out of their way to prevent people from critizicing bullshit ideas such as Astrology, para-psychology etc. (people can believe what they want, tolerance, does not hurt you)\n\n-A huge appeal to mock christianity from its own communities.\n\n-Some source proving society not having a total hypocritical view of what bullshit ideas we are aloud to mock and not\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

What is gained? If someone is directly or indirectly harming another person: yes. Those ideas should be shot down. Mocked. Removed. But what if I believe that God started the universe. Science cannot say how the universe started. It simply can't. The Big Bang theory does a fantastic job of telling us what happened RIGHT AFTER the universe was formed. But nothing during or before. \n\nSo, my belief that a god propogated the event that forms the universe does nothing to color the way I see science or treat people.

But I just don't see \"religion\" as the issue. I see douchbaggery as the issue. \n\nSecond Response: \nReligion is unique from the examples you listed (other-kin, astrologists, parapsychologists, flat earthers etc.) in that, at a basic level, it deals with spiritual, non-physical elements that science cannot explore. The ideologies you list are entirely and easily debunkable by modern science.\n\nThe idea that there's powers that cannot be observed be humans isn't scientific, and can't be proven or disproven, so it's really up to you if you want to believe it. If you think it's ridiculous to believe in something you can't prove, hey, I understand. But either way, the fringe ideologies you mention *can* be proven wrong, so it's far more nonsensical to believe in those than it is to believe in religion. Thus, it's reasonable for there to be more tolerance for religion than for ideologies that can be factually proven wrong.\n\nAnd while I do understand that religion is far more than just a belief system in greater spiritual powers and actually have positive and negative affects on society, I'd argue that the negative criticisms toward those negative affects have existed. Yes, it's appropriate to criticize Islamic extremists who wish to cause undue harm, but it's inappropriate to extrapolate that group to the whole of the Islamic faith (as many are want to do). It's very easy, when we're talking about Reddit/society in general, to mix up these two actions, but both of these happen.\n\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the second response's effective engagement and nuanced understanding of the original poster's viewpoint.

Benefits are not removed until the a second round of testing occurs after a time frame that would allow the initial results to have left the body. \n\n4.

It's plausible that there are people who are unemployed because they can't pass a drug test. Maybe instead of testing all applicants and potentially wasting lots of money, you could track the job search progress of applicants and require them to report the results of drug tests those employers administered.

{"index": 439, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The majority of minute silences are insincere and are just empty gestures.\n\nOriginal Post: \nToday marks the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 bombings in London. To commemorate this there has been a supposedly nation wide minute silence. While I wouldn't interrupt a minute silence I do think that they are arbitrary and not a good way of \"showing respect\".\n\nUsually they are touted as a way of remembering victims of tragedies, however as someone who lives across the country, I do not know the victims or any of their family and as a result other than the circumstances in which it happened, their deaths have little to no effect on my life. Because of this, I think it is disingenuous and borderline offensive to those close to the victims for me to pretend that I am actively upset by their deaths.\n\nIn addition to this I said that minute silences are arbitrary; millions of people have died in  the ten years since, some of them in similar circumstances even yet 99.9% of those will go \" unremembered \". Surely by not holding a minute silence for at least the people who died in terror attacks we are tacitly implying disrespect? One could argue that it should be something carried out only in the home country of the victims which would not explain why the whole world continues to hold minute silences to commemorate 9/11.\n\nI am not saying that there should be a blanket ban on minute silences however. For example it recently made the news that there was a minute silence in the stadium before a football game to acknowledge the death of a fan. I wholeheartedly support that as it shows a community (either his literal, local community or the community of football fans) coming together to show solidarity for someone who's death may well have personally affected many of them. \n\nI apologise for the wall of text and any spelling mistakes due to mobile typing.

I think it is more about showing solidarity with a collective rather than for the comfort of those directly affected, and I think that can be quite beautiful.\n\nThat said, there's an unfortunate political opportunity in these kind of things. I'm uneasy in moments like these, knowing that this solidarity is often exploited to achieve some unsavory political goals. Politicians in Israel, the UK, and the US are guilty of this. Politicians everywhere are guilty of this.\n\nSo yes, while these moments are easily tainted by a select group of people, I believe there's an undeniable beauty to them. I think there's an insincerity to this moment commemorating the holocaust--it's no secret that Israel doesn't have the best track record on human rights and Israel's past has been used to justify those actions--but even if the moment is leveraged for political gain, there's still something hauntingly sacred about it. That might make it worth experiencing.\n\nSecond Response: \nSo you support it to create/reinforce a sense of community, but to an extent, the entire nation (and increasingly the globe) is a coherent community. Droughts and fires in California don't affect those on the east coast, but does keep people aware of the larger situation.\n\nSimilarly, the closeness doesn't matter. In your example, almost no one in the stadium knew about the fan or who they were or were going home to a different social environment due to loss. Even worse, those who instigated the moment of silence knew the victim as a *revenue stream* and not much more. They were seeking to reinforce loyalty to their still existing revenue streams.\n\nMeanwhile, I have the same rationale as you to not desire participating in a moment of silence if someone in my own town dies if I don't know them well. \"But I might know those affected!\" Sure, and you might know people dealing with Canadian fires, or those who have relatives that went on an unfortunate vacation and we're attacked by extremists, or people whose family are trying to extend help to their relatives in Greece. Hell, you might even just be a person that wants to plan a vacation. Maybe I won't go to Canada while it's burning. Maybe I want to go somewhere I can lend support (morally, emotionally, or fiscally) while in an foreign state/country.\n\nIs it arbitrary? Yes, but it doesn't matter because (1) I don't think there is an objective way do pay respect; and (2) it doesn't matter what you are doing- what matters is that the event is in your mind. Hell, it doesn't matter if your mind is thinking \"This damn 7/7 shit is bullshit\" because that thought keeps the event in your mind. Maybe you *do* visit London, for whatever reason. If you see more stringent security in action than you might have expected, or a memorial, you won't look like a fool when you act in ignorance of the circumstances behind these things. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "In analyzing the two responses to the original post, some key elements stand out in terms of stylistic approaches, engagement, and emotional resonance:\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach\n- **First Response:** The tone is somewhat philosophical and reflective. The responder acknowledges the original poster's (OP's) viewpoint while offering a broader perspective on national identity and the collective mourning experience. The usage of emotional words like \"beautiful\" and \"hauntingly sacred\" indicates a more sentimental approach.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is logical and somewhat critical. The responder questions the arbitrary nature of minute silences and focuses more on an analytical approach than an emotional one. Phrases like \"revenue stream\" suggest skepticism toward the motivations behind commemorative gestures, which may alienate rather than engage.\n\n### Rhetorical Techniques\n- **First Response:** The use of a video link suggests an appeal to authority and emotional storytelling. The responder connects personal feelings to broader themes of national identity, aiming to evoke empathy from the OP.\n- **Second Response:** The responder employs a causal and comparative reasoning technique, using analogies related to tragedies outside of the OP's immediate experience. It leans more on logical reasoning without an emotional anchor, possibly making it harder for the OP to connect with the argument.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability\n- **First Response:** The sentences vary in complexity and maintain a consistent flow, which aids readability. It structures thoughts in a way that they build on each other, making it easier for the OP to follow.\n- **Second Response:** The response contains longer, more convoluted sentences that occasionally may detract from clarity. The argument structure is less straightforward, which could potentially confuse the OP.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster\n- **First Response:** Engages with the OP's initial context of the post and builds upon it, addressing their feelings about minute silences while also emphasizing collective mourning that transcends personal connections.\n- **Second Response:** Addresses the OP's example of local mourning but seems more focused on challenging the validity of the OP's viewpoint, which might come off as combative rather than supportive.\n\n### Prediction\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n### Explanation of Prediction\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the emotional resonance and empathetic approach of the first response. By validating the OP's feelings while also introducing a broader perspective on community and collective mourning, it likely creates a more relatable and engaging experience that can subtly shift the OP's view. The philosophical underpinnings and acknowledgment of beauty in these moments of silence allow the original poster to reflect on their perspective without feeling dismissed. In contrast, the second response's argumentative and critical tone could prompt defensiveness rather than open-mindedness.", "is_correct": true}

Greece *has* implemented the demanded austerity measures for the last couple of years (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_government-debt_crisis_countermeasures) for all the boring glory). In fact, that's a big part of the problem! Those austerity measures drove the Greek economy deeper into recession, which is largely what increased the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio (after all, when GDP goes down, debt-to-GDP goes up even when debt stays constant).\n\nThe Eurogroup position is basically that of a doctor who sees that bloodletting fails to cure the patient, and therefore prescribes even more bloodletting.\n\nFor the less factual and more political things wrong with that sentence:\n\n&gt; defaulting on its debts and becoming a failed state\n\nA Greek default does not mean Greece becomes a failed state - look at Argentina for a good example. Of course, if Greece had exited, the rest of the EU may have been pushed by Merkel and Sch\u00e4uble to start an even more vicious and open economic war against Greece. But let's be honest here: of course a more powerful state can turn another state into a failed state out of spite or stupidity (see Afghanistan in the last 50 years for an example of the latter).\n\n&gt; The alternative (...) is \n\nThere are and have always been other, better alternatives. Years ago, when the first haircut on Greek debt was decided, an investment plan for Greece could have been implemented to grow the Greek economy.\n\nActually, that would have been the *smart* move by the creditors, because it would have increased the changes that they would get paid back. Now that Greece remained on the course of austerity, it looks as if another haircut will be needed (see the recent IMF reports, for example).\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;But they have been outspending their means\n\nThe United States government, which holds highest possible bond rating and whose currency is view as the safest in the world, has run a deficit for most of the last 50 years.  There isn't anything inherently wrong with deficit spending, and many economists believe government spending is the best way to lift countries out of recession.\n\nThe problem here is that Greece is tied to the Euro.  They cannot simply print more money and increase exports by devaluing their own currency.\n\n&gt;they can't reasonably refuse cuts to their public spending that they can no longer afford\n\nThere are good economic reasons to believe that austerity will *not* improve the Greek economy.  While the rest of the Eurozone has climbed out of the recession of the 2008 economic collapse, Greece's GDP has continued to fall as government spending falls.\n\n&gt;why blame the eurozone for trying to help\n\nTheir view is that the Eurozone *isn't* trying to help.  The only reason they gave bailout loans in the first place was to keep Spain, Ireland and possibly Italy from freaking out at preemptively leaving the Euro as well.  Now that the danger has passed for those countries, Greece is being bent over backwards, basically being forced out.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the Second Response's empathetic and nuanced approach.

{"index": 441, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: In a capitalist society, it is completely reasonable for men to make more money than women.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThis is naturally an incredibly controversial topic and I highly doubt that many people will agree with me, but I feel compelled to discuss this. \n\nThis needs to be prefaced by saying that all of this is based on averages, not individuals. I'm sure many women are more capable than many men, what I'm saying is that the general trend across the board is that on average a male worker is more productive. \n\nMen work almost triple the amount of overtime hours than women.\n\nMen work more standard hours than women.\n\nWomen take more sick days off work than men.\n\nWomen are more likely than men to take several years of maternity leave off of work.\n\nA small percentage of women undergo severe PMS and consequently work at a diminished capacity for several days of each month.\n\nTo use anecdotal evidence, yesterday i came in to work, to find that all 8 garbages were completely filled. This was strange, since the closing crew is supposed to take out the garbages every night. I asked my coworker why no one had done the garbages last night, and I was effectively told that only girls were working the closing shift, and none of them wanted to touch the garbages because they thought it was gross. So I had to take out 8 garbages first thing in the morning, because I was a man. Additionally, the parking lot was overflowing with trash that had spilled out of the over-packed garbage cans, but none of the girls had done the usual nightly responsibility of sweeping, since they thought it was a man's job as well. I'm not talking about one or two co-workers here, there were 7 women on shift, and every single one of them followed this gender stereotyped idea of what closing responsibilities they should have. Its one thing if men and women divide tasks based on relative strengths and weaknesses, but if someone neglects to do a task because there's no one of the opposite sex to assign it to, that is ridiculous. When only men are closing, someone still ends up washing the dishes and shining the countertops. \n\n\nDue to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women. \n\nWhat I find most surprising is that when I bring up this issue, I am met with incredible opposition, as if I am trying to oppress women or promote sexism. The truth is, an entire branch of feminism exists for the very reasons I have stated; socialist feminism believes that men have a higher capacity to work and are therefore at an advantage in a capitalist society. They believe the only way wage equality can happen is through instating socialist policies that ensure employers are forced to pay men and women equally. \n\nI am not saying that women *deserve* to be paid less because they have children for example, humanity needs new people to be born , and as such women should not be penalized for taking time off work to raise children. However, we do not live in a moral democracy. We live in a capitalist democracy, where employers are free to pay their employees whatever they think is proportional to the revenue or work that each specific employee will bring to the company. On average, certainly not always, but on average, men can generate slightly more work and revenue than women. \n\nThus, the only way women can achieve equal pay is through socialist change in legislation. \n\nFirst Response: \nThat is literally not what socialist feminism is. Or at least that's not what Marxist feminism is. Marxist feminism asserts that women were made subservient to men, by men, for the interests of capitalism, and that the oppression is so tied to capitalism that, even if you somehow eliminated it, you'd still have oppression along other lines (race, sexuality, etc) that would potentially be worse than before. Therefore dismantling capitalism is the only way to end oppression.\n\nAmong the left, the idea that women's oppression is solely derived from biology is an idea pretty much only believed by trans exclusionary radical feminists, a particularly small and terrible movement. Heck, in early hunter gatherer tribes, gatherers, who were mostly if not entirely women, provided upwards of 80% of the food.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;Due to the biological, sociological, and psychological factors that women face, they are on average less suited to performing excessive labour, and in an economic system where more work = more money, it is no surprise that men make more than women.\n\nWell, more work does not necessarily mean more money.  Especially when womens' participation [tends to be undervalued relative to its importance for success](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/opinion/sunday/sheryl-sandberg-and-adam-grant-on-women-doing-office-housework.html?_r=0).  Although you've listed a number of reasons that women might be expected to add less value, you're falling victim to the problem noted in the above link.  You're focusing on those negatives and ignoring the ways in which women tend to add more value than men.  [Another NYT piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/07/opinion/sunday/adam-grant-and-sheryl-sandberg-on-discrimination-at-work.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Opinion&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article) on gender in the workplace included the following paragraph, I would recommend that you read the rest as well.\n\n&gt;When more women lead, performance improves. Start-ups led by women are [more likely to succeed](http://www.dowjones.com/collateral/files/womenpe_report_final.pdf); innovative firms with more women in top management are [more profitable](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.1955/abstract); and companies with more gender diversity [have more](http://asr.sagepub.com/content/74/2/208.short) revenue, customers, market share and profits. [A comprehensive analysis](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2014-15222-001/) of 95 studies on gender differences showed that when it comes to leadership skills, although men are more confident, women are more competent.\n\nWomens' lower earnings cannot be explained as the result of differences in biological or psychological capacity.  If such factors explained the difference in pay, we would expect to see higher pay for women in leadership roles than for men - after all, it looks like they're objectively better at it.

{"index": 442, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The government should NOT be able to force businesses to serve customers/cater events the business does not want to serve/cater.\n\nOriginal Post: \nSo neither side of this debate feels morally right for me to be on, but I think logically, I'd have to support the conservative side of the argument.\nAll modern economic transactions involving physical items (no stocks, capital, etc.) can be simplified down to a trade of money for labor. Yes, you can buy an item off the shelf at someplace like Target, but what you're really buying is the labor involved in making that item, the item being the end result of it. In other words, it is impossible to buy a physical item that is not shaped and made valuable by labor. In this sense, what you do when you walk to a pizzaria and buy a pizza is *directly* contract the labor of the pizza maker in exchange for money (as opposed to indirect contracting through a store, e.g. DiGornios). Because of this, businesses should have the right to refuse to labor for any particular individual, *for any reason*. If this is NOT the case, and some outside authority can force a person to preform labor they don't wish to preform, that could be seen as a type of slavery (I hate to use the term), because an outside authority is forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.  \nSo prove me wrong everyone, help me come to better formulate and understand my own ideas! That's what this sub is about, after all.\nPlease excuse the weird grammar and sentence structure, I just woke up\n\nFirst Response: \n\"It's the cost of doing business\". \n\nIf a business owner doesn't like their clientele, they are more than welcome to simply stop doing business. (Main difference from slavery is that business owners can walk away.) Alternately you can stop doing business with the general public and become a private store/club instead and only serve your members. \n\nNon-Discrimination laws are no different than being required to accept currency, building handicap accessible buildings/accommodations, or even not being allowed to be open during certain hours. In the areas that have them it's simply part of the environment of doing business in that area. \n\nWhat the argument boils down to at an individual level is \"I doan wanna.\". (It may help to imagine that said in the voice of a pouty 3 year old to get the full effect. \n\nOn a more macroscopic scale it boils down to whose \"rights, responsibilities, and or privileges are more important\". In the cases alluded to the responsibility of the public shop owner is to serve the public. If they posted that they didn't do certain designs (like a confederate flag or a swastika or a burning cross, or effigies of presidents for example) and then refused to do that design, they would still be serving the public and not compromising whatever artistic/workmanship integrity they have. That's fine. \n\nBut to arbitrarily refuse service to certain members of the public is not. \n\nEven without legal rationale... if you open your business, skills and talents for hire in a community... then you need to accept the business of all of the community. Not just the parts that you like. Because if we allow businesses to do that as a community, it tears apart the community. \n\nThis isn't to say that you can't have standards such as a dress code which theoretically anybody can meet, or income requirement etc. But those aren't based on who somebody is. Just what they happen to have at the moment. \n\n\nSecond Response: \n\"...forcing a person, under the threat of force, to labor, even when that person doesn't want to.\"\n\nThis type of thinking, which can also be used to call taxation theft, only makes sense from a hyper-individualistic perspective.\n\nThe key to understanding laws like these is to think in terms of \"the public good.\" Almost any successful business drives away similar businesses in the area. For example, in a small town, there is likely to be only one hardware-store. So the question becomes, if the population can only support one hardware-store, is it important that that store be willing to serve all of the members of the community? A business which practices active discrimination in who they are willing to serve actively hurts the public good. It drives people of the group being discriminated against out of the community.\n\nSo the question becomes, which liberty is of greater value, a business owners freedom to discriminate or an individuals liberty to procure goods and services? Only in the USA, where our culture is obsessed with individualism, is this a real question. \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "**Analysis of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone is somewhat confrontational yet playful. It utilizes sarcasm (\"I doan wanna\" in a pouty voice) to highlight the childishness of resisting non-discrimination laws. It mixes humor with seriousness to tackle a sensitive topic, which can engage the original poster by making them reflect on their stance in a less rigid manner.\n   - **Second Response:** This response has a serious and academic tone. It presents a more logical analysis of the issue, focusing on the implications of individual liberty versus community welfare. The emotional appeal seems weaker than the first response, as it prioritizes reason over humor or personal engagement.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques:**\n   - **First Response:** Uses analogy and hypothetical situations to illustrate points (e.g., the comparison to a pouty child). This approach is effective for making complex ideas relatable, potentially resonating with the original poster's own experiences.\n   - **Second Response:** Relies on logical reasoning and constructs a dichotomy between individual rights and communal welfare, which invites the reader to think critically about the implications of their views. However, it lacks the engaging rhetorical devices found in the first response.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n   - **First Response:** It has varied sentence lengths and a conversational style, making it more approachable and easier to digest. The casual tone invites discourse, making it feel less like a rebuttal and more like a discussion.\n   - **Second Response:** This response is more formal and structured, focusing on clarity and logic, which may make it easier to follow but could also come off as dense or academic, perhaps distancing the original poster.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n   - **First Response:** Actively engages the original poster by directly addressing their points and framing the argument in a relatable way. It seeks not only to disagree but to expand the original poster's understanding.\n   - **Second Response:** While it does engage the poster's argument, it does so from a somewhat distant perspective, discussing 'the public good' rather than fostering a personal connection with the issue. This might make it feel less inviting for a personal viewpoint shift.\n\n**Prediction:** \n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n**Explanation of Key Factors:**\nThe first response successfully blends humor with serious points, providing relatable examples that could resonate more with the original poster's mindset. Its conversational tone and rhetorical strategies encourage a personal reevaluation rather than merely presenting a counter-argument. By engaging the original poster more effectively and addressing their emotional experience, the first response holds a greater chance of shifting their perspective.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 443, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Cultural appropriation is not something to be feared and it's not racist.\n\nOriginal Post: \nFirstly- I'm a Brit, so if I'm missing some massive cultural point of order here apologies!\n\n\nWhile having a conversation over the phone about a movie (the name of the movie never came up, so I will preface this post by saying I haven't actually seen said movie) in which a black student at an Ivy league school started a radio station directed at \"White People\", during this conversation a couple of things came up such as how the black students disapproved of a house of only black students being changed in the future so that students would mix normally (which sounds to me like an attempt to abolish outdated segregatory measures- although again I haven't seen the movie).\n\n\nThis is the context of my post- apparently this film culminates with a party in which people are invited to show up dressed as stereotypical elements of culture framed in an attempt to trap the students into going to a party founded on fundamentally racist ideals. The movie then ends with clips from colleges over America having these kinds of parties. Now I can't imagine many people are foreign to party themes which now could be labelled as cultural appropriation- the most common being \"Cowboys and Indians\" which are nowadays quick to be labelled as **racist**. \n\nI guess I come to the opinion in my title from several ideas which probably all need to be challenged to change the view to which they lead. \n\n1- Displaying stereotypes for any purpose (even one as basic as to have a good time) ultimately does no harm, causing offense or even in extreme cases devaluing the root culture (although I would dispute that) is not the same as racism which is a prejudice against another person due to the colour of their skin- there is no discrimination here, other than bruised feelings no harm is done, Stereotypes are used in comedy against pretty much every imaginable definable group. \n\n2- Britain (arguably more so than America) is a cultural melting pot, appropriation goes both ways- India started playing Cricket for example, the person I was on the phone with raised the point that appropriation is particularly when something is taken from a culture without giving a contribution back to the culture from which it was taken- which makes sense. However I would argue that the use of stereotypes in this way is not taking anything from the culture in the first place- stereotypes only occasionally reflect current cultures often far removed from the circumstance of their use. It would be like arguing against a BDSM theme for a party because we are taking from that sub-culture without contributing anything (Before people jump out and point out the strawman here those involved in the BDSM community have faced a persecution and prejudice for their activities which although are changeable- which skin colour is not in most cases the basic premise is still close enough to be metaphorically accurate) \n\n3- Cultures benefit from cultural appropriation- it raises awareness and increases immersion in the native culture. \n\nCMV\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns?

That's not really cultural appropriation.\n\nPeople get bent out of shape about it when people take bits and pieces of a culture out of context, without understanding it. Then, usually, those contextless items are commodified without the originating culture's consent or benefit.\n\nImagine the following scerario: some aliens decide to drop in on humanity, and they decide to wear coture dresses with pope hats and sneakers because they like keeping their jimmies cool, value comfort, and that's just a nice hat. Everybody everywhere would be snickering at their choice, but they would haughtily remind us that they are the more advanced species, so they are doing it right. Meanwhile, they take their dresses and pope hats back to the central galaxy and make more money than the earth is worth on their \"fantastic artisanship\" that they totally didn't just take directly from a Payless store. Earth remains disconnected from the galactic sphere, and all the dubbed virtual reality simulations they *do* send us back portray aliens dressed up as \"humans\" in their dresses and pope hats, and we all like cheese because the aliens found that hilarious. Those coture dresses are dismissed as 'tribal costumes' and we are the backward butts of jokes -- not the people who wore a damn pope hat and sneakers and called it 'cool'.\n\nOkay, so that's pretty absurd, but that's exactly what we tend to do to other cultures right here on earth.\n\nTo bring it back to your original BDSM party example, if people culturally appropriated from BDSM culture, it would suck. It would consist of taking things out of context, not caring about the important underlying things that make BDSM safe(r) and getting it (likely deadly) wrong. People would end up going to the hospital because they didn't know how to tie the ropes right, and didn't think it important to learn how before their hand turned black from constriction or something. They'd do things like wear a locking gag without having a safe command (like, \"hey spotter, if I pound my fist three times, that means break out the emergency shears and get this thing off me!\") so they end up choking to death. Now, everybody forms the opinion that BDSM is unsafe and should be banned, because just look at what happened!? *Obviously* that culture has something horribly wrong with it. That's cultural appropriation. Playing cricket worldwide is not.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think you are misunderstanding the point of cultural appropriation.  It's not that only a member of a given culture has any right to use objects, designs, patterns, etc. that come from that culture.\n\nThe biggest problem is when other people borrow one piece of a culture without taking a moment to understand context.\n\nA prime example is the [war bonnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonnet), as it's frequently appropriated.  \n\nIn reality, a war bonnet is an object with deep cultural, or even spiritual importance.  They're used almost exclusively for ceremonial purposes.  The feathers aren't just given away, they're earned by acts of valor, or other service to the tribe.\n\nWhen people wear them just as some sort of [fancy hat](https://www.google.com/search?q=war+bonnet+hipster&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=839&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIkeC0naXCxwIVCBGSCh3Q1wn-), that shows a deep lack of respect for another culture.  It's not just that you're taking an object, it's that you couldn't be bothered to even simply understand what that object actually means.\n\nIt would be somewhat similar to someone from another culture coming along, and deciding they like the way our western [military dress uniforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army_uniform#/media/File:Household_Cavalry.jpg) look, right down to the sword and the medals, so they were going to go wear that to a party.  Not only would they probably get a lot of the details wrong, they're unintentionally pretending to be something they're not, and pretending to have earned an honor they haven't.\n\nThe other type of culture appropriation might be closer to what you're saying is ok, but I believe it's still a problem.\n\nIt's when people try to imitate a culture, but fail so miserably that they end up creating a caricature instead.  This is what you're talking about with things like \"Cowboys and Indians\"  parties.\n\nWe can imagine what if people did the same thing with British culture.  What if everybody's idea of a British person was Dick Van Dyke's character from Mary Poppins, stupid accent and all?  What if every time you met someone, they had to make some stupid joke in a Cockney accent, because that movie was the only thing they knew about your culture?\n\nRight now, that Dick Van Dyke stereotype exists, but it's different from more problematic stereotypes for one really big reason, which is that no one actually believes it's true, not really.  People have a huge amount of exposure to British culture, with TV shows, movies, news, and music made by British people introducing people to other aspects of British culture all the time.\n\nThe cultures that have problems with cultural appropriation don't have that big advantage.  Often the vast majority of the exposure they get is in the form of stereotypes, which means they're always fighting uphill against misconceptions and misunderstandings in order to actually give any sort of realistic information to others about their culture.  How much do you know about Native American culture from the United States that didn't come from old Westerns, bad Halloween costumes, or other culturally appropriated sources?\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the **depth of engagement with the original poster**\u2019s views and the **clarity of the arguments** presented in the Second Response. The second responder begins by addressing the original post directly and rephrasing its points to clarify misconceptions about cultural appropriation. They provide a specific and relatable example (the war bonnet) that illustrates the deep cultural significance of certain symbols, which enhances understanding and reinforces their argument.\n\nConversely, the First Response, while creative and imaginative in its analogy, relies heavily on an absurd hypothetical scenario that doesn't directly connect with the original poster's cultural points or provide concrete examples of cultural appropriation. This abstract approach can distance the reader from the argument, making it less persuasive. \n\nOverall, the Second Response effectively empathetically addresses the complexities surrounding cultural appropriation and contextualizes its arguments with specific examples, increasing the likelihood of changing the original poster\u2019s view.", "is_correct": false}

Even if you're living in an area where you could live your entire life speaking your mother tongue, it doesn't make sense to not at least do the bare minimum to adapt.

As the global outrage over his actions showed us, it was however completely immoral.\n\nWell, let's start here with the question of how you're defining \"moral\" or \"immoral.\"  You seem to be adopting a kind of \"if enough people are vocally against it\" standard for this first part, but is that really your system of determining was is moral?\n\nIf so, how do you know the number of people who actually were okay with his actions and simply didn't say anything, and that the apparent overwhelming opposition was really just a smaller number of more outraged people?\n\nEssentially, you seem to be treating volume of the voices for the number of voices.\n\nSo let's say 51% of the world population was okay with it (a silent majority, to be a bit hackneyed), would that mean his actions were moral?\n\nOn the other side, as recently as 2013 a majority of Americans opposed gay marriage, did that make gay people who did get married in that year immoral?\n\n&gt;Another example: bankers. I read in a book that bankers that are considered \"professional\" disregard their own morals as much as possible and instead try to do as much as is legally possible. Immoral bankers and brokers are a core part of why the 2008 crisis was able to happen.\n\nIn most professions where one represents the interests of others there is an ethical obligation to do what is best for one's clients within the bounds of the law, rather than doing what you would consider morally best.  While also true of bankers this is exemplified in doctors or lawyers.\n\nAnd how are you determining whether the bankers actually *did* act immorally?  You seem to be taking that for granted here, but other than \"there was a bad outcome\" have nothing indicating they actually acted immorally in their specific roles.\n\n&gt;I think it's up to us to be aware of this and never use the law as a moral compass. Please, change my view.\n\nWell, okay, but the dentist in your first example did believe he was acting morally (since otherwise he wouldn't have done it).  His argument that it was legal is not an argument that he felt it immoral but did it because it was legal, but rather that it was legal and so no one else can force their morality on to him.\n\nYour argument doesn't seem to be \"we shouldn't use law as a moral compass\" (since the dentist probably *does* have a moral compass outside of law, but one which includes killing lions) but rather that anyone whose moral compass does not go above and beyond what the law requires is immoral purely by virtue of not being closer to your moral code.\n\nWhat if my moral compass says \"I got this seat first, and I don't give a damn about that old lady\"?  That's not using law as a moral compass, that's having a moral compass which does not require me to give up my seat and there not being a legal requirement to do so.\n\nWhich is really all a moral compass represents: what behaviors do I believe I should engage in, and what behaviors should I not engage in, within the bounds of the laws which I must abide by.  Which means neither the moral compass of \"let the old lady take my seat\" nor the moral compass of \"fuck her I don't want to stand\" is using the law as that compass.\n\nSecond Response: \nYou're examples all lean towards the side of someone doing something bad, and justifying it because it was legal. However, if the law shouldn't be your moral compss, then you have to look at it in the other light as well. What if people are doing things that the law considers bad, but they consider morally upright? Are they entitled to act on their own moral reasoning rather than the ones the elected officials of our nation have considered? If other people are influenced by your actions, should they really be controlled more by the whims of your own conscience than representative of our community? For example, let's say you think it's not morally reprehensible to kill a drug dealer because they impact many lives negatively through their occupation. Is it morally right for you to act on your own moral logic, disregarding entirely what your community's moral logic has asked of you? Isn't it best at times to acknowledge that while you may have a conflicting opinion, you are not a god and your personal beliefs may be secondary to the larger community's moral beliefs if it affects other people in your community?\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Comparing the two responses to the original post reveals several key stylistic differences:\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The *First Response* adopts a more analytical tone. It questions the original poster's (OP's) arguments and assumptions, pushing them to consider different perspectives on morality. This could come off as challenging but not emotionally charged.\n- The *Second Response* leans into a more confrontational and rhetorical tone. It engages with hypothetical scenarios that evoke emotional responses, urging the OP to consider the implications of using personal morals against community standards.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- The *First Response* employs a critical questioning style, using rhetorical questions to dissect the OP's examples. This serves to engage the OP logically, but it may not resonate emotionally.\n- The *Second Response* uses hypotheticals to provoke thought and a sense of larger social responsibility. By presenting extreme scenarios about community morals versus personal morals, it amplifies the emotional stakes and engages the OP on a personal level.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- The *First Response* features complex sentences with embedded clauses, which might require more effort to parse. The style tends to be more formal and structured.\n- The *Second Response* has shorter sentences and a more straightforward approach, making it more accessible and easier to follow, which can enhance its persuasive effect.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- The *First Response* primarily critiques the OP's definition of morality and circumstances without fully addressing the broader implications of personal versus legal morality. This creates an intellectual barrier where the OP might feel defensive.\n- The *Second Response* directly addresses the OP's argument by flipping it, asking them to consider how others might view morality differently.

{"index": 447, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Children who do not get 1st-3rd place DO NOT deserve a trophy for simply participating\n\nOriginal Post: \nHello CMV,\n\nI am not a parent but curious as to get your opinions to CMV. I grew playing competitive soccer (worked my way up to the competitive teams from your basic youth teams) and never once received a trophy for simply participating or losing. You either got 1st, 2nd, 3rd or you got nothing it was simple as that. By losing and not being rewarded we understood we had to try harder as an individual and try harder as a team to win. This led me to become much more competitive because I wanted to earn that trophy and be on that competitive team.  I really dont understand the idea of rewarding everyone for not winning, it's almost like saying \"hey, even if you dont try you still win\". I hear stories about teams that go 0-13 in a season and the kids walk away with a trophy, why?  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a cold hearted person and love to see all children happy but I dont understand the concept of rewarding someone for losing or not trying hard enough will result in a prize. To me that just teaches a kid that NOT giving your best will still result in a prize. What lesson does that teach you when you grow up? That your failure or lack of effort will be rewarded regardless of how you performed? Doesn't that give the child a bad mentality growing up? Personally if I had a kid and he/she played a sport I wouldn't allow the coach or a parent to give them a trophy for simply participating, I would make them understand that a reward/trophy is earned by hard work and dedication. I know not all kids are athletic but I still dont understand the concept or idea. \nWe all know reality is a bitch and life is going to hit you with some hard lessons so why not teach your kid that hard work pays off? Again, I am not trying to sound cold but I just dont understand the concept of rewarding \nfailure/losing, CMV......\n\nEdit: thanks for all the answers, feedback and insight. Many of you helped CMV. Again, I hope I didn't come off as cold or inconsiderate. I have younger cousins and love to see them succeed in anything they do, especially sports. I was more interested in having a discussion as to \"why\" and the mentality behind it. Many of you made valid arguments and gave me some great insight. I'm happy to keep discussing if people are interested but please note I am not against the idea but was more interested in helping me change my view of it. If anything please continue to give your children positive feedback, effective communication, motivation and let them know that team work is a great thing. I recommend everyone put their kids in sports (dont push them into it but help and guide them into something they love doing or are very passionate about). It really does pay off when you get older and helps them build some self confidence and understand the dynamics of a social environment. Thanks again everyone! \n\nEdit 2: Since the discussion continues, I think children under 12 should only get participation Trophies. Once you hit that age you should be teaching your kids the fundamentals of structured team work, effort and the idea that life will not reward your for simply showing up. Giving participation trophies to kids 13 and above is not a good life lesson. If you care to continue CMV on that! \n\nEdit 3: Thanks everyone for the continued conversation, input, points of views and personal experiences. This sub is great for people who are curious as to get the other sides opinion and everyone should keep an open mind about changing their view on the matter. Now some last bit of advice for coaches and parents who put their kids in sports. PLEASE keep your eye out for the that one un-athletic kid who might not be the best on the team and make sure that his/her team mates understand this is a team event and that everyone is in this together. Some of these personal experiences shared with me shed some light on how people hated playing sports  and were being bulled because they were that kid and the other kids made them feel left out. Not all kids will be good athletes but you can teach your kids to respect one another, support one another and to ensure that they understand the unity of team work. If your kid is that \"all-star\" on the team then make them understand this most because the other kids will look to him/her to see how they treat the rest of the team. A good leader will understand this and this habit will grow with them, you just have to show them how and why. Thanks again for all the input, this is a great sub. \n\nFirst Response: \nOther people are already addressing the fact that giving prizes for participation doesn't devalue victory, so I am going to go at this from a different angle. This is simply another overblown moral panic, children know participation trophies are utterly meaningless. The only people who give a damn about them are the few parents who think their kids will be devastated if they don't get a trophy and the current generation of zealots who are obsessed with their duty to decry obvious moral decay and are absolutely certain that *this* is truly the herald of societal decline (ignore the warnings from all previous generations). \n\nEvery generation is convinced that the next one is taking us down the shitter, surely you remember the Rock and Roll panic? D&amp;D? Video games? To quote Margaret A. Blanchard \u201cParents and grandparents who lead the efforts to cleanse today\u2019s society seem to forget that they survived alleged attacks on their morals by different media when they were children. Each generation\u2019s adults either lose faith in the ability of their young people to do the same or they become convinced that the dangers facing the new generation are much more substantial than the ones they faced as children.\u201d\n\nThere are examples throughout history suggesting this or that is a sign society is failing:\n\n&gt; Dancing a Waltz:\n\n&gt; The indecent foreign dance called the Waltz was introduced ... at the English Court on Friday last ... It is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs, and close compressure of the bodies ... to see that it is far indeed removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females...[Now that it is] forced on the respectable classes of society by the evil example of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.\n- 1816\n\n&gt; Living in cities:\n\n&gt; Never has youth been exposed to such dangers of both perversion and arrest as in our own land and day. Increasing urban life with its temptations, prematurities, sedentary occupations, and passive stimuli just when an active life is most needed, early emancipation and a lessening sense for both duty and discipline... \n- 1904\n\n&gt; Film:\n\n&gt; ...[The screen artists'] beauty, their exquisite clothing, their lax habits and low moral standards, are becoming unconsciously appropriated by the plastic minds of American youth. Let them do what they may; divorce scandals, hotel episodes, free love, all are passed over and condoned by the young... The eye-gate is the widest and most easily accessible of all the avenues of the soul; whatever is portrayed on the screen is imprinted indelibly upon the nation's soul.\n- 1926\n\n&gt; Chess:\n\n&gt; A pernicious excitement to learn and play chess has spread all over the country, and numerous clubs for practicing this game have been formed in cities and villages...chess is a mere amusement of a very inferior character, which robs the mind of valuable time that might be devoted to nobler acquirements, while it affords no benefit whatever to the body. Chess has acquired a high reputation as being a means to discipline the mind, but persons engaged in sedentary occupations should never practice this cheerless game; they require out-door exercises--not this sort of mental gladiatorship.\n-1859\n\n&gt; Fancy Umbrellas?\n\n&gt; A mendacious umbrella is a sign of great moral degradation. Hypocrisy naturally shelters itself below a silk; while the fast youth goes to visit his religious friends armed with the decent and reputable gingham. May it not be said of the bearers of these inappropriate umbrellas that they go about the streets \"with a lie in their right hand\"?\n- 1894\n\n&gt; Novels:\n\n&gt; The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind, whether they are furnished with salutary food, or with trash, chaff, or poison?\n- 1790\n\n&gt; And of course general decrying of decay:\n\n&gt; We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline; that the standards of culture are lower than they were fifty years ago; and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity.\n- 1948\n\n&gt; ...a fearful multitude of untutored savages... [boys] with dogs at their heels and other evidence of dissolute habits...[girls who] drive coal-carts, ride astride upon horses, drink, swear, fight, smoke, whistle, and care for nobody...the morals of children are tenfold worse than formerly.\n- 1843\n\n&gt; Whither are the manly vigor and athletic appearance of our forefathers flown? Can these be their legitimate heirs? Surely, no; a race of effeminate, self-admiring, emaciated fribbles can never have descended in a direct line from the heroes of Potiers and Agincourt...\n- 1771\n\n&gt; ... I find by sad Experience how the Towns and Streets are filled with lewd wicked Children, and many Children as they have played about the Streets have been heard to curse and swear and call one another Nick-names, and it would grieve ones Heart to hear what bawdy and filthy Communications proceeds from the Mouths of such...\n- 1695\n\n&gt; Youth were never more sawcie, yea never more savagely saucie . . . the ancient are scorned, the honourable are contemned, the magistrate is not dreaded.\n- 1624\n\n&gt; The children now love luxury. They have bad manners, contempt for authority; they show disrespect for elders and love chatter in place of exercise.\n~ 430 BC\n\nEvery previous generation has been wrong, but *this* time it's for real. \n\nEdit: And now I spent so long writing this the thread is already finished, I don't even get a participation trophy :(\n\nEdit 2: I found one of my favorite excerpts from a book. I strongly recommend reading the [section](https://books.google.ca/books?id=svVeAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=tea%20beer&amp;pg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q=tea%20beer&amp;f=false) on tea, it is one of the most hilarious things I have ever read. \n\n*Cottage Economy; containing information relative to the brewing of beer, making of bread, keeping of cows, pigs, bees, ewes, goats, poultry, etc* by William Cobbett - 1822\n\n&gt; \"I view the tea drinking as a destroyer of health, an enfeebler of the frame, an engenderer of effeminacy and laziness, a debaucher of youth, and a maker of misery for old age.\"\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI'm not going to argue for the virtue of participation trophies but for why it really doesn't matter.  Firstly, the trophy is literally a piece of plastic.  It's not like there are no winners or losers because if said competition offers anything of value, it would only be awarded to the winners.  Secondly (at least in my experience) even though everyone gets a trophy, only certain trophies will say \"Champion\" or \"Third Place.\"  So the winners do get something differently.  Finally for those who try very hard in sports victory would be it's own reword.  Kids who really care about winning would do anything to win and the fact that the people they beat get some cheap plastic doesn't kill their drive.  It might coddle the losers in sports but, in my honest opinion, sports don't reflect other parts of society and the naturally talented athletes won't lose their motivation.  I'd also like to point out that the idea of 1st-3rd is just defined by our culture.  I mean what is second place besides a glorified participation trophy.  Sure they came close, but isn't 4th place pretty close too (depending on the size of the tournament)? \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe prediction is based on the following key factors:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more conciliatory and rational tone. It does not confront the original post head-on but instead provides a pragmatic perspective on participation trophies, emphasizing that they are merely \"pieces of plastic\" and do not diminish the meaning of winning. This softer tone likely fosters openness to change without alienating the original poster.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response employs logic and personal relevance, using experience to explain why participation trophies don't harm motivation. By illustrating that the trophies are less significant than the desire to win, it reframes the discussion away from emotional reactions to practical outcomes. This contrasts with the first response, which is more combative and uses historical examples to suggest that moral panic over participation trophies is unwarranted.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response is clearer and more straightforward in its argument. It is concise, broken into well-structured points that make it easier for the original poster to follow. In contrast, the first response is dense with information and references that may overwhelm or confuse, thus risking disengagement from the original poster.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response acknowledges the validity of the original poster's concerns while providing alternative viewpoints, effectively engaging in a dialogue rather than simply dismissing the original post. This approach is more likely to lead to a change in perspective, as the tone fosters conversation and reflection, rather than defensiveness.\n\nThese factors suggest that the second response was more successful in potentially changing the original poster's view on participation trophies.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 448, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Graduation for infant and primary schools are ridiculous, and cheapen the meaning of a graduation.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThere is an increasing trend in the UK of 'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education).\n\nI appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a 'graduation' stands for. **There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions**\n\nTo give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same.\n\nMy son is supposed to have a 'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place. We can't even find out where this tradition started, or why.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

{"index": 449, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:Racism, sexism and general discrimination will only begin to fade when we stop pointing fingers and accept that \"Us\" vs \"Them\" isn't real, there is only \"Us\" on this earth.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIt's a fairly accepted fact that humans are social creatures and like to form groups. This can have positive effects like a sense of belonging, cooperation and division of burdens. However, to make a group, each member has to have something in common, other than just being human. It could be gender, race, a common vision or belief. You get the idea.\n\nSo by uniting based on common characteristics, we automatically exclude those who don't fit the mould. Thus creating every kind of discrimination you can think of.\n\nThe worst part is, if you look at groups of people looking to reduce discrimination, they're as much as part of the problem as the original perpetrators. One example of this in action is the reporter who was kicked out of a Black Lives event in CSU. African Americans have a long history of mistreatment in the US and many have the right to be furious. But the problem is that they see all \"whites\" as being the perpetrators of this mistreatment and exacerbate the \"white vs black\" dichotomy. \n\nMy opinion on how to solve these issues is this: I've been told that to solve problems as a couple, you mustn't make it \"you\" vs \"partner\", you have to make it \"both of you as a couple\" vs \"the problem\". So I think we should apply the same logic to racism and sexism. Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting. There is no Us vs Them, only Us.\n\nPerhaps you've suffered discrimination first hand (as I have) and disagree with my opinion because you want justice above all. In which case, please explain your opinion.\n\nEdit: Sorry if I reply late, having a bit of a family emergency. \n\nFirst Response: \n&gt; Women vs men and whites vs blacks (only two of the uncountable amount of dichotomies that exist) can't be solved by separating and pointing fingers at the other group, it can only be solved by uniting.\n\nThis sounds great on the surface, but fails horribly in practice. Most racism and sexism happens subconsciously. A white man is going to want to hire other white men. It's not that he's racist; it's just that we like people that are like us. Unless you point out this behavior and make him conscious of it, it will continue on forever.\n\nLikewise, a police department may arrest black people at a higher proportion than white people. It's not that they are racist, but the arrest records show that black people are more likely to be criminals; a connection is made in your mind. Making it a visible topic, you get the chance to consider whether black people really *are* more likely to be criminals, or if it is a self-perpetuating bias.\n\nSecond Response: \nI think you're overlooking the fact that most of the progress that we've made so far (racism, sexism, etc.) has been because members of both groups have united against the problem. For example, when women finally achieved the right to vote it wasn't simply because all women wanted to vote, while all men didn't want this; members of both groups united and tackled the problem.\n\nBut there's always blowback because not everyone wants to join, not everyone is as progressive as you think they are. Your view is (slightly) naive because it doesn't take into account that there are those people who accept (an out of balance) status quo and are willing to defend it. A simple example on Reddit is TRP. Feminists welcome men and women to work for the equality of women, but this doesn't go down too well with everyone so there are counter-movements. TRP is an example of a lot of stupid people who aren't comfortable with change because they don't understand it or because they feel that it's going too far.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response takes a more balanced and constructive tone, recognizing both the original poster's perspective and the historical context of progress in social movements. It emphasizes unity as a common goal but acknowledges the complexities of human behavior and resistance to change. This approach is likely to resonate more with the original poster, suggesting a deeper understanding of the issue.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response uses examples from history that illustrate how unity across groups has led to significant societal change (e.g., women's suffrage). By providing such illustrative examples, it makes a stronger case for its argument, thereby engaging the original poster on a level of historical precedent that might shift their view.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response actively engages with the original poster's argument by acknowledging the validity of their perspective while also critiquing it. It presents a counterpoint that highlights the nuances involved in tackling discrimination, which could prompt the original poster to reconsider their position. In contrast, the first response is more accusatory and dismissive, which may alienate rather than persuade.\n\nOverall, the second response's combination of respectful engagement, historical context, and acknowledgment of the complexity of the issue is more likely to shift the original poster\u2019s view.", "is_correct": true}

The author emphasizes their experience with long posts leading to rewarding discussions and deltas. This invites a sense of relatability and validation to the original poster's experience, as it subtly acknowledges the effectiveness of long discourse.\n- **Second Response:** The tone is somewhat more analytical and assertive.

{"index": 451, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Instead of focusing on making self driving &amp; eco friendly cars, we should focus on improving and expanding public transportation.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIt is my belief that self driving cars and cars that pollute lesser than their gas powered counterparts are an unnecessary diversion in creating a safe cleaner people transportation system. We already have it! It\u2019s the trains! If public transport such as railways are expanded and given priority over road vehicles in infrastructure, then we can achieve the goals that the automotive industry is trying to achieve very quickly.\n\nWe should divert the resources that we spend on making smarter cars (finances and human capital) to making smarter, faster, safer, public transport and expand the rail network. If we just expand the rail network then people will automatically shift from driving a car to riding on a train as their preferred choice of daily commute.\n\nSome of the points I have against road transport for individuals.\n\n\n\u2022\tEnvironmental impact- A vast majority of cars are running on fuels that emit pollutants in the environment.\n\n\n\u2022\tSafety- Road injury was one of the top 10 causes of death in the world. According to WHO, road injury took lives of 1.3 Million people in the last decade.\n\n\n\u2022\tStress\u2013 While driving for enjoyment is really fun on your off days, daily commute hardly is. We are spending a nice chunk of our day that we can spend relaxing, reading or working to complete the last minute project on a rather stressful, and repetitive driving route facing traffic jams and asshole drivers.\n\n\n\u2022\tEnergy efficiency \u2013 A car owner takes a Ton of metal with him just to get from point A to B. Fuel efficiency of trains is superior to that of cars.\n\n\n\u2022\tMaintenance \u2013 a car requires frequent upkeep and maintenance of its parts and components.\n\n\n\u2022\tEconomy \u2013 Transportation is lot more expensive in cars.\nHere are some points that I have for expansion of public transport.\n\n\n\u2022\tBonus free time \u2013 When I\u2019m in a train I can browse my phone, read a news paper work on my presentation without the fear of killing someone. This is something driverless cars are trying to achieve and are still years away from it.\n\n\n\u2022\tPotty Breaks \u2013 trains can be modified to have them, cars don\u2019t. I\u2019d have to pause my driving, find a gas station and then resume it again, why do that when you can go on the go.\n\n\n\u2022\tFuel Efficiency.\n\n\n\u2022\tNoise reduction.\n\n\n\u2022\tSkill Transfer- People who graduate in engineering and were thinking of joining an automotive manufacturer can just as easily join a locomotive manufacturer.\n\n\nI am not arguing for an absolute ban on using cars, I just think if we focus on public transport more than we would solve a lot of problems that automotive market is trying to eliminate. Problems such as energy efficiency, pollution, and vehicle automation can be achieved with technology that we have **today.** \n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

I will also try to avoid cultural biases.\nI agree with your sentiment, However I don't view the two as alternatives to one another, nor is either one a complete solution to all transportation problems.\nmost major US cities would benefit from better and cleaner public transportation. This is held back in large part by the fact that the US is heavily invested in the massive personal transport infrastructure it already has, and attempts to reform the entire system could be very disruptive to public life.\nThere are also inherent limitations to public transportation. Traditional mass transit is not a good model for the widely-spaced, diffuse populations in a lot of the middle of the country. It is also an imperfect solution for people with disabilities: a member of my family is unable to drive due to visual impairment, and cannot walk very well due to partial paralysis in the leg. Even if suburban public transit provided a direct route from our town to where she works, it would be very difficult for her to make It to and from the station. A self driving vehicle could allow for a greater degree of mobility and autonomy for handicapped people.\n\nSecond Response: \nOne major point that I think you need to consider is personal preference.  Like it or not, most people prefer the freedom to leave when exactly when they want, directly from their current location, and directly to their destination.  These are things that public transportation requires compromises on, often quite significant compromises in the type of environment that most Americans live in.\n\nWith that in mind, even if you were somehow able to fund and construct the *perfect* public transportation system, I don't think you'd get anywhere near 100% adoption by the public.\n\nI live in a fairly public transportation \"friendly\" city, by most standards, and while our system is far from perfect, it is fairly extensive.  I find it personally more pleasant to take the bus when going downtown, rather than dealing with traffic.\n\nBy the way, while we have a relatively good public transit system, we have a really poor infrastructure for driving.  Everyone here complains about the traffic, and it's only continuing to get worse.  I only point this out to say that my city is probably close to a best case scenario for giving people incentive to use public transit.\n\nHowever, most people here don't make that same calculation.  Either the slight time loss waiting for the bus on both legs of a journey, or the time lost stopping to pick up passengers, or the inconvenience of buying tickets, or the loss of freedom, or something else causes most people around here to continue to drive.\n\nIf a relatively good public transit system loses out in peoples minds to a relatively poor private vehicle system, then I don't think our time is best spent making a good public transit system marginally better.\n\nThere's a parallel argument that might make this point better.  A lot of people choose to drive large trucks or SUVs either because they use the hauling capacity for work or leisure, or honestly, sometimes just because they want to.  Some environmental activists would prefer we oppose trucks at all costs, pushing everyone towards smaller and more efficient vehicles, even hybrids if we can.\n\nThe problem with that is that we've had limited success so far.  Trucks are still a hugely disproportionate part of the total auto sales in the US.\n\nWith that in mind, is it still worth the effort and trouble to continue to fight against human nature and the incentives that push people into buying trucks, or is it better to limit the impact of the trucks that are going to be sold anyway?\n\nWe've finally started to do the latter, with new trucks starting to come out with much more fuel efficient engines, lighter construction, and better aerodynamics.  It's to the point that some full size trucks are talking about getting 30 mpg in the near future, which is better than my small hatchback.\n\nI see your argument as something similar.  In ideal world, no one would buy a truck unless they actually truly *needed* it.  In an ideal world, everyone would take advantage of a perfect public transit system should we provide one.\n\nIn the real world, people just want what they want for a variety of complicated reasons.  Ignoring that leads to solutions for ideal world problems which totally fail to do anything for real world problems.\n\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To evaluate the effectiveness of the responses to the original post, let's analyze their stylistic elements, including tone, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure, readability, and engagement with the original poster.\n\n### First Response:\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is somewhat neutral, but it also acknowledges the original poster's perspective, indicating agreement on certain points. It presents a critical view but does so cautiously.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** The response employs a balanced approach, using personal anecdotes, particularly about the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities.

{"index": 452, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV:As a society, we should not use public resources to cure or treat children with chronic illnesses.\n\nOriginal Post: \n* As a society we have limited resources. We have to decide how to best use those resources. Spending thousands of dollars on a child that is unlikely to recover is a net loss. I understand that an argument can be made to the effect that these children grow up to be geniuses, and great innovators. However this argument falls apart when we look at expected returns from spending. It is extremely unlikely that our sick child is the next Einstein or Trump. They also are just unlikely to be the next Unabomber or sociopath.  \n* Children that die of hereditary diseases usually will have not procreated before their death. Although genetic defects are not preventable, eliminating individuals which carry a higher risk of passing the trait to their child will improve the overall gene pool of our species. Look at the Black Plague. Northern Europeans are more resistant to infections now as their ancestors were able to survive the epidemic.\n* Ends unnecessary suffering. The child won't have to suffer anymore, as they are dead now. \n* I want to point out that public dollars should not be spent on treating the child. If they parents want to go broke trying to keep their precious child alive on the respirator, then go ahead and let them. Poor families can seek donations to cover the cost. Donators receive the \"warm glow\" associated with donating to a good cause. Healthcare expenditure increases, and with it GDP. Its better for the economy in the short run. Governments would have to reduce spending on other government projects, increase sources of tax revenue, or go in debt to cover the large healthcare costs if public dollars were used. \n* Letting the child die helps with population control. Malthus may have been wrong in the 1800's when he proclaimed the doom of humanity as he predicted the growth of humanity would outstrip our ability to grow agriculture. Because of climate change, and the overuse of farmlands we may reach that point in the near future. \n \nFurther information:\n\nExamples of diseases or ailments.\n\u2022Congenital Anomalies\n\u2022Malignant Neoplasms\n\u2022Heart Disease\n\u2022Cancers which meet the definition below.\n\u2022Live disease\n\nDiseases associated with high mortality rates and high treatment costs\n\n\n\n\nThanks for the comments.

It fails to take into account a number of things. Firstly, there is another definition of 'utility' - the maximisation of pleasure. Letting sick children die is an exercise in cold pragmatism, and not an action (or consequence of deliberate inaction, more specifically) that anyone would relish or enjoy. There is undeniable value in allowing and encouraging a society to feel good about itself, and failure to take that into account would result in a society that has less esteem in itself, and therefore a society that functions less efficiently, and is more likely to descend into dysfunction. Indeed, Jeremy Bentham, considered the founder of modern utilitarianism, said that, \"it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong\". And while your suggestions would probably provide a small economic boost, this does not make up for the inevitable loss of happiness that such actions would cause.\n\nTo look outside of utilitarian philosophy, I would also hold that your suggestion runs contrary to the entire point of government, which is look after its citizens, to safeguard their lives and livelihoods. A government should - and most, thankfully, do, to at least some extent - look after the needs of its most vulnerable citizens, *regardless of whether or not this is of any economic benefit*. Taking a ruthlessly pragmatic approach to the lives and well-being of the citizens in their care is not the mark of a functional government trying to foster a stable society, but of a government trying to trim society down to its bare, self-sustainable bones - in other words, not a government trying to its best for the people, but a government trying to make itself obsolete in one of the most brutal ways possible. \n\nAs for your Malthusian argument, I think the number of sick children being kept alive in the ways you describe is low enough to have a negligible effect on the total human population. \n\nSecond Response: \nYour entire argument sees human life from an instrumental perspective.  If life were just dollars and cents followed by investments for more dollars and cents then your argument would be pretty ironclad.  \n\nBut what if government's role is *not* to mimic business?  Instead government intends to create sustainable societies where all members have an opportunity for a life worth living.  The thing about that statement is that *all members* means **all members**.  \n\nIf life has not just an instrumental value, but an intrinsic value then it is our duty to protect it.  Inversely if life only has instrumental value, then we do not need to protect it in other senses either.  If it's cheaper to send 40x as many soldiers as it is to build better weapons then we just throw soldiers at the problem.  If it's cheaper to threaten the lives of workers than to demand that they wear protective gear then we just throw people into the machine.\n\nMost people would agree that life itself has a value.  You are attempting to draw the line at the types of lives which have value while disregarding the rest in some sort of culling. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that lead to this prediction are the tone and emotional approach of the First Response.

The response\u2019s sentence structure is varied, allowing for smooth readability while effectively conveying complex ideas, thus making the content more digestible for the original poster.\n\nIn contrast, while the Second Response also presents strong moral arguments, its tone comes across as more abrupt and critical, which may create defensiveness rather than encourage dialogue.

{"index": 455, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: America should dissolve in a Velvet Divorce\n\nOriginal Post: \nIn the early 90s Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved in the \"Velvet Divorce\" into two separate countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. I like that they split the name evenly as well.  They divided the national assets by population and want their respective ways.  While there have been some hiccups, by and large both countries are doing fine. \n\nI think America should undergo a Velvet Divorce of its own.  First the how, then the why. I'd like to focus on why it's a worse outcome than the current course of the country, rather than on the problems with execution (which are admittedly huge).\n\nThe How:\nEach political party designs a policy platform for their own country.  Everyone votes in a \"primary\" referendum for the various platforms, and the two platforms with the most votes advance to the general referendum. Based on the current U.S. political situation, Democratic and Republican platforms are likely to win top-two. (If we want to do more, we can, but it seems like 3rd parties would still benefit)\n\nIn the general referendum, every state holds a vote between the two platforms. The majority decides which country the state will join. \n\nThe likely countries we'll call the \"United States\" and \"America\". These are short-hand for the more liberal/Democratic country and the more conservative/Republican country, respectively. They're likely to look somewhat similar to the last few presidential elections, though with perhaps some defectors in either direction, depending on which country the states see as the real successor to the USA. \n\nFor five years, the government plans and executes the division of itself, the national assets, and national debts by population.  Anyone who wants to move from an area that will be in one country, to an area that will\nbe in the other, will receive government assistance to move.  (I would predict an exodus of African-Americans from \"America\")\n\nAt the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states. \n\nThe Why:\nIt's apparent to even casual observers of American politics that The USA is a nation divided, mired in gridlock. The result is a non-functional government in which no one is satisfied and major policy initiatives are tortured into Frankensteinian monstrosities to pass (Obamacare). \n\nAmericans have already begun to segregate themselves politically and we've seen a real deterioration of moderate politicians in both parties, who normally could help bridge the gap and find compromises.  \n\nThis stagnation is hurting the USA both at home and abroad. Significant domestic policy challenges are going unaddressed on the federal level (climate change, loss of the middle class, deterioration of transportation infrastructure, tax reform, cost of higher education) and as a result, the USA is losing ground against other countries economically. \n\nSo instead of constantly tripping over each other, screwing up each other's plans, etc, why not divorce?  The \"United States\" can try every left-wing wacko policy it wants, \"America\" can finally do all the nutbag conservative things it wants, and in thirty years, we see which country is the better for it?  Could it really be worse than the partisan gridlock that is dragging the USA down?\n\nProblems with this idea:\nThere are a lot, so I'll highlight some big ones on the procedure side and the effect side. \n\nMilitary:  Each nation would be nuclear-capable and have procedures and armaments the other side is familiar with. This means duplication of key assets (two NORADs, two Pentagons) and that new procedures will have to be developed to ensure neither has the advantage over the other. The \"United States\" might also suffer significance military brain drain to \"America\" due to the average political inclinations of service members. \n\nWorld Economy:  The world economy would go into recession as the world's biggest economy divides and both countries struggle with the inherent inefficiency of two economies where there was one.  Especially if either side enacts trade barriers to the other. \n\nRace to the bottom:  \"America\" would probably remove or reduce labor, environmental, and health and safety laws that are considered bad for business, making it more attractive for capital investment.  This would undermine the \"United States\"economy and progressive policies, as companies can get the same workers for cheaper. \n\nGeography:\n\"America\" would be continuous and vaguely similar to the Republican \"L\" of the south and midwest, with the \"United States\" split between the west coast and northeast.  This is not conducive to the survival of the \"United States\" as an intact entity, I'm not sure there's a nation that's been divided into two parts that has survived very long. \n\nFirst Response: \nThe problem is that we aren't divided on a nice and neat state level. Have you seen the [Purple America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_America) map? You can have liberal districts (often but not always containing cities) inside of states that strongly disagree with them, or conservative districts (often but not always more rural) inside states that are seen as liberal, and even beyond that things can be close (shades of purple instead of bright red and blue).\n\nSo for example Northwest Oregon would want to be part of the \"United States,\" but as soon as you get outside of the Multonomah/Clackamas region and Lane county the state would probably want to be \"America.\" This is pretty common throughout the country, with bastions of one side or the other even inside \"strongholds.\" What determines how the state goes isn't geographic, but based on how large the populations of the two parts happen to be. The same goes for a county.\n\nIf we are dividing at the state level they will end up in the wrong ones, and after some adjustment likely get back to the sort of gridlock we have. If you divide at the district level you will have a total mess, with enclaves surrounded by other countries and going back and forth between two countries ever county line!\n\nSo while the current situation might be far from ideal, break wouldn't even be as clean as many of the country breakups have been in the past along historic/ethnic lines that have a strong geographic element. And frankly, even then many of those weren't too clean to begin with.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;  At the end of the five years, the USA is dissolved, its citizenship, currency, flag retired and replaced by those of its successor states.\n\nYou've glossed over the absolute biggest deal breaker on the list.  US currency is not measured by a gold standard.  Our currency is based on speculation.  That speculation is almost entirely based on a name/reputation. If the country is dissolved, the currency is reevaluated again.  Upon reevaluation it is impossible for it to divide into even halves.  The different parts synergize to create a result greater than the sum of it's parts.  The division would result in a plummet in both economies.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are primarily rooted in the tone, engagement style, and rhetorical approach of the two responses. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response adopts a more analytical but empathetic tone, recognizing the complexity of American political divisions and illustrating it through examples that relate closely to the original post's argument. This approach invites the original poster to reconsider their perspective without dismissing their ideas outright. In contrast, the second response, while addressing a critical flaw, presents a more defeatist tone by focusing on the impracticality of currency division, which may not resonate as well with the original poster.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response effectively uses specific examples (such as the \"Purple America\" map) to visualize the complexity of political affiliations within states, which directly challenges the original poster's premise. This not only grounds the argument in real-world observations but also fosters a sense of dialogue. The second response, while logically sound, lacks this engaging rhetorical approach, offering a more abstract critique without connecting it back to the original ideas presented.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response is well-structured, easy to follow, and maintains clarity even when exploring complex topics, ultimately promoting understanding. Conversely, the second response gets bogged down in technical details regarding currency, which can alienate readers who might not fully grasp the financial implications being discussed.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response reads like a collaborative discussion, encouraging the original poster to reconsider the viability of their ideas through broad analysis rather than rejection. The second response appears more critical and focused solely on pointing out a flaw, which might lead the original poster to feel defensive rather than open to dialogue.\n\nThese factors suggest that the first response was more successful in changing the original poster\u2019s view.", "is_correct": false}

Your opinion is not an uncommon one, and I believe the developers have even stated that the sniper added the least to the game out of all the classes, but I think you need to articulate your reasoning better before I or anyone else can attempt to change your view. \n\nThe only point (from a gameplay perspective) I see you've provided is that the sniper is a long range pick class; and there already exists a far more dynamic pick class, the spy. However, the spy is an inconsistent, and thus ineffective, pick class. The range, preparation, patience, luck required to get a backstab on an attentive target (especially when players are actively searching and attempting to stop the spy from reaching a medic or heavy), combined with the fact that you are unlikely to survive after the pick in question is completed, again provided the team is competent enough to have a pyro near the combo to flush you out, makes the spy class hard to play and have little impact on the game. \n\nIf you've ever watched competitive Highlander, you'll notice the spy does very little for most of the game; usually their role is literally that of a spy, to sit with a Cloak and Dagger and report on the enemy's movements. In 6s, spy is the least used class besides engineer. It's because as a pick class, the spy is ineffective most of the time. If you're pub stomping or whatever, then you'll obviously dominate the other team, but a halfway organized team can shut down a decent spy. \n\nIt's necessary to have a class that can provide picks based on purely skill and not luck or the competency of your enemies. There needs to be a pick class that cannot be safeguarded against with little effort, at the cost of less role diversity. That is why the sniper is a very important class to have.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; I don't think that anything would be lost from TF2 if sniper was entirely removed.\n\nWell, an entire group of people would lose their main and would most likely stop playing. Also, all the cosmetics and weapons for sniper would become worthless, which will impact the economy and fuck a lot of people over. \n\nNow, I'm not a competitive TF2 player, but I can tell you that sniper adds a lot. Without sniper, people don't have to be nearly as careful with their movement. Also, Sniper has the ability to turn the game around by making important picks like demo or medic. Without him, the losing team has a small chance of recovering if they lose an important class. \n\nAs for pubs,  sniper fullfills the same role as he does in competitve, which makes him valuable. \n\n&gt; A good sniper has no real counter apart from another sniper, making them frustrating to play against\n\nA good sniper can be countered by good spies, good soldiers (depends on the map) and a good scout (depends on the map). Also, if the team is careful and has good movement, average snipers will have a hard time picking them off. \n\nThey're only frustrating to play against if your team sucks, which is true for the rest of the classes as well. \n\n&gt; As far as I can tell, snipers mainly exist to pick off slow moving or high value targets, which the spy already does and does in a more interesting (to play as and against) way.\n\nHe also denies the enemy certain paths, something the spy can't do. He also has different counters. \n\n&gt;  I also think the removal of sniper would do nothing but good for the class diversity on pubs\n\nYou can make the same case for scouts, spies and engineers when playing on defense. \n\nSniper is an annoying class. As someone who spends most of his time playing Heavy (inb4 n00b), Medic and other Combo classses, I hate sniper and Spy.

{"index": 457, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The solution to the human race's problems is to get rid of the human race.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWhile I would never expect or follow through with the destruction of the human race, I believe it to be the simplest way of dealing with our problems.\n\nI believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence. Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis. In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people. Tonsillitis would be the possibility of people doing bad things and removing the DNA would be what we do to get rid of humans. I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet.\n\nOf course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars. I am sure that within 50 years, a group could easily genetically engineer a strain of virus to get the job done. Mass production of asbestos and coordinated release all over the world could work too. What I'm saying is that it's pretty easy and could be done quickly. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nNow, this is all assuming a few things:\n\n- That if humanity continues, we will eventually cease to exist against our will.\n- That humanity will never have true equality.\n- That war will always continue in some form.\n- That we will continue polluting/degrading the Earth as long as we exist.\n\nIf each human somehow became the \"God\" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right. Of course, that is all BS/fiction and we live just like all the animals on the Earth, aside from being special in our own little ways. I don't think we as a whole can ever fully agree on anything, and that our disagreements will always cause us problems.\n\nOnce again, I believe the destruction of the entire human population to be our best solution.\n\nAs an aside, some other animal may eventually evolve to be intelligent in the manner we are, so the possibility of simply destroying all life to forever end suffering of any kind on this planet is considered.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

The reason we try to solve problems is so that we can continue to live without the problems. Everyone may have some hard days here and there, but suicide is rarely the right choice. Why not attempt to get rid of most of our problems so that we could potentially live better in the future? Just offing ourselves off has no benefit to us.

Humans have banded together against common enemies before. The Brits, Americans, French, and Ruskies all got together to fight the nazis in unity. Humans have strength in unity and ingenuity. I believe that when the circumstances are dire enough, we'll set aside our differences, temporarily, and work for a common goal of survival. We all benefit from a clean earth. No one disputes that. The question isn't \"can we fix it\". It's \"when will we fix it\". Humans have done remarkable things given our handicaps. We've sent men to the moon! Engineered probes to outlive their mission by nearly 20 years! Gone from obscure communes to globalized civilization in under a millennia with overzealous obstructionism!

{"index": 459, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: USA was unjustified in bombing Japan to hasten the end of World War 2. The government of USA should apologize from the nation of Japan.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWhy I hold this view:\n\n1.  America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\n2. Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda executed a brutal plan to orchestrate the 9/11 attacks. [According to them, their major motivation was to end the presence of US in gulf countries and other motives as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks#Motives) For this purpose they chose to ram airplanes in the WTC  &amp; Pentagon to achieve maximum civilian casualties and make a frightening spectacle for the US public. The ends justify the means seems to be their reasoning. Was Al-Qaeda &amp; Co justified in perpetrating 9/11? \nNo one would say yes.\n\n     If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths. \n\n\n3. Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.\n\n4. The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared. How do we even know the outcome of Operation Downfall? Moreover Japan was nearly close to surrendering anyway as the Secretary Of War, Henry Louis Stimson agreed: \n\n\u201cJapan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\u201d\n\n\nWe erased two cities and its people from history. We dehumanized them, reduced them to a statistic. W[e even censored images and stories of the Japanese victims to push the narrative in our direction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Depiction.2C_public_response_and_censorship). At least the Government should officially apologize to the nation of Japan.\n\n\nFirst Response: \nI think its important to remember when reviewing history, that we not use modern notions of morality and hindsight to judge the actions of those in the past without understanding the context those decisions were made, which includes the morals and norms of the day, and the physical evidence they had available.\n\nEvery time the atomic bombs are mentioned, it seems like people keep bringing up the same arguments about how the atomic bombs were unnecessary. About how these were intended to kill civilians and were unnecessary since Japan was going to surrender anyways.\n\nNone of these, however, take into account what the decision makers had to deal with at the time, nor do they take into account the facts about Japan's situation at the time.\n\nThe whole talk about how the bombs were unnecessary and that Japan was seeking to surrender forgets that Japan didn't surrender despite given multiple chances. On July 26th, the Allies in Europe already issued the Potsdam Declaration, demanding Japan's immediate and unconditional surrender - something the Allies wanted to ensure they could never have a repeat of Germany's rise after WWI which caused WWII. Two of the points here:\n\n&gt;Point 10: We do not intend that the Japanese shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners. The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established.\n&gt;\n&gt;Point 13: We call upon the government of Japan to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Japanese armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.\n\nNot only did the Japanese refuse this unconditional surrender, but Japan thought it could broker a peace with the US through the Soviet Union which was already preparing its invasion of Japan, to honor its agreement to declare war on Japan within 100 days of its victory over Germany.\n\nIn addition, the power struggle in Japan's government means that civilian government overtures to the Americans held little weight. The Japanese military government was the de facto power in Japan and often overruled the civilian government.\n\nFurthermore, the civilian government simply wasn't trusted by the US or any Allied nations. The Americans remembered that on the afternoon of December 7, Japanese diplomat Kurusu delivered Japan's reply closing with the statement that \"The immutable policy of Japan is to promote world peace.\" He didn't know, due to the lag in communications, that at that moment, the bombing of Pearl Harbor had already commenced. What diplomatic integrity did Japan have in the eyes of the nations they had attacked at that point?\n\nAerial and naval reconnaissance of the Japanese home islands showed that the Japanese were digging in and preparing for an invasion. These diplomatic overtures were often seen as just stall tactics in order to better fortify the Japanese home islands to make an invasion less appealing, and thus give better terms for a brokered peace, which was the last thing the Allies wanted. In fact, the Allies knew that Japan had tried that strategy before \u2013 the whole point of the attack on Pearl Harbor was to buy time for the Japanese to implement their defenses in the Pacific in the hopes that it would make an American counter-offensive unpalatable. \n\nSpeaking of an invasion, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, was planned to commence in less than 100 days. The pre-invasion aerial and naval bombardment was scheduled for late October, and Operation Olympic, the invasion of Kyushu was set for X-Day, November 1st. \n\nThe estimates for the death toll of an invasion of Japan were tremendous. This isn't some post-war revisionist estimates either - the military had estimated casualties based on the ever-rising death toll as the US got closer to the Japanese home islands. On Iwo Jima, for instance, only 216 of the 21,000 Japanese defenders surrendered. The US suffered over 6,700 killed and another 20,000 wounded in 35 days of fighting for *8 square miles* of island.\n\nOkinawa was even more horrendous - over 12,000 Americans were killed, another 55,000 wounded, and 38 ships lost in just 88 days of fighting. The Japanese suffered even more - over 77,000 killed with another 100,000+ civilians killed on those islands. That\u2019s estimated to be a third of the civilian population of Okinawa. Now extrapolate that Kyushu, with its much higher population and highly populated cities (urban combat is notoriously deadly - over 200,000 were killed in 16 days in the Battle of Berlin), and any estimate is going to start in the hundreds of thousands killed.\n\nThe alternative to an invasion, of course, was to blockade Japan and starve its people to death. This would take time - and would ultimately have killed even more Japanese than the bombings would have, as history\u2019s famines have shown time and again. Famine isn\u2019t just discriminate \u2013 it disproportionately targets the weak, elderly, and young who would die first. Likewise, with food rations given to soldiers as a priority, civilians would have been disproportionately affected even further.\n\nThus, the atomic bombs were to be part of the series of aerial bombardment raids designed to cripple Japan's ability to fight and hopefully force a surrender before the invasion was necessary. The US had already done firebombing, such as the raid over Tokyo which killed more people than the atomic bombs did, as part of this same strategic bombing campaign.\n\nThe atomic bombs were thus viewed as a new and more efficient way to carry out the campaign. Keep in mind that all the negative focus on nuclear weapons of today is borne entirely out of our experience with nuclear weapons from these bombings AND from the decades of the Cold War. The very concept of nuclear weapons being unfathomable to use in war didn\u2019t exist in 1945, and one could argue, largely came about precisely because these weapons were used.\n\nAnd for all the people that say the US wanted to kill indiscriminately, the fact is, the US dropped leaflets on over 30 cities in Japan in the weeks and months before the atomic bombings, warning Japanese civilians to evacuate their cities. They even very specifically mention that they are not targeting civilians, but the installations and workshops and factories of war.\n\nThe Japanese text on the reverse side of one of the leaflets dropped carried the following warning:\n\n&gt; \u201cRead this carefully as it may save your life or the life of a relative or friend. In the next few days, some or all of the cities named on the reverse side will be destroyed by American bombs. These cities contain military installations and workshops or factories which produce military goods. We are determined to destroy all of the tools of the military clique which they are using to prolong this useless war. \n&gt;\n&gt;But, unfortunately, bombs have no eyes. So, in accordance with America's humanitarian policies, the American Air Force, which does not wish to injure innocent people, now gives you warning to evacuate the cities named and save your lives. America is not fighting the Japanese people but is fighting the military clique which has enslaved the Japanese people. The peace which America will bring will free the people from the oppression of the military clique and mean the emergence of a new and better Japan. \n&gt;\n&gt;You can restore peace by demanding new and good leaders who will end the war. We cannot promise that only these cities will be among those attacked but some or all of them will be, so heed this warning and evacuate these cities immediately.\u201d\n\nChilling to read those words, even today.\n\nThe bombing of Hiroshima, however, was met with silence from the Japanese. As thus, the US proceeded again with the bombing of Nagasaki. Why a second one? \n\nSimply because that was part of the strategy laid out to get Japan to surrender - the US would use atomic bombs as they were manufactured and became available. Keep in mind that during this time, the US could not mass-produce atomic weapons like it ended up being capable of doing in the Cold War. The centrifuges simply weren't up to the quality and ability of years later, and so early on, they were only able to manufacture one or two bombs a month. Nagasaki was the second and last of the bombs available \u2013 the next one wouldn\u2019t be ready for use for more another week with planners estimating the US having only 7 total available by the time of X-Day.\n\nThus it wasn't about dropping a second bomb to be punitive \u2013 it was dropped because a second one was available. In other words, the plan was to eventually use the bombs continually until Japan surrendered or the invasion began in which case the bombs would then continue to fall in direct support of the troops until Japanese capitulation.\n\nAnd still, even with the Soviet entry into the war against Japan, there was silence and even resistance to surrender. An attempted coup against the Japanese emperor was tried but failed, and the Emperor made his famous broadcast to the Japanese people declaring his decision to surrender. In it, he very specifically mentions the atomic bombs, to which I conclude:\n\n&gt;Moreover, the enemy has begun to employ a new and most cruel bomb, the power of which to do damage is, indeed, incalculable, taking the toll of many innocent lives. Should We continue to fight, not only would it result in an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization.\n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; America can't ever be considered to be justified in using atomic bombs to end a war. Those bombs were dropped on cities full of innocent civilians, women and children. People with real lives, they were emotional sentient beings; not a statistical number. There had to be some other way than decimating two civilian cities just because we want to end a war quickly.\n\nThe other way of ending the war was a full scale land invasion, which would have resulted in many more casualties and destruction than what the final atomic bombings caused.\n\n[Japan was in no mood to surrender prior to this, or even after the first bombing.](http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-two/the-pacific-war-1941-to-1945/operation-downfall/)\n\n&gt; If we observe the reasoning of US generals behind the nuclear bombing to end World War 2, we can see some parallels. Al-Qaeda and American Generals both used a method of causing mass casualties to drive a point across. They both used lives of innocent civilians as a statistic to further their respective causes. The atomic bombings caused 246,000+ casualties (not taking into account the deaths caused later by radiation exposure and cancer. 9/11 caused 3000 deaths.\n\nYOu're completely ignoring the major military significance of those cities.\n\nHiroshima was a major army depot with many military headquarters, Nagasaki was a major industrial and port city home to many of the nation's war efforts, that had already been targeted before.\n\n&gt; Civilians VS Army: If you believe that the ends justify the means, then dropping the bomb may seem justified. But then you also agree that civilian casualties are fair game to drive a point across. Army is a different thing. A soldier agrees to the dangers of war and hardship for the protection of their nation. They agree to the fact that they may not return alive from a war. A civilian is a different case, their involvement in a war is very remote. To slaughter innocent civilians just because it will hasten the end of a war seems unjustified. Many people hold the viewpoint that the US bombing was in retaliation of Pearl Harbour. But the Japanese attacked a naval base, they did not bomb a hospital or a school did they? If we agree that the end justify the means then logically we have to say that Al-Qaeda was kind of justified to cause 9/11 as well.\n\nApples and oranges to compare Al-Qaeda, a rogue terrorist organization and total war between nations.\n\n[Everybody was attacking civilian targets in WW2.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing_during_World_War_II).  When nations go to war, that is what happens.\n\n&gt; The argument of USA that the bombing saved more lives compared to Operation Downfall, in the long term, is wrong. Because at least the lives of innocent civilians would have been spared.\n\nYou have no way of knowing that civilians would have been spared, they could just have easily have been conscripted to fight.\n\nThe Japanese had time and again shown that they *would not* surrender. [That they would candidly fight to the death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Iwo_Jima), in Saipan [civilians killed themselves to avoid capture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Saipan#Civilian_casualties)\n\n&gt; \u201cJapan had no allies; its navy was almost destroyed; its islands were under a naval blockade; and its cities were undergoing concentrated air attacks.\u201d\n\nAnd despite all that, they still refused to surrender. At some point, you have to acknowledge that the Japanese have culpability for some of this as well.\n\n[To single out the atomic bombings as some kind of extra-inhumane effort on behalf of the USA, is little odd, given that our conventional air raids did much more damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_raids_on_Japan)\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Both responses to the original post share similar content, but they diverge significantly in their tones, rhetorical techniques, and engagement levels. \n\n**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** The tone here is largely factual and somewhat formal, attempting to impart historical context and rationale behind the bombs' use.

It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes. I should believe this idea because evidence supports it, and not be afraid of the power dynamics it may disrupt. That is *intellectual integrity*.\n\n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;What matters most about an idea is whether it is true, not its political ramifications such as subversiveness, sexism, racism, anti-semitism, etc. \n\nI think I agree mostly, but the way humans tend to process generalized information, unless you're very precise with the idea you run the risk of, by holding a true and honest idea in your mind, carrying and perpetuating a false *impression* resulting from that idea. Let's take your proposed example for analysis:\n\n&gt;Here is an example of a true racist idea: ice age adaptations make caucasians less athletic than black people. It's mainly noticeable at the extremes: the best black athletes are better than the best white athletes.\n\nIt's *only* noticeable at the extremes. In the NFL, for example, 68% of players are black vs. 17% of the U.S. population. At the collegiate level black athletes are about 45% of the player population, and at the high school level the ratios are even less skewed.\n\nIn other sports, however, it's not really as clear or precise as you say. For example, Kenyans (specifically a particular tribe of Kenyans) dominate marathons, but you don't see them dominating in the NFL, do you? Or look in international football (soccer) competitions... the German world cup team (a bunch of whiteys) has done pretty well over the years, with tons of championships. Other national teams have also shown excellence, despite a lack of black athletes. The phrase \"less athletic\" is such a coarse generalization that it might give you the impression that white players cannot be competitive at the highest level, or that in the median competitive range (where most actual people would exist) that it's not close enough as to be ignorable. By perpetuating that unqualified general idea (even if in some sense correct) you're risking perpetuating a lot of related specific ideas that are false.\n\nAnd for ideas that are *false*, don't you think that a false idea that causes suffering is worse than a false idea that causes no suffering or at least causes less suffering? If so, then presenting a true general idea that carries with it associated false and harmful ideas, should be undertaken much more cautiously than a true general idea that has little associated downside, shouldn't it?\n\nSecond Response: \nSuppose an old man lies on his deathbed, and you are his estranged son. As he lies dying, he apologizes for the issue that has caused a rift between you, and asks for your forgiveness. No matter what he says, though, you can't really find it in your heart to give it to him. So do you lie and tell him you forgive him, or do you tell him the truth and make his final moments painful?\n\nConsider another situation. The prime minister of a nation is the best they have every seen. Under his leadership, the wealth gap between the rich and the poor has decreased; democracy has flourished from the ruins of the previous dictatorship; GDP has increased dramatically, and foreign investments are pouring in. You are his secretary, and one day you accidentally walk in on him having sex with another man, who you recognize as another member of the government he has close ties with. The people in your country are socially conservative, and the knowledge that he has sex with men and is cheating on his wife would ruin him. One day, a reporter comes up to and says that she has suspicions of just this. Do you answer her honestly?\n\nI think it's naive to say truth is the *only* thing that every matters about a statement. Honesty is a good policy because we cannot function without trust. But truth functions as a weapon just as much as misinformation. It is a true fact that black people have lower IQs than white people. Stating this fact without context (the fact that IQ correlates with environment and social class, the subsequent discussion about why African Americans tend to be in a lower social class due to the effects of American history and why this is almost certainly not genetic, the fact that IQ tests are biased in favor of the life experiences of the writers, the fact that a reverse Pygmalion effect exists racially, the fact that race as we use it is a social construct and that generalizations over race are basically meaningless the way most people use them, and so on) ends up having a sociopolitical effect anyway. Rather than explain why the fact does not imply what most people think it implies, I would rather not state the fact in the first place because facts don't exist in a vacuum. I wouldn't lie about it- but I wouldn't bring it up unless I knew my audience would understand it correctly.\n\nThe truth is important.

{"index": 461, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Graduation for infant and primary schools are ridiculous, and cheapen the meaning of a graduation.\n\nOriginal Post: \nThere is an increasing trend in the UK of 'graduation' ceremonies for children leaving infant schools and primary schools (ages 7 and 10). A graduation was originally to signify the conferring of a certificate and to celebrate that milestone, and as such should be restricted to University courses, and at a push to cover people at the end of High School (so that the people who go straight into work celebrate an end of their formal education).\n\nI appreciate that schools and the pupils want to celebrate the end of their time at that school, but placing children in garishly-coloured robes at the age of 7 only cheapens what a 'graduation' stands for. **There are other ways they can celebrate a new beginning without appropriating and trampling on existing ceremonies and traditions**\n\nTo give a comparison, consider how engineers in the US and Canada are given an iron ring in a ceremony to symbolise their obligation. The ring and the associated ceremony is a very personal symbol of their choices and achievements to the engineers. Now imagine how they would feel if every single infant school started copying their ceremony word for word, item for item, issuing iron rings to 7 year olds telling them it means the same.\n\nMy son is supposed to have a 'graduation' in a few months, and the vast majority of the parents are planning a boycott, organising their own event in its place.

The bad function is to congratulate students on their achievement. Because, as you argue, graduating from elementary school is not an achievement. It's expected.\n\nBut the good function is to impress upon students the importance of school. Their parents, friends and family show up. This says: we care about school, and you should too. It gives them an opportunity to express pride over the students' grades. And it generally shows children at an impressionable age that school is a central part of their life.\n\nSecond Response: \nI would argue that completing any stage of education warrants a celebration, but it does seem too outlandish to dress small children in graduation clothes. My only guess why this is happening is to show the kids that it's important to be in school and look how fancy you look when you do good! Also, some people may appreciate having pictures of their kids in grad robes at important points in their lives: aged 7, 14, then 18, then 22, whatever.

If you use the drug (nicotine), it can directly affect the health of those close to you. \n\nSmoking harms nearly every organ in the body, causing cancer and disease. Cigarettes are extremely addictive and many people can't quit even if they try.\n\nYet other drugs pose less threats and have a much lower or even a nonexistent fatality rate. They certainly aren't killing 1,300 people per day. \n\nCan you imagine if an illegal drug killed over 1,000 people everyday, users and nonusers? There would be political crusades.\n\nFor all illicit drugs combined, the number of resulting deaths were about 17,000 in 2013. For all drugs combined -- legal and illegal -- that number jumped to about 46,500 for that same year. That's an extra 29,500 deaths from legal drugs.\n\nCigarettes cause 10x more deaths per year than all the drugs in the US.\n\nWhy are we pouring so much time, resources and money into the Drug War to keep these *super dangerous* illegal drugs out of the hands of the American public such as marijuana (easy argument, 0 deaths) or even heroin (much more difficult argument, ~6,000 deaths in 2013) when cigarettes are so acceptable? \n\nCigarettes kill nearly half a million people per year and are the direct cause for serious health issues and reduced lifespan. They are highly addictive. If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs? \n\n- - -\n\n**Reasons I think we overlook this high fatality rate...**\n\n* culture and ingrained public perception of acceptance. \n\nCigarettes used to be advertised as good for you and everybody knows somebody who smokes. Smoking is not something you necessarily have to hide. Jobs don't (generally) screen for cigarette smokers.\n\n* in the eyes of the public, cigarettes aren't really \"drugs\" (i.e. they don't alter your state of consciousness; they don't get you high)\n\nAn 18 year old can legally buy as many packs of cigarettes as they want.  In the US, they can't even do that with alcohol (which gets you drunk). In states with legal marijuana, you also have to be 21 to buy/consume. \n\n* cigarettes don't cause immediate death. (shortsightedness)\n\nYou don't overdose on nicotine. Instead, cigarettes slowly kill you so there is no instant connection between cigarettes and death. For example, a heroin OD would be an instant \"drugs kill you.\" If you smoke a cigarette, you know you aren't risking your life right that second.\n\n- - -\n\n**What are some other reasons we overlook this fatality rate and continue to socially and legislatively accept cigarettes?** \n\n*Sources*\n\n[X](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/) [X](http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cms/Causes_of_Death#sthash.2ALBksdH.dpbs)      \n\nFirst Response: \nI don't disagree with your claim that the war on drugs is stupid (I choose to believe that's your claim, and I agree).  \n\nBut to answer your hypothesis about why we're mysteriously okay with cigarettes, it's because it's a lot easier to keep something away from people than it is to TAKE something away from people.  If the default stance on marijuana was already that it was legal, it'd still be legal everywhere and you wouldn't be seeing many people trying to get it banned.  Same as alcohol.  \n\nBut when something is *already* illegal, it's a lot easier to keep it that way.  If cigarettes were illegal already, they'd likely be staying that way, for exactly the reasons you mentioned.  People would be saying \"Why on earth should we legalize these things?  We haven't even legalized stuff that's far less dangerous!\"\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; If the objective of the War on Drugs is to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs, how can we rationalize this continuing support of cigarettes while stigmatizing the use of other, less harmful drugs?\n\nMaybe your premise is wrong about the objective of the War on Drugs. The War on Drugs came from the Nixon administration, with the *advertised* purpose ostensibly being to keep people safe and not addicted to drugs. But according to John Ehrlichman, who was counsel and Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs under Richard Nixon, the real purpose was different. Here is an excerpt from an interview with Dan Baum for the book \"Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure\":\n\n&gt;The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar Left, and black people. You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\n\nAccording to the book, the rationale for the war on drugs was to target people who were not likely to vote for Nixon: \n\n&gt;The young, the poor, and the black. Nixon couldn't make it illegal to be young, poor, or black, but he could crack down hard on the illegal drug identified with the counterculture.\n\nIf the book is right, acceptance of cigarettes falls in line exactly with the War on Drugs.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "Analyzing the two responses to the original post about the acceptance of cigarettes and the War on Drugs reveals noteworthy stylistic differences.\n\n**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n   - **First Response:** This response adopts a more conversational and somewhat informal tone.

Countries should have a 'no confidence' vote in elections if they want to increase turnout, while achieving a better understanding of the public's perception of the political climate.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIn New Zealand between the last two elections there was a significant increase in funding pushing for a better voting turnout. For many years now they have made it compulsory to register, however measures such as these seem to be highly ineffective globally at getting an increased turnout in elections, not just NZ. There was less than a 5% increase in voting in the last election despite it being a far more prominent election due to the kim dot com saga. National, our right wing party won so promisingly they were able to not form a coalition with other groups (this is almost unheard of in NZ). Many of my peers did not vote, nor did I as we believed that john key was a poor choice for a leader, but there was a lack of any leader that appealed to this group of 10 of us. We all agreed at the time that if there was a vote that had no significance in the election other than to measure those people who do not believe we have any valid current person running for prime minister we would not only have a higher turnout at the election with little effort, but we'd also have a better idea of what the general perception was on the stability of the political scene. This would help us to build a better political scene long term and involve the voter, ultimately resulting in higher voting turnout at a fraction of the cost or social effort and would result in a better turnout. This would theoretically apply globally too, as in countries such as the US it could be used to show many things, not just the (lack of) confidence in either leader, but also other things. I don't know any hurdles that would stop this from being non viable. Implementation might be a challenge but it could easily be overcome and the benefits would well outweigh the costs and implementation efforts\n\nFirst Response: \nWhat does a victory for the \"no confidence\" choice entail?  If none, I think it won't have much effect.\n\nThe US state of Nevada has had a choice called [\"none of these candidates\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/None_of_These_Candidates) since 1975, but it lacks any force, and even if it gets more votes than any other choice, the actual person who got the most votes is elected.\n\nIn the last Presidential election, [Nevada had slightly lower than average turnout.](http://www.electproject.org/2012g)\n\nSecond Response: \nWhat would the purpose of this vote be? I mean, you can't just elect nobody?\n\nWhen there is an election, somehow, a decision has to be made. And in a democracy, it is normally the people deciding which one from the list of candidates they want to choose. However, electing nobody is not a choice. Therefore I think adding a \"no confidence\" would only encourage the average voter to distance himself from every candidate and refuse his vote.\nIf someone is really unhappy about the way politics work, he should be able to participate himself as a politician. (I wrote should, because it is in many cases not very easy to do so)\nIf many people are unhappy with the voting system, maybe this could be revised in a way which encourages more voters to participate instead of refusing their vote.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to my prediction is the engagement level and rhetorical approach in the second response.

This approach leverages a mix of logical reasoning and ethical considerations, inviting discourse on the responsibility of citizens to participate rather than abstain.\n\nIn contrast, the first response provides factual information about an existing choice in Nevada and touches on its ineffectiveness, which is informative but less engaging.

{"index": 466, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Statistics should be a mandatory part of the high school curriculum, but NOT as a replacement for any standard mathematics courses.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIncreasingly, many argue that elementary statistics should be a mandatory subject in the high school curriculum.  I agree with this wholeheartedly, as the discipline has become central to civic and economic literacy in the 21st century.  But to argue, as some have, that this should *replace* the traditional \"algebra to calculus\" high school math sequence makes about as much sense to me as arguing that history should replace English.  While the two undoubtedly share some skills and mechanics, they are fundamentally different disciplines with fundamentally different roles in the curriculum, and both are necessary for a complete education.\n\n\nAlthough the underlying mechanics of statistics are undoubtedly mathematical, increasingly it is becoming recognized as a discipline in its own right, with its own methodology and best practices distinct from those of pure mathematics, and the structure of high school should reflect this divergence.  At the high school level, the focus of statistics pedagogy should be on core concepts, the appropriate use of technology, and interpretation-- you are teaching a student to turn data into an accurate, precise probablistic statement, and to have an intuitive understanding of the probability concepts underlying the meaning of that statement.  These are important skills, but they aren't really *mathematical* skills in the traditional sense; you are reasoning in a different mode.  \n\n\nIn a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.  None of these skills except arguably the last play any role in an elementary statistics curriculum.  \n\n\nYou can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy *does* reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear).  Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace.  Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.\n\n\nAs a final note, I should mention that I am here presupposing that both statistics and pure math can are taught *well.*  Obviously, a well-taught statistics class is much more useful than a poorly-taught math class, and vice-versa.  I'm well aware that bad mathematics teaching (and bad statistics teaching, for that matter) is rampant in the U.S., so I'd prefer to keep the horror stories along those lines out of this particular discussion and stay focused on the best-case possibilities of both subjects.\n\n\n**EDIT:** Thank you to those of you who have been willing to engage me on the substantive pedagogical questions.  I have re-thought my initial claim and now concede that there are alternatives to the traditional algebra sequence when it comes to teaching abstract reasoning and problem-solving skills.  I still stand by my argument that statistics fundamentally stands apart from math, and should probably be seen as a separate subject with some connections to math (akin to physics or computer science) rather than as an optional class within the math department.  But there are alternatives to the algebra-geometry-trig-calculus sequence that might better reinforce the connections between statistics and math while still accomplishing all the important educational goals.\n\n\n**To those of you more interested in debating the logistical nuts and bolts (concerns about burdensome mandates on schools, etc.):** thank you also for your participation in the conversation.  Some have made arguments that all state mandates on school curriculum are unnecessarily burdensome or will cost too much; I believe this premise has empirically denied, so these arguments are not convincing to me.  Others have made the point that, in the event that states are unwilling to add new credit hours to their diploma requirements, we risk adding statistics at the expense of electives or core courses.  This is a more compelling argument, but ultimately a risk I am willing to take, since I believe that in most if not all states there is room in the existing credit structure to responsibly add statistics in place of at least one course.  As a separate issue, I think increasing credit hour minimums and extended school days are serious proposals that should be given consideration as possibilities, though it is not my intent to make a full argument in favor of them here.  Unless you have something substantially different to offer than the above two arguments, I doubt I will be convinced by further discussion along these lines.\n\n\nThank you again to all who responded.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nI haven't really seen this point brought up here, so I may as well: you seem to be assuming the typical algebra/trig/precalc/calc track is representative of pure math. Many would disagree with that. Calculus and the classes leading up to it are a notoriously horrible representation of pure mathematics and, while I don't really have a great argument against putting statistics into standard high school educations (apart from the lack-of-resources argument others have mentioned), I can at least argue that, whether or not statistics is thrown in, calculus should probably be thrown out.\n\nI'm just going to preemptively say, though - Lockhart did a much better job articulating it than I can in his short paper [A Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf). I don't mean to pass the debating on to someone else, but if you've got time I'd really recommend reading it.\n\nThe main point is that calculus and the courses leading up to it are far too rooted in applications - they're treated as though they're going to be useful to students later in life, because in the minds of administrators, that's how putting them in the curriculum is justified. Because of that, teachers and students alike end up perpetuating the myth that math is, at its core, supposed to be useful and applicable. That's entirely the wrong idea, though. There is math that's useful, but applications aren't the reason we practice math, nor the reason we're interested in it. The real value of math is that it's beautiful, interesting, and most of all personally enriching. It helps develop important parts of our minds, from articulating ideas to critical thinking to problem solving. Calculus is the centerpiece of the high school math education not because it's beautiful or enriching but because it's perceived to be useful, and that's harmful to students (who, generally speaking, waste time learning it without ever using it) and to the general population (who, generally speaking, regard math as a tedious object to be wielded only for the purposes of science).\n\nSo, if the people creating high school curricula wanted to put in a \"math\" class that's actually useful, statistics would be a much better choice, I'm sure. I believe many more people would find themselves being able to apply it to their daily lives. I would hope the world doesn't forget what math actually is, though, and I would hope that, whether statistics is added or not, calculus is either replaced (by something that's actually done for its own value) or dropped entirely. \n\nSecond Response: \nThere was a [related thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/) about a month back. I think [what I said then](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3eqdj5/cmv_a_statistics_course_should_be_required_as/cthkp5o) applies here: if we have to chose, discrete math is more valuable than statistics.\n\nThis is mostly going to be an argument that discrete math should replace something in the calculus-track curriculum. However, many introductory discrete math courses spend a fair amount of time covering statistics, and I think that's very valuable for many of the same reasons you've covered. I think that discrete math courses typically paint a very coherent story up to statistics -- much more so than jumping straight into statistics. You talk about deductive reasoning, set theory, combinatorics, and probability before getting to statistics. I think learning and understanding all of those things helps frame statistics in a more intuitive way. For example, Bayes' Theorem (which is, in my experience, a topic in most introductory statistics courses) is much better understood with a firm understanding of deductive reasoning, set theory, and probability.\n\nYou say this about calculus-track curricula: \n\n&gt; In a well-taught algebra, geometry, or calculus class, by contrast, students learn to reason deductively rather than inductively, learn the theory underlying core mathematical notions such as function and equivalence, solve non-routine problems, and use mathematics of all types to analyze real-world phenomena.\n\nI fervently agree that learning to reason deductively is important. Wouldn't you say that a better way to learn deductive reasoning is to teach it directly? \n\n&gt; You can argue that a deep facility with \"abstract\" math has little importance in the \"real world,\" but increasingly the 21st century economy does reward individuals who have a high capacity for abstraction and problem-solving, even if you are never directly using specific skills (the classic \"when will I ever need the quadratic formula in real life\" bugbear). Finally, learning these mathematical concepts is a necessary prerequisite for any further study in STEM fields, which statistics training will not replace. Thus, BOTH statistics and math, as separate disciplines, should have a role in the high school curriculum.\n\nAgain -- totally agree abstract reasoning is important. I just don't think calculus or algebra are the best topics to teach this skill to the average student. Too often they devolve into rote application of formula or theorems that have no meaning to the student. Teaching deductive reasoning directly generally doesn't suffer from this problem, because the theorems that do exist are incredibly intuitive.\n\nIn closing, I'd propose that a better change to high school math curriculum would be:\n\n1. For the general population, teach discrete math instead of (pre-)calculus. Topics should include deductive reasoning, set theory, probability, and statistics.\n2. For more advanced students, offer followup courses in both statistics and calculus.  (I guess this is probably already the case at most good schools).\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to the prediction that the Second Response was more likely to change the Original Poster's (OP's) view lies in its constructive engagement, relational reasoning, and depth of argumentation.\n\n1. **Engagement with the Original Post**: The Second Response directly addresses and builds upon specific points made by the OP. By referencing their statements, the responder not only shows attentiveness but also positions their argument as an extension of the OP's logic. This technique creates a dialogue rather than a rebuttal, which can resonate more with the original poster and lead them to reconsider their stance.\n\n2. **Depth of Argumentation**: The Second Response introduces a well-structured alternative proposal that not only argues for the inclusion of discrete math but also connects topics in a coherent narrative (like deductive reasoning leading to a better understanding of statistics).

I've read more fiction than nonfiction so let me give some examples. \n\nIn the fiction category, I've read stephen king's \"the long walk\", \"needful things,\" and \"the shining\"; i've read pretty much all of crichton's books, and almost all of dan brown books. All are  quite popular books. \n\nFor comparison, the last 3 nonfictions I've read are [skunk works](http://www.amazon.com/Skunk-Works-Personal-Memoir-Lockheed/dp/0316743003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822539&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=skunk+works&amp;pebp=1433822538925&amp;perid=1EH2CEACB9PWNS9GT84H),\" \"[the code book](http://www.amazon.com/The-Code-Book-Science-Cryptography/dp/0385495323)\", and \"[Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433822683&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=north+korea&amp;pebp=1433822683392&amp;perid=11JG0BF3QCH819XQN6N9) \"\n\nSee, my view isn't that fiction is boring. However, in the limited span of time I have, I'd rather read 1000 pages worth of Introductory Chemistry, than 1000 pages worth of Needful Things; I'd have learned a lot more in The Code Book about cryptography than anything I would have learned from reading Jurassic Park (some basics about DNA and molecular engineering). \n\nBecause it's such a time sink, the amount of enjoyment from reading fiction is not worth the time it takes to read it. (1000 pages would take 1-2 days to read; I'd rather spend those 1-2 days watching movies or doing other time-sinking things that provides a much greater amount of pleasure). On the other hand, reading 1000 pages of nonfiction, while it would take even longer time, but it would let me get more out of it to be worth my time.\n\nCMV that reading fiction is somehow worth the time that it takes. \n\n**edit:** I've changed my view in the sense that not *all* fiction are created equal and I probably had been reading too much shitty fiction.

Movies make up for this in other ways, but they never serve as a true substitute for a good book.\n\nIf managing your time is a big concern, there are always audiobooks. Listen while you drive, do chores, etc. You certainly can't do those things (at least not well) while watching a movie.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe first response is more likely to have changed the original poster's view due to several key factors:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response has a more persuasive and reflective tone, challenging the original poster\u2019s viewpoint by making comparisons to other forms of entertainment. It creates an emotional connection by emphasizing cultural heritage and imagination, which likely resonates with the poster's broader consideration of value in reading.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response utilizes a structured argument that contrasts fiction and nonfiction effectively.

So I thought, why would a police officer even use firearms (I mean the guns that can kill, I'm not sure since it's not my native language) if he/she doesn't intend to kill? I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

There is a very narrow band, which is different for each individual person, that puts them under without taking away the possibility of waking up.\n\nOkay, so what, why can't we make a standard dose for a gun?\n\nThe theory of police having a gun is that they use it when someone is threatening someone else with lethal force. If someone has a gun on either the officer or a civilian, if someone has a knife and is rushing the officer or a civilian, the officer has the gun to respond with appropriate force.\n\nLet's look at what happens with a tranq gun in 3 scenarios.\n\nIn the very unlikely event that you have the exact right dosage: guy passes out. Probably not immediately, but maybe.\n\nDosage too high: you kill them. Not a huge difference from the gun.\n\nDosage too low: Uh oh, you still have a violent person charging you with a knife, and not enough time to draw a better weapon. You're probably going to get injured, and very well might die yourself.\n\nThe best worst-case scenario is the same as a gunshot wound. The worst worst-case scenario is cops getting killed left and right. The best case scenario doesn't have great odds, given the way dosages work with tranquilizers.\n\nIt's seriously just not a feasible weapon system, otherwise someone would be marketing it, selling it, and making a fortune.\n\nSecond Response: \nHave you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. \n\nI'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.\n\nAlso, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system. They could be allergic, or it could have an averse reaction with some other legal or illegal drug that they're taking. It could hurt them, cause permanent damage, or even kill them.\n\nI fully believe in finding a solution to police killings, but this just isn't it.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to my prediction are the tone and emotional appeal, as well as the engagement with the original poster. \n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more empathetic and reflective tone.

{"index": 469, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The way Reddit functions insures that you cannot fight against the popular opinion.\n\nOriginal Post: \nFirst time CMVer, but hear me out. Reddit's comment system creates hivemind tendencies. It does this in two steps:\n\na) Creates a system were downvotes are accepted\n\nAnd b) Forces redditors to deal with consequences if they are downvoted.\n\nThis creates a system, where, if you disagree with someone, you can downvote them. This also means that going against the hivemind will net you downvotes, resulting in people who spout popular opinions being the only ones who can do anything.\n\nEx: /r/movies does a thread about LOTR. You say you didn't enjoy it. You get downvotes and aren't allowed to speak in /r/movies until you wait ten minutes. \n\nFirst Response: \nThe flaw in your reasoning, here, is that you seem to assume that the purpose of Reddit is to create an open and equal platform for people to discuss different opinions and points of views. \n\nThis was ***not*** the function that Reddit was built with in mind. You are criticizing a sports car because it sucks on off-road terrain; yes, you technically not wrong in your criticism... but that criticism is still misguided.\n\nSo it will be near impossible to \"change your view\" and convince you that the points you raised are not true; instead, the view you need changed is your view of Reddit, itself.\n\nReddit was not built to be a platform for discussion and debate of differing views. It was built as a platform for users to come to and share and/or find the best content. Who decides what is the best content? The users do. And they decide by upvotes and downvotes.\n\nReally there would be nothing unique about Reddit of or wanted to build a platform that encouraged discussion of different--and often unpopular--points of view and treat then equally.\n\nThese platforms already exist, and they are called forums or message boards. There, you have no upvotes or downvotes; if you want to disagree with somebody, you have to do it in a reply. In this setting, all comments--and by extension, all opinions and views--are functionally treated equally. \n\nSo you really need to take another look at Reddit from a much different perspective than you are and understand what the system was built to do. It wasn't built as an alternative message board/forum platform. The discussions that take place here are actually a small subset Reddit's usage. I don't have the hard data to back this up, but I suspect the majority of Redditors only visit the site to find content that they **want to find** and **expect to like**; they don't come here to find opposing views or ideas that challenge their own beliefs. \n\nThis is not an objectively good or bad quality of Reddit, it is simply the nature of the beast. No, Reddit's system does not encourage opposing viewpoints or unpopular opinions to be presented on an equal playing field... but that wasn't what it was intended to do, anyways.\n\nWhen posting or commenting on Reddit, you do so knowing that you are submitting it for judgement by the masses. This is a risk you take. This may be seen as a potential negative, but it also has beneficial effects by discouraging useless contributions. \n\nIf you see the nature of Reddit being fundamentally flawed, then perhaps you should reflect to determine if Reddit is really the correct platform for the type of discussion/community you want.\n\nBut can you really fault Reddit for not doing a creating an environment it didn't **intend** to create? \n\nSecond Response: \nYou can challenge popular opinion to learn things you might not know since it led you to your question.\n\nDebating for a long enough time can come to a conclusion if you're not too defensive. Since you can't know the truth all by yourself, debating can serve other purposes than just have a winner, it can let all participants learn something they did not know.\n\nWhile it's true that you won't be able to \"fight\" all the redditor's opinion by yourself (and why would you even do that in the first place ? are you crazy?), posting and reading is actually a good way to take, give back and share in a fast and precise manner that the internet allows.\n\nThe only real problem is how strongly your opinions are and how much ready you are to listen to people you disagree with: you have to point them where you disagree, and let them show you why they disagree with you. It's a tedious process, and if you don't have any patience it won't lead you nowhere.\n\nAfter the 2008 crash I could say I was quite angry, but to be honest I learned a lot of things through reddit, it really allows you to challenge your ideas if you're ready to forget your views a little. It's way better than just reading wikipedia.\n\nSo, when you're being downvoted, also try to understand why by asking questions.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction is the tone and emotional approach present in the second response.

While it seeks to clarify Reddit's function, it may come off as dismissive, potentially alienating the original poster. \n\nThe second response effectively taps into the emotional aspect of learning and growing from disagreements, which can lead to a more open-minded perspective from the original poster.

It may seem like media's job is to produce stories, but the media's real job is to produce an audience for advertisements.  That is how the media gets paid.  \n  \nSo the media's real customer isn't you, it's corporations that buy air time for advertisements.  And this gives those corporations a huge amount of control, because if the corporation doesn't like what the media is doing, it will pull its ads, and the media company won't get paid for that content.  Thus the media companies pretty much have to do what the advertisers tell them.  \n  \nNow, whether or not the $36K per year reporter has an agenda doesn't even factor into all of this.  The corporations don't deal with the reporters, they deal with the people making multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars, who control the media company's editorial policy.  They are the ones who tell the editors and reporters what do do, and they are way more concerned about selling advertising time than protecting the careers of $36K per year reporters.  \n  \nOf course, the purpose of these advertisements is to get people to spend money on products and services.  So the corporations that make these advertisements want to make sure that the government does things that are favorable to them -- tax breaks, military procurement, protection from imports, food and drug approval -- to help them sell these products and services.  \n  \nSo now these corporations have to convince the government to do those things.  And they do this through campaign contributions and by ensuring that the politicians who support them get favorable coverage in the media.  This keeps the politicians happy and keeps them in office, and in return the politicians help out the corporations.  One hand washes the other.  \n  \nSo, in short, it's a cycle.

The responder acknowledges that there isn't a singular controlling body but presents evidence that some groups of journalists may collude, hinting at a deeper agenda. However, this response may come off as somewhat dismissive of the original poster's view of journalists being simply average people.\n- **Second Response:** This response adopts a more engaging and explanatory tone. It delves deeper into the financial mechanisms that drive media operations, and it articulates the relationship between advertisers, media companies, and the government. It invites the reader to consider the implications of this dynamic seriously, suggesting a more systemic approach to understanding media.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- **First Response:** It relies on a specific example (the JournoList scandal) to support its claims. This use of evidence serves to question the original poster's assertion in a focused manner but does not encourage further reflection beyond the case presented.\n- **Second Response:** This response employs a broader systemic analysis, illustrating how different entities (advertisers, media, politicians) are interlinked. It uses a step-by-step logical structure to walk the reader through these relationships, engaging them in a conversation about the complexities of media.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- **First Response:** The sentence structure is straightforward and generally easy to follow, but the focus on a single example can make it feel somewhat constrained in scope. The directness may limit its persuasive potential.\n- **Second Response:** The sentence structure is varied and employs transitions to maintain readability even as it covers complex ideas. It spans multiple paragraphs, allowing for a well-developed argument that is likely more digestible for the reader.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- **First Response:** The engagement feels somewhat limited; while it references the original poster\u2019s assertions, it does not directly challenge them in a constructive manner.\n- **Second Response:** This response actively engages with the original poster's concept of media as simply \"reporting on things that sell\" and builds upon it to create a richer discussion.

{"index": 472, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Whenever younger folks utter the phrase \"respect is earned, not given\" I can't help but understand it as a childish and short sighted attempt to undermine their elders.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWhile I understand the general principle that you're not necessarily owed respect because of your age, I find the idea of continuously \"earning\" the respect of less experienced and established people completely ludicrous. It should be the other way around, if only for practical reasons (the respect of older people tend to be far more valuable). Now, I'm in no way denying that younger folks have valid and interesting contribution to make. I think a fresh perspective coupled with energy and enthusiasm can be an exceptional driving force. Nor am I denying that older folks can be complete assholes because their certainly can. \n\nHowever, I could never bring myself to expect older, more experience and better established people to prove themselves to me. Neither can I see a reason to prove myself to younger people today. I expect respect the same way my father or professors did. Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers. \n\nSimply put, I find this phrase (\"respect is earned, not given\") is most often used pompously by younger people to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason. To my eye, this attitude is the product of four big misconceptions: \n\n1) **Older people demand respect because of their age and age by itself isn't worthy of respect.** I do agree that age by itself isn't a quality worthy of respect, but I don't think older folks demand respect in virtue of their age alone either. Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.\n\n2) **Showing respect and deference to others cost me something.** Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.\n\n3) **I know these people are whether or not they're deserving of my respect.** Assuming anything worthy of respect about someone is readily available is a common mistake. Relating to the second point, what's the price of respecting someone by default ? Worst case scenario, you change your mind later on. Best case scenario, you've done the right thing. \n\n4) **You need to prove yourself.** False. Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\". \n\nAs such, I think one would be better served by the idea that \"respect can be lost\" rather than \"respect should be earned\".

Why do people spend so much time and money to earn credentials which are supposed to equate to respect in their fields?\n\nThe answer to these points is that respect does cost me something. We don't have the luxury, with our limited time on this planet, to evaluate all corners of a decision. When someone whom I respect tells me something, I rank it higher in my decision making process. That creates an opportunity cost corresponding with any other decisions I might have made. If that more experienced person was wrong, I've suffered in some way.

Look at politicians or religious figures that charge large sums of money for speaking privileges etc. How I use my respect influences my limited resources including how I spend my time; it certainly isn't free.\n\n2) If you accept my first point that respect does cost me something, then we have to assume it's a somewhat fixed resource. **If experience == respect, then I'd have no choice how to spend that respect.** Take two politicians who have been in office the same amount of time. Chances are, you respect one more than the other; why? \n\nBecause one of them was likely right more or made decisions which you agreed with more. That means that not all experience is the same. There is some experience which is of higher quality than other experience. So let's say we work for the same company across teams and you've been around more than I have, you could say you've had more projects than I have, thus experience, but I've been right more. You've kept your business around, but it's limping more often than not. Is your experience as good as mine if I've been right a higher percentage? Should I defer to you? Heck, even if you were right as often as I was - I don't know your motives, the only ones I know are my own. The only experience I can truly count on is a shared personal experience, like working together over the years.\n\n3) **If you only had to prove yourself once, you'd only ever have one assignment in school.** You'd only have one project at work before being promoted. A general would only have to fight one battle in war. You'd only have to go on a single date before being married. \n\nThe reality is that you prove yourself over and over again, everyday. Athletes that were stars yesterday are duds tomorrow. Faithful spouses cheat. Bosses that pushed the boundaries of a business fail to adapt with the times. Respect make make it easier to prove yourself each time a challenge comes along, but you never stop. When you stop, you've already lost that respect. You've already proven you're not worthy.\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;Not veneration, mind you, but simple deference you'd ought to show to someone that lived twice the time you did. As such, they are not your peers.\n\nYes, that is what young people are objecting to: the idea that simple time on the planet demands deference (by which I assume you mean that the older person's view is considered valid and reasonable unless proved false).\n\n&gt;to undermine established individuals or to deny respect to their elders in spite of a good reason\n\nWell, let's distinguish groups for a moment.  Because as I see it, you're treating three groups as being the same thing.\n\n(1).  People who have established themselves in the area they're discussing (so a professor of public health talking about Obamacare)\n\n(2).  People who have established themselves in an unrelated area (a professor of physics talking about Obamacare)\n\n(3).  People who are older but do not otherwise have establishing credentials.\n\nYour argument seems to be that group (3) deserves deference because groups (1) and probably (2) deserve it.\n\n&gt;Experience, I believe, is what you ought to respect in even the humblest of persons. It's not a stretch to assume they've seen a lot more go by and might have a different perspective on life.\n\nBut that experience would need to be relevant and established.  Otherwise your argument is that simply being alive is experience, and thus that age by itself is worthy of respect.\n\nTo wit, a 23-year-old law school student knows more about the dormant commerce clause than a sixty-year-old steel mill foreman.  The latter's life experience is irrelevant to that discussion.\n\n&gt;2) Showing respect and deference to others cost me something. Respect is free. This stems from a lack of humility. It completely free to respect someone. The only thing holding people back is their ego. Of course you feel invincible at sixteen, but most people passed their teenage years tend to cringe a bit thinking back on their younger self. I know I did.\n\nExcept your argument isn't a neutral version of respect where we accept that everyone can have a different opinion and there's really nothing age has to do with that.  Your argument is for *deference*, which would mean the younger person submits on the issue to the older person.  That *does* cost something if the issue is either (a) the younger person believes he has a better way to do things, or (b) the younger person believes he is right and the older person is wrong.\n\nIf that weren't true, you wouldn't be posting a CMV, since your logic says that you \"deferring\" to me costs you nothing.\n\n&gt;Plenty of people \"proved themselves\" already and they shouldn't need to do it again. For instance, people get to positions of power and prestige for a reason. Getting a PhD isn't a walk in the park. Chances are they've been judged by better people than you already. I do understand their reluctance to jump through hoops again to \"earn respect\".\n\nAnd in cases where that's true, the person can say \"oh, and I also have my Ph.D in the subject we're discussing.\"  Again, you're treating people with credentials and people without credentials like they're the same group.\n\n&gt;Except the argument's merit can very be based on passed experience. Something older people generally have more of.\n\n1.  Past experience, not passed.\n\n2.  No, the merit of the argument is the merit of the argument.  And an argument based on \"I'm old and in my experience X is true\" is a meritless argument.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction include:\n\n1. **Tone and Engagement**: The second response directly engages with the original poster's reasoning through a more confrontational and analytical tone.

{"index": 473, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Talking about race, racism, and racial issues along with racial preference programs actually makes any existing problems worse, creates new problems, and divides people rather than unifying them. In my opinion \"not seeing color\" IS the attitude we should cultivate.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIn this post I am going to be very blunt. This is because I want to show exactly how all this impacted the thinking of myself and the people around me. I was born here in the US but I am of Chinese and Thai descent. As a child I grew up not really caring at all about race, I just sort of assumed humans came is all different colors and shapes and that was normal. I didn't even know there were names for the different races and ethnicities. The only thing I was really aware of was if people actually came from a different country.\n\nAs I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now. \n\nI grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't? And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.\n\nI learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets. All the commentary about how this was racist merely solidified my opinion. I saw how violent black neighborhoods are, I was catcalled constantly by black men in the streets, I worked in a leasing office and saw black tenants who lived entirely off the government and complained about everything. If I hadn't heard about race my entire life I would have written all these off as \"Man those specific people suck\" rather than lump the entire race together. People address these issues as if everyone else is to blame for these peoples actions, instead of saying hey, those are just bad people. Instead they make it a race thing where those bad people are actually VICTIMS. I heard about the police shootings and the publicity around them. I heard about the riots, and the more people talked about how the senseless destruction was justified the more I distanced myself and the more scared I became. I started to involuntarily see black people as a threat. My friends all secretly talked about how they wished all these people would go back to Africa so we could all live in peace. In the past couple years after all the discussion about race I have seen SOO many non-black people become essentially racist, and so many wonderful black people become entitled and vitriolic.\n\nSo basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past. If we keep bringing up race in EVERYTHING, kids start drawing lines and lumping people together as their race, rather than as Americans. They start noticing and being hyper-aware of differences between races. Crying racism in every situation just annoys people and defeats the goal of ending racism. Racial and diversity programs make people resentful, and make the benefitting parties feel entitled. People should be chosen on merit alone. \"Not seeing color\" is treated as ignorant and is laughed at, but I feel that this is the best way to operate if we are ever going to solve our problems.\n\nI'd like other opinions on this because the way I see the world right now truly sickens me. I don't want to keep feeling like I am different because I am Asian, I want to feel American and be okay with the way people talk about race. I want to feel okay with the way we as Americans are dealing with these issues. I also want to understand why \"not seeing color\" is ridiculed.\n\nFirst Response: \nMost people who have some privilege (whether that be class, race, gender ect.) grow up in a bubble to some degree or another. We think that the world is in basically good shape, and that since we don't have obvious problems like Jim Crow or men stoning their wives, social justice has basically prevailed to the most reasonable extent.\n\nIf you're a women, it doesn't take long for that bubble to be popped. You will probably feel that you're systematically treated differently from men, and in many cases, treated worse. If you're black, you'll probably feel that you're treated differently than other races, often times much worst. If you're poor, -and so on. In your case, it was obvious that that asians are treated differently than other people. It's a cruel perversion of reasoning when the stereotype that \"asians are smart\" is used to disenfranchise them.\n\nThese bubbles don't pop all at once though, what if your on the other end of one of the many inequalities society presents? What if you happen to be middle class, or white, or cis or male? A lot of times it's the same thing. We come out of childhood and realise that \"Oh shit, society is still kinda fucked. We should probably do something about this.\" And, that's uncomfortable, but kind of necessary.\n\nOur default reaction to questioning the way we live is usually, anger, annoyance, or disbelief. We don't want to think about fact that the lifestyle we've been living all our lives *might* be contributing to massive social harm. We're scared of being a bad person. Which is understandable. In the bubble, we believe we're a good normal person.\n\nYou can be a good person outside of the bubble. Even if you're going to involuntarily profit off of some parts of a broken system for the rest of your life, you can still define yourself by your actions and not the circumstances of your birth. But that takes some seriously uncomfortable internal debate. You have to seriously think about what is not okay in the world, and what you're going to do about it. It's a lot easier to say fuck you to who ever brought all this up and stay in your bubble.\n\nExample, few people like to think about whether eating meat is wrong. We just say, meat is NORMAL, why are we even TALKING ABOUT THIS? It's not like it's impossible to have a debate about whether eating animals is okay, and still come out of that thinking meat is fine to eat, or at least, that you're not necessarily a bad person for doing so. But we'd rather not even entertain the possibility.\n\nSo if we all stay in our bubbles and indeed school our children to do so, is institutionalized racism against asians ever really going to end? If we can't even debate whether or not things like racism exist in the world, how can we hope to be on the right side of it?\n\nIf this reasoning helped at all, it's mostly paraphrased from [Why Are You So Angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExEHuNrC8yU). The video is a lot more eloquent than I am.\n\nAs one last note on the topic of affirmative action, and reverse racism generally. It's possible for a black privilege and a white privilege to exist simultaneously. That doesn't somehow mean the scales are balanced. It just means the world is complicated and there's even more to consider now.\n\nSecond Response: \nWhile disappointing, I cannot say your view is unique here on reddit or anywhere else in the country, so I'm glad you're here on CMV.\n\n&gt; &gt; As I grew older, my classmates and I were bombarded with racial messages during school and everywhere else. We were taught that white people were somehow inherently racist. We were taught that everyone else was perfect and every bad thing they did throughout history was somehow righteous and justified. I started to see lines forming. White kids were told that they were somehow responsible for everything some people in the past did. Black kids were taught that they were owed something. I noticed kids start self-segregating. It wasn't anything dramatic, no one attributed this to the things we were being taught, but people knew they were different now.\n&gt; &gt; \n\nCould you provide examples of this? As someone who is black, I was never taught that I was \"owed\" anything. I was also never taught that all white people are responsible for the hideous injustices of the past.\n\n&gt; I grew older still. I started paying attention to the news and the internet,. Race was discussed alot. I learned about affirmative action and it made my blood boil. If you didn't know, Asians are hurt the most by affirmative action. I would need a MUCH higher SAT score and GPA than a black person to get into the schools of my choice. I started to resent black people for this. Why was I being hurt because an entire race was apparently performing poorly and my entire race wasn't?\n\nWhile I am not a supporter of AA, it is often a misunderstood policy.\n\nPretend you have 2 little league football coaches:\n\nCoach 1 takes over a team that was 2-12, and at the end of the season has a score of 8-6\n\nCoach 2 takes over a team that was 7-7, and at the end of the season that is 10-4\n\nI want to hire the most qualified coach. If I just look at what their current seasons were, I would have to go with Coach 2. Coach 2 clearly has a superior record to Coach 1. However, is Coach 2 really more qualified? \n\nCoach 1 obviously had to begin with a *much* worse team than Coach 2. If I honestly want the best coach, it would be foolish not to take that into account.\n\nThe idea behind AA is that we take into account peoples starting positions. This is where the confusion is. If an average white kid gets a score of 1980 on the SAT, and an average black kid gets a score of 1800, the argument isn't that the less qualified black person should get the spot. The argument is that the black student ***is*** the more qualified student. The idea is that we can't just look at the test scores in a vacuum, and that if the black student was raised in the same circumstance, they would have scored much higher.\n\nThe reason to not support AA isn't because it hurts the students getting passed over, but because it often hurts the students being let in. Even if we concede that a black kid being raised by a single mom working 2 jobs is at a supreme disadvantage, if we let that kid into an advanced school, it still doesn't change the fact that they don't have the skillset to be able to perform in that environment. Being a good student is learned behavior, and it is very unlikely this kid was taught how to be a good student. They simply won't be able to perform, no matter how smart they are, due to their upbringing.\n\n\n&gt; And if discrimination was the reason, well my race was discriminated against in the past too! This was opinion shared by my friends. It led us to think that if this was the case, black people didn't try very much and were lazy in school. Otherwise why would they need help? I was infuriated to learn that a black girl who took all level classes and wasn't even close to the top of the class was accepted into my first choice college while I was not, despite my excellent grades and test scores. When I went to college, I made sure to avoid going to black doctors and other black professionals for fear than they got their position due to unfair preferences.\n\nAsians certainly delt with discrimination in the US. However, the discrimination faced was far less severe and couldn't have as large an effect on their population. This is due to most Asian Americans voluntarily coming here, meaning you have a *very* significant selection factor going on. To put it bluntly, most asians already came here with marketable skills(otherwise they would never have made it here). When you have marketable skills, discrimination is far less effective a means to harm people. Here is a good video explaining this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Eu_bKJ11O0M?t=3m23s\n\n\nIf you no longer want to go to black professionals because of this, that's your business. But I feel the need to remind you that getting into the college doesn't net you a degree. You still need to pass the classes and graduate, and black students don't get AA while professors are grading their exams.\n\n&gt; I learned about the black crime rate, and prison population. I started to become scared when I saw a black person on the streets.\n\nYou need to be careful with how you interpret statistics. The reason that most people will charge people who cite these statistics racist is because they are usually trying to cite them to present a narrative of the black thug, and do very little to interpret any statistic honestly. Here is a related example.\n\nImagine you have a small asian town in California that kidnaps people that pass by and cannibalizes them. They do this for an entire year, kidnapping around 50 people.\n\nWhen they're caught, and then convicted of this heinous act, later that year I release a headline:\n\n**98% of all cannibalism cases committed by asians**.\n\nThis would be a true statement statistically. Since cannibalism is a very rare crime, this town would responsible for almost 100 percent of the cannibalism cases. However, this is disingenuous to say the least. Me presenting the headline in that manner suggests that asians everywhere are to be feared. Seeing an asian in Vermont might cause people to be cautious that that person would eat them. By printing it I would *knowingly* be spreading misinformation, while technically not telling a single lie.\n\nAs for the black crime rate, most of it is concentrated in very specific high crime areas. You could look at the murder rate the same way we looked at cannibalism. It is, when dealing with a country of 330 million, a rare crime. In 2013 there were about 14,000 murders total. If half of those were black males, that is *still* only 7000. If we are **generous** and say all those murders were committed by unique individuals, we still have 7000 males out of how many millions? This means that 99.9% of black people you  meet have never killed anyone, and will never kill anyone. Sure, you could say that for other races it is 99.99, or 99.999, but 0.01 is still an infinitesimal amount of people no matter how you slice it. To top it off the bulk of these murders can again be traced back to about a dozen or so places. Most of them dealing with drugs. The idea that black people are just running around killing everyone is a myth. To make it more personal, has any black person ever put their hands on you? Assaulted you? Murdered someone you know? My guess is no, and it will probably never happen.\n\nAnother common misconception seen on reddit is \"black people kill white people like 10 bajilliion times more than white people kill black people.\" Technically true, but misleading. Let's leave out the fact that gross population differences will screw with these numbers, as this post is long enough as is, and just stick with the same line of reasoning as before. In 2013, the amount of whites murdered by blacks was around 350. Not 350,000, not 3500....350. If you're white in this country the chances of a black person killing you is essentially zero percent. You're 10 times more likely to die of food poisoning, and how often are you worried about that?\n\n&gt; So basically, I feel like if we brought our kids up to not see color and talk about Americans as Americans, rather than african-american, asian american, etc, racism would soon become a thing of the past\n\nIt's odd that you say this, while admitting earlier that you're a racist. Racism cannot be solved by simply ignoring it. If you think it can, then indulge me with examples of *any* problem with society that was changed through people ignoring the problem. I'd be surprised if you could give me a singe example.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor that led to my prediction lies in the engagement strategy and method of reasoning used in the Second Response.

None.\n\nWorking together in an office is an impediment to getting work done, and is a source of constant interruption.\n\nEmail is generally better for productivity than face to face contact, or instant messaging.\n\nBoth face to face contact, and instant messaging, are distractions, and are useful primarily in the situation that you cannot progress on anything without immediate input.

To be an asset, one must be able to get work done on one's own, and coordinate as necessary.\n\nIn fact, I would go so far as to say that, if you're not going to physically touch the other person, there is nothing you can do in a face to face meeting that you cannot do online.\n\nThere's literally no reason to meet unless you're going to kiss, or have sex, or give a person a massage.\n\nFirst Response: \nThis is a bit of a weird example, but Naughty Dog and Insomniac Games used to work in the same Universal Studios backlot. They pretty much worked in the same cubicles. The games they created, like Crash Bandicoot and Spyro the Dragon, were better games because of the constant chatting between members of the two companies. Each of the two examined the other company's software and saw amazing new features they could add to themselves. It was a source of friendly competition, and everyone was involved. The softwares the two companies created proved to be some of the most top-selling and highly regarded Playstation titles at the time.

{"index": 475, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Elements created in a lab that cannot exist in nature or in quantities greater than a few atoms for microseconds at a time have no place on the periodic table\n\nOriginal Post: \nI'm no chemist, but I do study science as a hobby, and in reading up on elements such as [ununpentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununpentium) or [ununtrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ununtrium), I got the feeling that it's almost cheating to call these things elements and add them to the periodic table.\n\nThe atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.\n\nCalling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, \"Look! I've created a bookbottle!\"\n\nThe object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.\n\nUnunpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.\n\nChange my view.\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nWow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. \n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n&gt;Short half life\n\nIt's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.\n\n&gt;Very few atoms at a time\n\nThis is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.\n\n&gt;Not outside the lab.\n\nWhere it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.\n\nThere are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion.\n\nFirst Response: \nI see the periodic table as a way to show that the elements belong together. It shows there is order in the world that can be understood, and it's beautiful. \n\nOne of the most amazing features of the periodic table is that the guy who made it has left *holes* in the table. He said \"I don't know what it is, but there must be an element I have never seen before that goes here\". He has predicted the qualities of these elements before they were discovered. Even if the artificial superheavy elements are not useful in our every day life, if we left them out, there would be holes in the table, never to be filled.\n\nI don't think we should look at the elements in the table one by one. The atomic mass of oxygen alone is not very interesting. The important information is \"how different\" it is from the nearby elements. The table shows how the nature of matter changes as we keep adding protons.

{"index": 476, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: A minimum wage increase will hurt the poor and the economy, not help it.\n\nOriginal Post: \nOver the past year, the idea of raising the minimum wage in Canada (where I live) and in the USA has gained popularity. Many states and provinces are either mandating, or in the process of mandating a minimum wage of ~$15/hour. While on the surface, this seems like a good policy for strengthening the poor/middle class I believe this will ultimately HURT, not help the public, and especially the poor. \n\nHere are several common arguments made in favour of the raising minimum wage and my response:\n\n* \"Average wages haven't increased despite an increase in production and profit in the economy\"\n\nIt's a common misunderstanding that wages are/should be directly tied to production. In reality wages are determined just like prices of anything else, through supply and demand. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled and easily replaceable (through either humans or automation) making the supply of labour far larger than the demand, which equals a lower wage. The rise in technology that has resulted in higher production from labour has little affect on wages. \n\n* \"Current minimum wages are so low that they do not pay a livable annual salary, keeping the working poor in a perpetual state of poverty\"\n\nI would challenge the idea that most minimum wage jobs were ever meant to be sustainable for living. Most minimum wage jobs are unskilled labour (ex. factory work, assembly lines) or service industry jobs (cooks, janitorial staff, retail jobs etc..). At least to me, these seem like temporary work done by people in the process of finding higher paying employment (students, recent graduates, new immigrants etc...), and not intended as a career at all, so a livable wage is not required. \n\n* \"A higher minimum wage would increase the income of many in the population, boosting spending, saving and the overall economy.\"\n\nAs I said previously, the vast majority of minimum wage jobs are easily replaceable, outsourced or automated. If large companies are forced by government to pay high minimum wages, they will seek cheaper alternatives and replacements instead. For example, a McDonald's hamburger could very easily be made faster, cheaper, cleaner and better by a machine, [like this one, which makes a burger every 10 seconds ](http://www.businessinsider.com/momentum-machines-burger-robot-2014-8). If the minimum wage gets high enough that it costs McDonald's more to pay 10 people to flip burgers than one machine, they will simply replace the human labour altogether. This will result in an increase in unemployment. So while those who retain their minimum wage jobs will be better off, many will simply be replaced, leaving the unemployed workers in a WORSE position than before. \n\nHere are some things that would change my view: \n\n* Research evidence that demonstrates positive impact from countries/states that have already raised minimum wage\n\n* A justification that the minimum wage must be a \"living wage\"\n\n* Evidence that a wage increase would not result in the loss of unskilled jobs to outsourcing, automation etc...\n\n* Any other reasonable justification of minimum wage\n\n\nPlease change my view!\n\n\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

However, [an analysis of 64 studies](http://www.cepr.net/blogs/cepr-blog/studying-the-studies-on-the-minimum-wage) regarding minimum wage and teenage employment concluded that most studies, and the most precise studies, showed raising the minimum wage had little or no effect on employment levels. \n\nAlso, a different meta-analysis, from [here](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf) (PDF warning):\n\n&gt; Paul Wolfson and Dale Belman have carried out their own meta-analysis of the minimum wage,\nfocusing on studies published only since 2000. They identified 27 minimum wage studies...They then produced a range of meta-estimates, controlling for many features of the underlying studies, including the type of worker analyzed (teens or fast foodworkers), whether the study focused on the supply or the demand side of the labor market, who the authors of the study were, and other characteristics. **The resulting estimates varied, but revealed no statistically significant negative employment effects of the minimum wage.**\n\nSecond Response: \nhow about this (the conclusion of the study): [\"Economists have conducted hundreds of studies of the employment impact of the minimum wage. Summarizing those studies is a daunting task, but two recent meta-studies analyzing the research conducted since the early 1990s concludes that the minimum wage has little or no discernible effect on the employment prospects of low-wage workers. The most likely reason for this outcome is that the cost shock of the minimum wage is small relative to most firms' overall costs and only modest relative to the wages paid to low-wage workers. In the traditional discussion of the minimum wage, economists have focused on how these costs affect employment outcomes, but employers have many other channels of adjustment. Employers can reduce hours, non-wage benefits, or training. Employers can also shift the composition toward higher skilled workers, cut pay to more highly paid workers, take action to increase worker productivity (from reorganizing production to increasing training), increase prices to consumers, or simply accept a smaller profit margin. Workers may also respond to the higher wage by working harder on the job. But, probably the most important channel of adjustment is through reductions in labor turnover, which yield significant cost savings to employers.\"](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf)\n\nSo yeah, it doesn't cause job losses to increase the minimum wage a reasonable amount.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "1. **Comparison of the Responses:**\n\n   - **Tone and Emotional Approach:** \n     - **First Response:** The tone is more neutral and academic, emphasizing different studies without overtly emotional language.

You either get a partnership or you don't, and even if you do get the partnership, there's no saying that what you make will be enough to live off of, so it's probably just safer to get a real job.\n\nFor Youtube, it seems like you need to be the following to be successful:\n\n* A young attractive person (or at least a person with an attractive voice) that appeals to some major demographic (teenage girls, LGBT teens, sports fans, etc.)\n\n* Someone who was already famous on a different social medium\n\n* A Let's Player\n\nAnd in all of these, you need a certain budget to spend on making your videos (light, camera, a crew maybe?) and that's not including the money you need for specific videos (e.g. a Let's Player needs enough money to buy new/big budget games in order to attract attention, a make-up channel needs to buy TONS of products, clothing channels need to shop on a regular basis, etc.).\n\nTwitch has the same problems as a Youtube Let's Player; in order to be noticed, you need to buy really popular games and/or new games, and those are rarely cheap; most games are up in the $60+ range, not including DLC or even the equipment needed to stream at a constant frame-rate for long periods of time. \n\nEven if you DO get popular on either of these platforms and get a partnership, Twitch takes half of your subscription profits, leaving you mostly depending on possible donations, and Youtube takes a lot of your ad revenue (not including other Youtube-related partnerships you might have [cough cough Nintendo cough]). \n\nIf you ABSOLUTELY need to make money on one of these platforms, or a similar platform, then you should either be rich or have had a real job long enough that you have enough money to survive.\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nAs is said about the game development community sometimes, \"Passion is cheap in this industry.\"  No one's putting up a 'Help Needed: Play video games and ad lib for a living, starting salary $60k'.\n\nSo yeah - the competition is rough, I would imagine.  And while luck, like in any entertainment industry, is a factor, I think it's only a portion of it.  For one, you just have to *be entertaining*.  That's something you can learn to an extent, but a lot of it is just your personality.  You gotta be funny, you gotta be creative, you gotta be able to offer something that the million other people that would like to be able to do the same thing can't offer.\n\nThe other thing is you gotta be on your grind day after day.  Even if you have the goods you gotta out there and that takes time.  If you look at some twitch streamers that have big followings without seemingly having a big hook, that's largely because they were there early and they've been there night after night, hour after hour, for years, getting exposure.\n\nSecond Response: \nThis is very much like a career in acting. You could say: well only a lucky few get to perform in movies. But the truth is, luck often has very little to do with it.\n\n1: You most certainly do not need to be an attractive person to get an audience. Sure, it might help a bit, but there are plenty of examples which say otherwise. Take for example boogie2988. He is a big overweight person with 2.5 million subscribers. He is a lot of things, but I do not think his viewerbase thinks he is attractive on the appearance side of things.\n\n2: Neither is it important to be famous from other media. Sure it helps out greatly, but it is no more than a kickstart. The real reason for their career lies in something else, which I shal expend on in the final paragraphs. Take for example again boogie2988, or as a fresh example lindsey stirling. Lindsey Stirling is a musician, who became famous through youtube. She made some excellent music, and gained a fair share of subscribers. She became famous because someone entered her in the King of the web contest, and she went from a youtube musician to someone touring all over the world. Marketing and skill are key.\n\n3: While let's players have an easier time, because half of the content is made for them, there are plenty of other examples of people who became big without let's plays. In the top 100 youtube subscriber list, there are plenty of examples. Many music channel, or things like epic mealtime, prankvsprank or ERB (epic rap battles).\n\n\nSo let's start talking about what made them succesfull in the first place. There are 3 big things which in my opinion get you a career in youtube/streaming\n\n1: skill. The same reason why professional sports is one of the most watched media. The ability to do what millions of others cannot. The reason why so many league of legend channels are so big, is because the game has a large playerbase, and those players love watching the absolute top. It may not always be able to achieve this for everyone, but let me say that the top 50 Starcraft 2 players practise a lot.\n\n2: following up on that is the most important section: dedication. Starting a channel or stream takes a lot of time. The mistake many people make is that they stream for maximum 2 hours, finally have 3 viewers and stop streaming. People attract people, and even the bigger streamers don\u00b4t achieve their mx viewers until hours after starting.\n\nThis also goes for youtube. If you can only post 1 quality video every 2 weeks, you channel is not interesting enough. The ability to be a consistant source of entertainment is important. Lethalfrag is an example of someone who made it into streaming. He saved his money so he didnt need income for a year, and went all/out streaming. He started from nothing, but since he was entertaining and going the entire year, he achieved his goal, and could sustain himself. Boogie2988 has been youtubing for over 9 years now, he never gave up on the early hurdles.\n\n3: charismatic. Just like acting you need some skills. Give viewers a good reason to watch you over those other 200 channels. Although not my taste, a channel like pewdiepie knows what fanbase he has, and how to entertain them. stand out from others.\n\nso to conclude. Yes, making money (enough to sustain yourself) only happens to a few. But those are not the lucky few, those are the people with the dedication (mostly) and skill (secondary) to really go for it. It is a lot like acting. Sure getting a real job is safer, but your work is more than just income. I rather be barely surviving doing the thing i love, than being filthy rich and doing what i hate for 9 hours a day.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction include the deeper engagement with the original poster's argument and the comprehensive structure of the second response.

But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. \n\nAn adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right.\n\nYou might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years.

{"index": 479, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: So-called \"fat taxes\" should not be on junk food, they should be on pants.\n\nOriginal Post: \nAs more and more people in the developed world are becoming obese, many governments have begun to tax various foods they deem unhealthy because they are allegedly contributing to this epidemic.  While pigovian (no pun intended) taxes of this kind may have been effective for things like alcohol or tobacco, I believe they only work when the tax makes up the majority of the price of the product.  An extra ten cents on his morning can of gravy isn't going to make fatso switch to Slimfast.  \n\nUnfortunately doubling or tripling the price of junk food would completely destroy the market for these things and put manufacturers out of business almost immediately.  This is because there are easy untaxed alternatives to junk food, unlike booze and cigarettes.  Granted you could grow your own tobacco and brew your own beer, but that takes months, while making junk food from tax-free ingredients takes minutes.  Plus if a steak cost the same as a bag of chips people would simply become obese on sirloin rather than Doritos.  \nRaising the price of food like this would also be harmful to the poor, especially considering junk food often provides the most calories for your dollar, and is thus essential for many poor people to meet their daily nutritional requirements.  Say what you want about a diet high in fat and sugar, it's still healthier than starvation.\n\nIn addition it's grossly unfair to punish everybody when it's only the obese that need to cut back.  Even alcohol and tobacco would be relatively harmless in moderation, but in practice it would be too difficult for a vendor to tell if someone is an alcoholic chain-smoker or if they have self-control.  On the other hand, much to their chagrin, nobody has ever mistaken an obese person for slim, no matter how strong the elastic in their girdle.\n\nUnfortunately if such a system were implemented many fatties would cheat it by having skinny friends or relatives buy their junk food for them.  The only viable solution as I see it would be not to tax food, but rather pants, say by $5-10 per inch the waistline is larger than the inseam.

Any questions or concerns? Feel free to* ***[message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/changemyview)***. *Happy CMVing!*\n\nFirst Response: \nAre they actually effective?\n\nThe pledge of allegiance, in particular, seems utterly counterproductive. Children start reciting it before they can have any idea what these fancy, archaic words mean -- maybe \"liberty and justice for all\" might have some meaning, but \"indivisible\"? Or \"republic\"? And even \"liberty and justice for all\" is going to sound more than a little abstract to a kid who will rarely feel the liberty to refuse reciting this ritual.\n\nBut even that is assuming too much. It's said so often that it loses all meaning, to the point where it's so *boring* to these kids that they start inventing [alternate pledges](http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/2009/10/22) just to pass the time.\n\nI think it's similar to religion in Europe. Unlike the US, many European countries have no legal notion of separation of church and state -- several have actual, official state religions, like the Church of England. And those countries all have far less religiosity than the US, with nonbelief (or at least apathy) rising as high as 50%.\n\nWhich should come as no surprise. When the Church could torture or kill you for heresy, they could actually force people to fall into line. But the status of the Church of England has become largely ceremonial. At worst, students are forced to be educated about religion, but it's actual education (and not just indoctrination). So the Church becomes at best a stodgy old bit of the government, and nobody likes the government anyway. At worst, it's a reminder of past atrocities committed in its name.\n\nI think the Pledge of Allegiance is similar -- at best, it's said so often it means nothing, which makes it just another stupid boring waste of time imposed by school. At worst, if you actually educate students about the history of this country, it's just a [reminder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny) of [past atrocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears) committed [in its name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soiling_of_Old_Glory).\n\nI'm not saying we should keep it. I'm just saying that today, it's ineffective at best, and might actually be counterproductive.\n\nIt only really becomes problematic when you pair it with [ineffective, dishonest education](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/16/texas-schools-rewrites-us-history), but I think that's a separate problem -- if your \"history\" class promotes god and guns and minimizes the slave trade and the Enlightenment influence to the point of practically pretending Thomas Jefferson didn't exist, then you don't need the Pledge of Allegiance. If anything, the Pledge might run counter to that agenda if you paid attention to the bit about \"indivisible\" or \"liberty and justice for all\".\n\nSecond Response: \nThe United States is a nation of 50 states, all with different cultural backgrounds, but we're all American. The Pledge of Allegiance works as a way to remind all Americans that they are American, regardless of politics, religion, or state.\n  \nLincoln's quote \"united we stand, divided we fall\" is as true today as it was when he said it, and the last time I felt this was on 9/11. Only a few months before, the US was divided. The Bush v Gore race was one of the closest, most contentious presidential races in US history. Extremists on both sides fanned the flames of cultural separation. Liberals saw conservatives as brain-dead ignorant hicks, and conservatives saw liberals as anti-American elitist hippies. The contention between the two was ramping up. I was 22 in 2001. I was in the Gore camp. I didn't like Bush, or the neoconservative platform. I had also never been to New York, though I was dating a woman who was from there.\n  \nWhen 9/11 happened, the news originally broadcasted people falling from the towers. I remember seeing people die on my TV, on every single channel, and it made me angry. It made us all angry. Those were not New Yorkers falling, those were Americans. My countrymen and women. And the rest of the country felt the same way. It didn't matter where you're from, what state, city, backwoods, whatever, we were angry because The United States of America was being attacked. We might bicker and fight, but god help you if you ever attack us.\n  \nI personally feel that the pledge of allegiance is still necessary, now more than ever, because the US is one big dysfunctional family. We need reminders that show us that at the end of the day we're all Americans.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the emotional resonance and personal storytelling found in the Second Response. The responder effectively uses a narrative about a shared traumatic event (9/11) to emphasize national unity, thereby appealing to the original poster\u2019s emotional landscape regarding nationalism. This technique creates a relatable context where national identity is intertwined with a sense of belonging and collective resilience.\n\nIn comparison, the First Response employs a critical and analytical tone with a focus on educational effectiveness and historical context. While it raises valid points about the Pledge of Allegiance being potentially meaningless or counterproductive, it lacks the emotional pull and personal engagement found in the Second Response. Instead of building a bridge with the original poster\u2019s sentiments, it critiques and questions without offering a sense of belonging or community.\n\nThus, the Second Response is more likely to have changed the original poster's view due to its ability to resonate emotionally and reinforce a sense of shared identity, rather than merely questioning the existing ritual.", "is_correct": true}

I've replied to some things and gave out some deltas, but as I won't have time to address everything, I'll summarize in an edit. I think that I already more or less agreed with the principle behind the issue, but I actually misunderstood what the issue was. People aren't so stupid as to think that the things they post online are *private,* but there's a social expectation that you will get information from the source rather than digging up (or participating in) old conversations/content that had nothing to do with you, similar to overhearing a conversation at a restaurant and bringing it up when you meet one of those people later. And then there are better and worse ways to bring up the information you found, if it's a good idea to bring it up at all. In a way some of you have CMV by helping me understand what the problem actually is, so I have posted some deltas. \n\nThanks\n\n-\n\nI don't know if this is much of a phenomenon, but I see it often enough that I have to wonder whether this is the way society's thinking is turning now. \n\nSuppose Susie makes a facebook page, and posts on it pictures of herself and her friends and their activities, some personal trivia, etc. Now her acquaintance Frankie from school mentions in conversation one of the pictures, something she'd said at some point, etc. Susie reacts negatively to this, and calls Frankie a \"creep\" for \"looking through\" her profile. \n\nI'm 24, but as I've been online since sometime during Windows 95, it's been long enough that I'm allowed to have \"good old days\".  And in the good old days, there was no such thing as \"creeping someone's profile\" online. Putting aside when a \"profile\" became a thing. We had web pages, with content we had written, that we wanted as many people as possible to see. We didn't spend all those hours perfecting Javascript mouse trailers and visitor counters and guestbooks for nothing, you know. On these web pages we might have listed all sorts of borderline personally identifying information, or in some cases, all of it. You can still find some super throwback web 1.0 vanity sites where people have straight-up posted their resumes, and more. \n\nSo the same thing happens now, except on Facebook or so, and the difference I can see is that, back when I was a teenager (xanga 4 lyf yo) and we were all doing it, we somehow managed to remember what we had posted on the public internet, and we didn't lose our shit when someone happened to know something that we had told them ... albeit indirectly ... by putting it online ...\n\nI feel like I'm close to the core reason behind this new perspective, but I'm not sure. It's like these people either don't understand how the internet and social media work and are meant to be used in a literal way, or maybe their own metaphors are getting in the way of seeing the reality. Maybe they want their Facebook to be like their high-school bedroom that they've decorated with posters of Ricky Martin, and they have a little diary where they bitch about their poor tragic suburban lives, and nobody else is allowed in there and if you go in and look at their photos or remember too specifically their words, you're a terrible creep, except instead of a bedroom they have erected a large bulletin board in the town square, started posting text and images to it, and got mad when people came to look at them. \n\nCMV? \n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

Going through the half-decade or more of someone's internet history, just for kicks, is eerily voyeuristic, and frankly, makes someone genuinely ask: \"Why the hell would you do that?\"\n\nAfter dating someone for a year, I decided to go to facebook (I'd not been on in years at that point) and I looked my S/O up. I started looking at her photos, and felt weird. Why? Because I had unadulterated access to memories that weren't mine, experiences that I hadn't had, and it created a narrative of someone that they'd not taken the time to share with me. \n\nSo I stopped. \n\nPeople put together online reserves of their memories, and *their memories* are things they want to briefly show off not be scoured later on by someone with nothing better to do. \n\nIt's just creepy to \"creep.\"\n\nSecond Response: \nThere's a book called \"It's complicated: the social lives of networked teens\" that's available as a PDF online that goes into these issues. Apparently kids these days (I'm 32) compartmentalize what they put online by how they intend that information to be received. One premise was that the information is meant to be looked at right then and not gone back through, and that people should self-limit what they read. I think your attitude is the same as mine, in that we understand that there's only one internet, and nothing ever comes off of it.\n\nBecause this is CMV, I'm going to challenge your view now: Teens operate with the idea that their own networked public spaces are the equivalent of a conversation at a food court in a mall. While it is a publicly accessible space owned by a private entity, going through someone's facebook history is equivalent to sitting right next to someone you know at a table and eavesdropping on their conversation. If \"the internet at large\" sees something it's just like some stranger overhearing it - it doesn't matter so there's no drive to keep the data private. However, if \"you\" see it and it's not meant for your consumption (no matter how publicly it was posted) then it's creepy and intrusive of you to find that data.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "Both responses engage with the original post but do so in different tones, styles, and techniques, which influences their effectiveness in changing the original poster's perspective.\n\n**Comparison of Responses:**\n\n**Tone and Emotional Approach:**\n- The **First Response** has a more personal and emotional tone. The responder shares a personal anecdote about feeling uncomfortable while looking at his partner's Facebook photos, conveying a message that resonates on a human level. This emotional appeal engages the reader and makes the point about privacy and voyeurism more immediate and relatable.\n- The **Second Response** adopts a more academic and analytical tone. By referencing a book and presenting a generalized premise about teenagers' online behaviors, it provides a theoretical framework that positions the argument as more overarching and less personal. This might lead the original poster to see the matter more from a societal perspective rather than on an individual level.\n\n**Rhetorical Techniques:**\n- The **First Response** uses a rhetorical question (\u201cWhy the hell would you do that?\u201d) to provoke thought and reflection in the original poster. This technique prompts the reader to consider the motivations behind \"creeping\" and resonates with feelings of discomfort that many may relate to.\n- The **Second Response** uses analogy effectively by comparing browsing someone\u2019s Facebook history to eavesdropping on a private conversation. This literary device helps clarify the argument but may feel less immediate compared to the anecdotal evidence presented in the First Response.\n\n**Sentence Structure and Readability:**\n- The **First Response** is structured in short, clear sentences that enhance readability, making the responder's emotional stance more accessible and impactful.\n- The **Second Response**, while still articulate, presents more complex sentences and thoughts that may require greater focus from the reader, potentially leading to less engagement.\n\n**Engagement with the Original Poster:**\n- The **First Response** directly addresses the \"creepy\" aspect and indicates a personal reflection that feels inviting for the original poster to engage with. It acknowledges the poster's argument but challenges it effectively.\n- The **Second Response**, while offering a counter-narrative, feels more detached and might leave the original poster feeling less connected to the argument. The academic tone may create a barrier rather than foster a dialogue.\n\n**Prediction:**\n$$Answer: First Response$$\n\n**Key Factor(s) Leading to Prediction:**\nThe key factor contributing to this prediction is the emotional resonance of the First Response. By sharing a personal experience and raising relatable concerns about privacy while browsing others' online content, this response creates a space for empathy and reflection that is likely to resonate more profoundly with the original poster.

{"index": 482, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: The window seat is the far superior seat on an airplane.\n\nOriginal Post: \nWhenever I book air travel, I always sit in a window seat, and I contend that the window seat is the far superior seat in almost every way. \n\n1) The views are amazing. The majority of people even 50 years ago had not had the ability to travel by air due to its high cost, and therefore lacked the ability to see the amazing views afforded by sitting at the window of a jet airplane. In my travels, I've been able to look down at the glaciers and coasts of Greenland, see the Grand Canyon from the air, look down on Niagara Falls, appreciate the rolling green hills of New Zealand, and behold the grandeur of the Rocky Mountains. And this is all in less than a decade of regular air travel, and I'm not even counting the fact that just about EVERY view from the air is amazing, even if it's just the cornfields of Nebraska. The longer I keep flying, the more amazing perspective about the beauty and scale of our planet I will be able to appreciate.\n\n2) A place to rest your head to nap. When you have an overnight flight, or a really early flight, and you just need to catch some extra ZZZs on the plane, the window seat is the best place to be because you can ball up your jacket and use it as a pillow against the wall.\n\n3) Elbow and foot protection. The few times I've been unfortunate enough to sit in the aisle seat, I almost always get bumped on my elbow or foot by the drink cart coming down the aisle. It's just such a narrow aisle, and the cart takes up the entire width, that it's bound to hit you at some point, especially if your shoulders are a little wider, or if you're engrossed in a book or headphones and can't hear them asking everyone to move. In the window seat, this is never a problem and you don't risk getting bumped. \n\n4) Control of the window shade. Sometimes it does get really bright outside, and in that case, the person in the window seat has complete control over how high or low to keep the shade. You get to set it at the level that's comfortable for YOU. \n\n5) Not having to get up to let others in during boarding. When I get on the plane, I like to sit down and use those few minutes to answer some emails or text messages, or (admittedly) scroll through Reddit's front page a bit. When sitting in a window seat, once you're seated, you're done. You can sit there uninterrupted for the whole duration of boarding. If you're seated in the aisle or middle, you run the risk of being interrupted and having to stand up, clog the crowded aisle, and losing time to do the things you were doing while waiting for boarding.\n\nNow I'll admit there are a couple problems with the window seat:\n\n1) No easy access to lavatory. You have to ask two other people to get up when you need to use the bathroom. However, I think that with some good advance planning, one can use the bathroom in the terminal and not have to use it at all on a shorter flight. For longer flights, is it really that bad to have to ask someone to get up for a minute to let you out? They know you'll need to go at some point, so as long as it isn't every 20 minutes, I think it's totally fine. And if it really bothers you to inconvenience strangers, you can wait until the middle seat person needs to use the lavatory, and then just go at that point when the aisle person is already getting up. \n\n2) Can't stand up when the plane parks to get your luggage first and/or stretch your legs. But this doesn't seem like such a problem. I mean, you've just been seated for a number of hours on the flight...what's 10 more minutes? Just wait patiently for the aisle to clear, then grab your bag.\n\nIn summary: I believe the window seat is clearly the superior choice when flying. It's not perfect, but on balance, it affords the most interesting scenery, the most comfort, and the most convenience. \n\nThe reason I'd be interested to have my view changed is for those times when I may be stuck in an aisle seat for reasons outside my control, and I'd like to know the reasons why it's not so bad to have to sit on the aisle and not feel like my entire flying experience is ruined by not getting the window seat. \n\nI think we can all agree that sitting in the middle seat is an unsatisfying and degrading experience in every possible way. \n\nEdit: a word\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV!

This is a bit overrated, it's nice to see the windows for awhile, but after a few flights it loses it's novelty and is just annoying. Not to mention if you get it over the wing, it'll ruin your view.\n\n2. This is a good point, but I will argue, that basically getting up during a long flight is much more worthwhile. Doing flights over the Atlantic always made it so much nicer to be able to stand-up and walk around a bit, maybe stand for a few moments. If I'm stuck in the window seat I have to bother other passengers to let me out, and this becomes a bit of a pain, especially if they're sleeping. I don't like inconveniencing other people, and the aisle seat gives you much more freedom in that regard. You will never sleep more than maybe an hour or two, and even that if you're lucky. \n\n3. I've never experienced that, but I'll concede this point. \n\n4. Usually, since the aisle seat is removed from the shade, you're not effected by it at all. \n\n5. There is an even better solution for this one. Instead of waiting in the seat and rushing onto the plane, and potentially inconveniencing a person seating on the isle seat, this basically allows you to do all that browsing/email checking, but in the comfort of the airplane lobby. While everyone is getting boarded, you're free to wait around until the queue to get on the plane is almost completely empty. You don't need to rush on your plane at all, and once you reach your seat, you just have to sit down. Aisle seat allows you the luxury to take your time, not inconvenience anyone, including yourself and actually get more effective time in the lobby instead of on the plane. There's absolutely not a single good reason to board early and be in front of the line. \n\nOne point that you have missed is luggage access, if you realized mid-flight you have something in your on-board luggage you'd like to access, it's much easier to do so from the aisle seat. \n\nAnother is, that if you're in the emergency exit row (the one with the extra leg room) the aisle seat absolves you of some moral responsibility when it comes to crashing. You don't want to be the person who couldn't open the emergency exit... \n\nSecond Response: \nNot sure if this is an issue on larger planes, but on the mid-sized ones (less than 100 passengers) I've only ever been on this would be my simple counter.\n\n1. The window seat gets really cold. I dislike the cold and it gets uncomfortably so, especially in the colder parts of the year. You need some layers to fly from Fargo to Chicago in the window seat.\n\n2. The view thing is kind of nullified at night, most of my flights have been at night and though it's cool for flying over cities, most of the time you can't really see anything. \n\n3. If you're near the engines you have to deal with more noise/vibration if you're in the window seat as opposed to if you were in the aisle. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction include the second response's more relatable and personalized emotional approach.

The second response also uses concise language, making the reading easier and more relatable. Furthermore, it directly addresses comfort-related issues that many travelers face (coldness, noise), thus creating a stronger connection with individuals who may question the ideal of a window seat.\n\nThe second response effectively provides counterpoints relevant to everyday flying experiences, which may resonate more with the original poster's experiences and concerns about sitting in an aisle seat.", "is_correct": true}

Independence Day doesn't claim to be telling a true story.  These fear mongers on the other hand are presenting themselves as experts.  See the difference?  It's the same reason a sci-fi movie about aliens visiting ancient Egypt would be goofy entertainment, but the History Channel's Ancient Aliens is a disgraceful, misleading, embarrassing series.  It claims to be discussing a possibly legitimate truth; therefore it transitions from mere entertainment to actively misleading the public for profit. \n\nEveryone is happy about their beliefs.  Racists, Nazis, ISIS, you name it.  Feeling good about your beliefs doesn't mean your propaganda should be \"applauded.\"  Attitudes have an impact on society.\n\nIf parents stop trusting medical science because of unqualified internet stars claiming to be \"experts\" and spouting superstitious, baseless misinformation, there will be tragic consequences.  Outbreaks of completely preventable infectious diseases.  Kids not getting treatment they need because of fear of doctors.  In some cases hippie food movements driven by fear can have similarly tragic consequences (see the \"raw milk\" movement, which puts people at risk of contracting very dangerous infections from unpasteurized milk).\n\nIt doesn't matter if it makes people happy to be told outright lies for profit, that's not the point.  The point is that it's morally wrong to spread lies that put people in danger, especially children.\n\nIf a parent truly wants to feel better, they should listen to people who actually spend their lives trying to develop real, testable, concrete cures to disease.  People who spend their entire working careers in labs intensively studying the disorders that cause so much suffering.  Not TV talking heads who act as if the scientific establishment is some sort of corporate monster whose goal is to poison food and children.\n\nSecond Response: \nOver [200,000 deaths are associated with preventable medical errors.](http://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx) You know who prevented a lot of these medical errors? The patients. But that's not possible in a world where popularity trumps knowledge. \n\nWhen people adopt counter- and non-scientific opinions, massaged into fact-shaped blurbs by TV charlatans, they replace reason with rationalization. They become trained to accept utterly arbitrary data based on how well it soothes their mind and conforms to their biases rather than the outcome of clinical trials. And when the real scientific process, ugly, slow, and unintuitive, rears its head, they become hostile towards it. \n\nCharlatans crave ignorance, and when their audiences accept their roles as empty-headed children, unworthy of and uninterested in knowledge of the real world, our society becomes ever more dangerous. \n\nBasic ethical concepts in medicine like [\"informed consent\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informed_consent) become impossible. We make medical decisions totally ignorant of the process and disconnected from the principles. Media panics and trends steal our attention and squander our limited ability to care for our personal health. Blinded by lies and deprived of tools, we rely on luck and chance.  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with false hope in impossible situations. But these are not impossible situations. This is nutrition. These are basic, daily concerns, containing no harsh or unbearable truths. Yes, there is a degree of comfort in being told what you want to hear. But the same is true of opium.

{"index": 484, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Trying to save the pandas is a waste of time, money, and resources. We should let them go extinct.\n\nOriginal Post: \nFirst off, I like pandas I think they are cute and interesting; however, I think we should let that species meet whatever natural end is coming. Many valuable resources are devoted to saving the panda because pandas are extremely well known and popular, not because they have a good chance of survival.   Here are the reasons I believe this:\n  \n1) Pandas have lost much of their natural habitat due to the population explosion in China.  While this is regrettable, it is not likely to get fixed anytime soon. This means that even if we are able to revive this species they won't have anywhere to live.   \n  \n2) pandas, as a species, have chosen poorly. They are carnivorous animals who's main diet is bamboo. Their digestion can only process about 5% of the stuff in bamboo. That means they have to eat huge amounts of bamboo everyday. With the reduced habitat this is getting harder and harder. Either they need some microevolutionary shift to eat more nutritious sources of food orthey should join the likes of the dodo bird.   \n  \n3) human efforts to revive the population have shown some increases, but at what cost? It is incredibly difficult to get pandas to mate with one another, it's like they don't even want their species to survive. I get they aren't actually making this choice, this is just a facetious way of saying that their instincts and biology do not support the kind of growth in population hey need. Hell, half of their births are twins and the mother almost always lets one die because she doesn't produce enough milk. I realize this would take evolution to fix and this problem is way too short term, but it means that their survival requires an exorbanant amount of human intervention. Since their is a finite amount of resources conservationists can dedicate to endangered resources they are killing other more likely to survive species.  \n  \n4) I'm not saying we should encourage the decline of the panda. We should still try to preserve what habitat they have left and ban hunting them, but they are so far gone and require so much help that we shouldnt waste too many resources on them. Let the panda try to support a small and natural population without our interference. If they cannot achieve this goal, I don't think it's worth the resources to help them grow.\n\nFirst Response: \nI don't think it's a waste of money. In short, we conserve pandas because people like them. Whoever spends the money on keeping pandas around has already considered this, and he thinks it's worth it.\n\nMany other things, such as music and balloons could be considered a waste of resources if people didn't like them.\n\nSecond Response: \nThe WWF wants to promote biodiversity in a variety of things other than Pandas. However, average people who are interested in donating tend to care disproportionately more about pandas and other cute animals. Supporters may donate solely on an emotional desire to keep the pandas alive (in the face of the points outlined in your OP), but that doesn't mean the the WWF can't allocate the funds to less sexy, harder to advertise causes that might not attract the same financial support. That's to say that in addition to the intrinsic social and environmental value of saving pandas, the WWF can do more good across the board with the money that is donated with the pandas in mind.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "To analyze both responses, we will examine the stylistic elements, which include tone and emotional approach, rhetorical techniques, sentence structure and readability, and engagement with the original poster (OP).\n\n### Tone and Emotional Approach:\n- **First Response**: The tone is somewhat dismissive of the OP's argument. It counters the statement that conserving pandas is a waste of money by suggesting that the enjoyment and popularity of pandas justifies their conservation. It feels more self-assured and less empathetic towards the concerns raised.\n  \n- **Second Response**: The tone is more nuanced and acknowledges the OP's perspective while introducing the importance of emotional appeals in conservation efforts. It seems to better respect the OP's concerns while exploring the complexity of the issue. \n\n### Rhetorical Techniques:\n- **First Response**: The argument is quite simplistic and relies on an appeal to popularity, suggesting that since people value pandas, the funds spent are justified. However, it does not engage deeply with the OP's rebuttals regarding the species\u2019 viability.\n  \n- **Second Response**: This response employs a more sophisticated argument structure. It discusses the broader implications of conservation funding beyond just pandas and emphasizes emotional engagement as a critical element of fundraising for conservation efforts. This depth adds more credibility to its claim.\n\n### Sentence Structure and Readability:\n- **First Response**: The language is straightforward, but it is somewhat abrupt and lacks in-depth analysis. It feels like a quick rebuttal rather than a fully fleshed-out argument.\n  \n- **Second Response**: The structure is more complex and flows better, making it easier to follow the logic behind the arguments. It engages the reader with more varied sentence structures and concepts.\n\n### Engagement with the Original Poster:\n- **First Response**: There is limited direct engagement, and it does not address specific points raised by the OP. It feels more like a quick dismissal than a conversation.\n  \n- **Second Response**: This response acknowledges the OP's concerns and expands on them, providing additional context about conservation finance. It engages the OP more effectively and invites further reflection.\n\n### Prediction:\n$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\n### Explanation:\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the depth and nuance of the second response, which addresses the OP\u2019s points while providing a more comprehensive counterargument that respects the emotional aspect of conservation. It demonstrates a better understanding of the complexity of the issue at hand and engages more thoughtfully with the concerns presented by the OP, which is more likely to change the original poster's view.", "is_correct": true}

For you, fireworks may not offer much excitement so the risks of physical harm may not be worth the monetary cost or potential danger. However, you must recognize that there are many things which you may find boring but another person may find very entertaining.\n\nFor another person, fireworks may be the shit. They may spend all day and all night fantasizing about them. They may spontaneously orgasm every 4th of July for 5 hours gazing up at the sky. I personally don't understand how people enjoy birdwatching, either, but there's plenty of people who do. You can't possibly quantify what other people like.\n\nFor the people that enjoy fireworks and fireworks shows, the relatively small risk (if you handle them properly) compared to the enjoyment they get from the experience is worth it for them. They are paying for a night which they hold fond in their memories, a sense of wonder, a feeling of pleasure. You may not understand it and may even consider it a waste of time and resources, but that's OK. No one is holding a firecracker to your head and making you enjoy it.\n\nAlso, as a personal anecdote, this isn't terribly uncommon. It seems people either love fireworks or hate them.

Here are the key factors that contributed to this prediction:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response adopts a more conversational and relatable tone, which helps to establish a connection with the original poster. By acknowledging the subjective nature of enjoyment, it gently invites the poster to reconsider their stance without coming off as confrontational. The mention of personal experiences adds a personal touch that softens the critique.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response utilizes the technique of analogy and comparison, suggesting that both fireworks and birdwatching are examples of interests that can vary greatly from person to person. This approach encourages the original poster to see fireworks in a broader context of personal experience and enjoyment, making the argument more compelling.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The second response features varied sentence lengths and structures, which enhances readability. The use of informal phrases and humor (such as \u201cspontaneously orgasm\u201d over fireworks) creates a lighthearted atmosphere that contrasts with the original poster\u2019s more rigid viewpoint.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response actively engages the original poster by recognizing their viewpoint while also presenting a counterargument. It acknowledges the validity of their feelings about fireworks but emphasizes that enjoyment is subjective and personal. This balanced acknowledgment is likely to resonate more with the original poster than the more straightforward first response.\n\nIn summary, the second response's effective use of personal anecdotes, relatable analogies, and a friendly, engaging tone ultimately make it more persuasive and likely to shift the original poster\u2019s view on the topic of fireworks.", "is_correct": false}
{"index": 486, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: I am a circumcised male. I see no issues with the procedure and would circumcise my child if he were born in the U.S. today.\n\nOriginal Post: \nFirst off, as a male who was circumcised at birth, I am glad that I was circumcised.  Any associated pain does not exist to me because I cannot remember it, in the exact same way that pain associated with other surgical procedures I have had under general anesthesia as an adult does not exist because I cannot remember it.\n\nThe WHO currently recommends male circumcision for HIV prevention and \"as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package\".  It is primarily recommended in areas with high incidences of HIV, but given its demonstrated effect at reducing the spread of the virus I prefer to have any added protection possibly available.  I would plan to infer the same protection to any hypothetical children born at this time, especially considering that the complication rates here are significantly lower than in the areas where it is most strongly recommended by the WHO.\n\nLiving in the midwest U.S. it is culturally nearly expected, with 70-80% prevalence.  Because of this, many to most potential sexual partners in my area (including myself, as a gay male) prefer the aesthetic of a circumcised penis.  With the research consensus demonstrating no adverse effects on sexual performance, I see no reason to not stick with the cultural norm. \n\nWhat may help change my view:\n\n* *Scientific studies* demonstrating prolonged psychological damage due to infant male circumcision.\n\n* *Scientific studies* demonstrating that complication rates and severity in the U.S. outweigh potential benefits due to HIV resistance.\n\n* *Scientific* evidence that circumcised males in the U.S. are demonstrably less satisfied with their sex lives than uncircumcised males.\n\nWhat will *not* help change my view:\n\n* \"People should be allowed to chose\".  Parents are wholly responsible for their children's health and well-being until they are capable of making those decisions on their own.  Circumcision complication rates increase dramatically with age.\n\n* \"If everyone stopped doing it, it wouldn't be culturally expected anymore.\" Yeah, not going to happen any time soon.  I am talking the choice for parents to circumcise in areas of the U.S. where it is highly prevalent today.\n\n**TL;DR:  Not traumatized by own circumcision, culturally expected, +1 to HIV prevention. CMV.**\n\nFirst Response: \nFrom what I read, circumcised men have a slightly lower chance to contract HIV when having *unprotected sex*.\n\nHowever, if condoms are used, then there is no difference in the chance to contract HIV.\n\nSo, this means that, in order to get this benefit of circumcision, a man would have to **have unprotected sex with someone who is HIV positive**.\n\nDoes this seem like a \"benefit\" to you? One that is only possible to get if you commit actions that you wouldn't want to do (for good reason)?\n\nConsider that circumcision in itself carries its own risks of injury or even death (as does any operation). So how are those risks justified in return for a benefit that you don't really want to have?\n\n\n\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt; culturally expected\n\nCircumcision rates are far below 50% in every developed country other than the US, and are currently at [~58% and falling](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/circumcision_2013/circumcision_2013.htm). It is no longer \"the norm,\" and a child of either status won't be in the clear majority. \n\n&gt; +1 to HIV prevention\n\nOnly in places like Africa, where condoms are viewed negatively. Condoms are 25x more effective than circumcision, and [circumcised men are less likely to use them.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23514832)\n\n&gt; Circumcision complication rates increase dramatically with age.\n\nDid you know that in infant circumcision, sexual dysfunction is not counted as a complication even if it stems directly from the circumcision? \n\n[More on neonatal circumcision complications.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253617/) \n\n&gt; 7.4% of all visits to a pediatric urologist were for circumcision complications. \n\nSo there's a demonstrable chance that the procedure can actually cause problems where previously there were none. \n\nEDIT: \n\nAs for the psychological impact, there is little research on the matter. What we do know is that [circumcision is correlated with a 50% increase in risk of alexithymia.](http://www.biomedsearch.com/article/Alexithymia-circumcision-trauma-preliminary-investigation/271664388.html) \n\nEnough evidence to at least warrant erring on the side of caution, and not doing it to a child. \n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Engagement**: The second response adopts a more fact-based and data-driven tone while directly addressing the original poster's points with researched information. This approach encourages critical thinking and presents factual challenges that could lead the original poster to reconsider their stance. In contrast, the first response\u2019s tone is more confrontational and dismissive regarding the \"benefits\" of circumcision, which might put the original poster on the defensive rather than encouraging dialogue.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response effectively employs rhetorical questioning and counters the original points with statistics and references to studies, which can incite doubt and prompt reflection. By addressing specific assertions made by the original poster and backing them with external evidence, it creates a sense of informed debate. The first response, while raising valid concerns about the risks of circumcision, lacks this depth of evidence and direct engagement with the poster's claims.\n\n3. **Logical Appeal**: The second response systematically dismantles the original poster\u2019s justifications, providing data that challenges the cultural expectation and claimed health benefits of circumcision in the U.S. This logical approach paired with cited studies might resonate more with the original poster than the emotional response presented in the first response.\n\nOverall, the second response's thorough engagement, data-backed challenges, and respectful yet assertive tone are likely to be more persuasive in altering the original poster's view on circumcision.", "is_correct": true}

Now I don't have a PhD in psychology or anything, but there is evidence beyond proof that people want what they can't have. It's just human nature, and I feel like it's what's behind the longterm desire for coffee in that something I was once barred from is now freely enjoyed and encouraged. It doesn't help that many people jack their cups with sugars and creams which at a certain point require speculation as to which substance is actually fueling your perceived energy boost.\n\nI consider myself to be very openminded, especially when it comes to substances put into the body for recreational purposes (I'll leave it at that) but I can't seem to see eye-to-eye to my friends that have been religiously trying to convert me all these years.\n\nThe extent of my coffee experience would be instant coffee growing up at home (parents weren't 'connoisseurs' by any iteration of the term but were both pretty addicted to), pretentious (shots fired) coffee shops that my fiends would literally drag me to, and the occasional tinder date Starbucks run in which I would just end up getting the vanilla bean frappe 90% of the time, which is delicious by the way.\n\nIt seems to me like the most elite coffee drinkers in my socials circles tend to hate Starbucks. Maybe because they think it's cool to do so and are attempting to show everyone how much they know about how coffee should taste like.\n\nCould that be the reason? Have I just had bad coffee?

There are different flavors of coffee, and knowing what you like, I can make a recommendation as to a coffee you may like.\n\nSecond Response: \nIf anything the effects of coffee are understated. When coke became taboo, coffee became the 'business mans' drug. \n\nCaffeine is a drug. Just like any other drug, the high becomes addictive. which is why your friends enjoy the taste so much. When I stated smoking pot, I didn't care much for the taste and thought everyone was crazy when they were talking about different strands and their effects. After years of smoking pot I get it. Same thing with coffee. \n\nHaving a morning cup of coffee every morning is very similar to taking a quick hit of coke every morning. You become more alert, focused, and have quick burst of energy. 2 or 3 hours go by and your artificial high goes down, then you start to crave coffee again. \n\nSo if you start thinking of your friends as drug addicts maybe some of their behaviors would make more sense to you.  \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "To determine which response might successfully change the original poster's view, we will analyze the two responses based on the specified stylistic elements.\n\n### Analysis of the Responses\n\n**First Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone of the first response is somewhat casual and inviting.

It maintains focus on clarifying the original poster's experience with specific coffee types.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** The responder directly engages with the original post by referencing specific points about the types of coffee the poster has tried. This creates a personalized touch that makes the responder seem genuinely interested in the poster's viewpoint.\n\n**Second Response:**\n- **Tone and Emotional Approach:** The tone is a bit harsher and more aggressive. By comparing caffeine addiction to drug use, it conveys a critical stance that may alienate the original poster rather than foster understanding.\n- **Rhetorical Techniques:** The responder employs analogies comparing caffeine to more hardcore drugs like coke and marijuana. Although this technique could effectively emphasize the addictive nature of coffee, it may also come off as dismissive of the original poster's experience and feelings towards coffee.\n- **Sentence Structure and Readability:** The sentence structure includes longer sentences with complex ideas, which may make it slightly harder to digest quickly in the flow of a conversation. This complexity could detract from its persuasiveness.\n- **Engagement with the Original Poster:** This response does engage with the idea of addiction but does so in a manner that might not resonate with the original poster\u2019s reflections on coffee flavors or personal experiences.

Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to \"why.\"\n\n2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in \"ly\" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.\n\n3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. \n\n4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). \n\n5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. \n\n6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. \n\n7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. \n\n8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even \"American History X.\"\n\n9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, \n\n10. = X. \n\n11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states.

I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior.

It can be similarly made with an -ecs or -ecks if you want. There's no way to reproduce the sound of y.\n\n2)  Exclusivity does not mean something is better. X is certainly used less, which I would argue makes it a more useless letter. If you could have a key that opens 10 treasure chests, or a key that opens 20, which would you choose? Certainly the more useful one.\n\n3) X may always be a consonant, but it also doesn't always sound the same. Sometimes it's an -ecs sound, sometimes it's a z sound. \"xylophone\" and \"for example\"\n\n4)  X is only worth so many points because of it's uselessness. It's like getting paid to take the worst player in sports. Only Q is more useless in scrabble, so much so that they had to add the u to it.\n\n5)  As others have said, X works for Y. It's like the factory worker and the boss. Who gets paid more? Even so, eventually the greek letters beat all of them out.\n\n6)  Y may be more unstable, but it can easily be pounded into the ground like a stake. The X isn't as easy. Or it could just stand there. I've never seen one fall over, so it must be quite talented at standing there.\n\n7)  The X in sex is great, I'll admit that. However, you also need consent.

Nobody wants it in their state name. It's unamerican.\n\n12)  It is wrong to claim that any unknown item is better than any other unknown item. Y is being humble here, and X is being an asshole.\n\nSecond Response: \nIn your arguments you make a lot of assumptions about what better means. For instance you presume that rarity is 'better' than versatility.  The letter Y is far more versatile than the letter X, it can be used in many more words and is flexible enough to stand in for vowels when using them makes a word look horrible.  On that basis the letter Y also has great aesthetic appeal.\n\nYou assume that consistency is better when versatility could just as easily be argued to be better.\n\nYou assume that having the word ex in sex is good, but in order to describe the magnitude of sex something exudes you need to add the y on the end (sexy).\n\nNumber 11 is just plan false as I'm sure many people die each year in Texas, and New Mexico.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are the tone, emotional approach, and engagement with the original poster's arguments.

Both countries have had conflicts and have very nearly gone to war in multipal occasions in resent years. Honestly India and Pakistan are the major place most people point to when speaking on the dangers of nukes. These countries have not stooped being confrontational with each other and armed conflicts still happen. The biggest problem is now other major countries need to join early into the conflicts because they both have nukes. \n\nEdit\n\n[To give a better understanding both countries had nukes by 1999 and still ended up in war with each other.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War) \n\n[Also here is the wiki page listing conflict they have had listing things as resent as last year with all equally likely to lead to both counties nuking each other.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts#Other_armed_engagements)\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;  The same happened with Pakistan and India, they both hated each other, and fought several wars, but once they both got nukes, they stopped fighting because they knew it wasn\u2019t worth the cost of being nuked.\n\nNot quite. In 1999 the two countries engaged in the [Kargil War (or Kargil Conflict)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kargil_War#WMDs_and_the_nuclear_factor), and this was after both countries had tested their nuclear weapons in 1998. It was later revealed that Pakistan did not have launch capabilities at the time, but they did engage in exercises that *signaled* their intent. As did the other side. In fact, there was talk of a \"limited\" nuclear war that would stop short of MAD, but would lead to massive damage to both countries. What I'm trying to argue against is your point that: \n\n&gt;  CMV: Nuclear weapons could end warfare, at least between nation states.\n\nHaving nuclear weapons would not end conventional warfare b/w warring states, so there would still be loss of life and property without the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd there's also the fact that if every country in the world had nuclear weapons there's no way to assume that each would use it responsibly. Not every nation is as politically developed as the current cache of countries that do possess these weapons. Even now, there's huge risk of proliferation. What if one country sold (or supplied) its weapons to some terrorist agency? The best answer to the question of nuclear weapons, in my opinion, is to move towards a world without these weapons in the hands of nations.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to my prediction are the tone and engagement techniques used in the second response.

It doesn't really add up for that much, and it is outweighed for how much extra the consumer spends due to being misled. Stores wouldn't do it otherwise.\n\nI would find it hard to believe that the prices are caused by competition and market equilibrium (i.e. that it would be rationally cheaper to buy at the $599.99 store than the $600 store). It would be a huge coincidence if it turned out that the \"real market price\" just happened to stop at that arbitrary .99 point. Furthermore, it appears that monopolies such as airport snack shops are doing it as well, and they have no competition.\n\nTherefore, I argue that it has no benefit to the consumer and it is done in bad faith. Of course, the consumer ought to be responsible when buying, but a practice like this very intentionally exploits such moments of minor inattention. This gives it grounds to be banned.\n\nI can see how that might cause problems with prices like $19,900, but not with anything below one dollar difference.\n\nIf you are a laissez-faire fellow such as myself who might believe that it is the store's natural right to set whatever price it wants for whatever reason, then fine, although it would be very low on the priority list of excessive regulations.

In fact, forcing one to have sex when they don't want to is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to things that are unacceptable to do to a person without his or her permission. Telling someone that they can't get a medical procedure done (or, likewise, telling that they HAVE to get a medical procedure done) is just as awful as is dictating how they were their hair or how they dress.

Forcing another person to only have sex with you seems to me like an awfully controlling behavior and takes away the body autonomy that they should have. \n\nI can understand if a couple decides between the two of them that would like to sleep exclusively with each other. It's just surprising to me at times that it is the norm to be mad enough at your SO to break up with them if they have sex with someone outside of the relationship. I understand that people cheat all the time, but open relationships just seem to be the exception rather than the norm. \n\nIf you want a monogamous relationship and your SO sleeps with someone else, then you shouldn't be mad at your SO. You should simply realize that you guys want different things out of a relationship and part ways. Getting angry would be controlling your SO and taking away his or her own control over his or her own body. \n\nAnd just for clarification: I am not saying that everyone should go out and cheat on their SOs. I am more stating that it *should* be normal and acceptable for people to have sex with people outside of a two person relationship for no other reason than that it is oddly controlling to insist that your SO sleep with no one besides you. \n\nAlso, I wanted to point out that I am purposefully not using particular genders.

Rarely do you hear about anything orange though, outside of being a garnish or in liquers. Apples are the full feature alcohol fruit that can come in cider or wine form, as well and being used in the same fashions oranges could, liquers and garnishes. No one orders an orange wine because they just aren't common, and that's because they aren't very good! Apple is even sometimes used in beer, albeit orange is more common for that.\n\nFood: oranges are pretty good for food, salads sauces and such, but what about an orange pie? As an American the apple pie is a quintessential food associated with America. That may not sway non Americans, with that I say, what about pork? You don't put an orange in a pigs mouth when you roast it, nope that's an apple. Both can be used in a variety of ways, but pie and pork gives apple the advantage.\n\nDiversity: apples have over 7,000 varieties, oranges don't even come close to that. \n\nJuice: both make fine juices, but apple has far more variety to create a wide appeal.

{"index": 493, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Gender fluidity is not a thing.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIn response to this [article](http://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a28865/ruby-rose-oitnb/). I believe you can be a man or a woman or trans, and you can be any sexual orientation you want under the rainbow! Every persons orientation is a little nuanced. I don't believe you're gender can be nuanced. You are a man or a woman, whether you were born that way or you underwent physical changes later in life because you knew deep down that you were a man/woman under the skin you were born in. I don't believe you can make a daily choice to identify as a different gender. So you are a girl who hates skirts? You aren't a man because of that, you are just a girl who hates skirts. Not conforming to gender roles doesn't mean that you have the choice to identify yourself as a different gender whenever you please.   \nWhen a trans person switches, they have to jump through all sorts of hoops to legally be a gender. If we recognized \"gender fluidity\" all sorts of problems could arise, such as \"which change room should I use?\". Would it just change depending on how they were feeling that day? Would we all be okay with men, deciding that they are more of a woman today, going into female change rooms and stripping down in front of children?  \nI don't believe that people really feel the need to change their genders on a daily basis, and I don't agree with those who would try to force me to respect their \"fluid\" gender. There is already a term for people who don't conform to gender stereotypes and it's androgyny. I consider myself to be a very open person, especially when it comes to other peoples personal choices that don't affect me so please CMV.  \nEDIT: u/Paimon has changed my view about gender fluidity being a thing. It's a thing. I still disagree with most of you saying there are no legal or social ramifications though, especially about the change rooms, and on how to address someone who is gender fluid.    \nEDIT 2: A lot of people are trying to change my view based on what they think the world should be like (i.e gender neutral bathrooms and change rooms) rather than being realistic about what it actually is (women have to be guarded in order to protect themselves from sexual harassment.) I still don't believe that men with biological man parts should be allowed to waltz into a women's change room because they are feeling like a woman that day, and that I should just trust that they know better than I do what their gender is when their dick is in my face.  \nThat being said I understand how they is a good term over he/she. It sounds weird to call a girl a they but if someone asked me to refer to them that way, obviously I would. \n\nFirst Response: \nI am by no means an expert, I've just been really interested in gender/sexuality issues for a while and I'll explain it how it makes sense to me. So please if someone is reading this and I am wrong, correct me please!! \n\nI look at this in 3 categories: sex, gender, and sexuality. I see sex as being your physical situation, sexuality being who you are attracted to, and gender being how you feel inside. Sex, to me, can be male, female, intersex, or any combination thereof. This is fairly straightforward and there aren't many arguments about this, I think.\n\nSexuality is the next easiest one, and it seems like you understand this one pretty similarly to how I do. A little nuance here is the separation of sexual attraction and romantic attraction, so for example you can want to be romantic with people but totally uninterested in sex (heteroromantic, asexual). These two things are important in defining gender.\n\nI'm gonna talk about transgender people for a minute as a preface to gender. Generally, transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, which is recognized in the [DSM-V](http://www.dsm5.org/documents/gender%20dysphoria%20fact%20sheet.pdf) (it used to be called gender identity disorder until this edition of the DSM), and take steps to alleviate it by either transitioning (hormones, surgery) or presenting (binders, makeup, clothes) as another gender. Transgender people have symptoms of gender dysphoria, and more often than not, they have serious body dysphoria as well,  where they feel disgusted by their bodies or just feeling \"wrong\" in their skin. It's a horrible place to be mentally and can lead to serious depression and self harm. That's why hormone replacement therapy is important, because it tries to eliminate body dysphoria or at least tone it down a few notches. I bring this up because gender fluidity is basically the same thing, except gender fluid people either do not have body dysphoria or they do not experience it to the same degree. They have the same feelings of \"wrongness\" about aligning their gender with their sex, and personally I think this has a lot to do with how pervasive gender roles are in society.  \n\nThere are *lots* of classes of gender fluidity, and while some of them are fluid on a day-to-day basis like you described, the more common varieties tend to sit somewhere in the middle. The [Genderbread Person](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2015/03/the-genderbread-person-v3/) (with a more in-depth explanation [here](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/03/the-genderbread-person-v2-0/)) is a really awesome illustration that you can play around with. It's a combination of identity (how you feel) and expression (how you present), using socially defined gender norms of femininity and masculinity.\n\nAn important thing to keep in mind is, when we are looking at issues like restrooms or changing rooms, is that individuals who are genderfluid are not \"men going in a women's bathroom\" or \"women in a man's changing room,\" because I feel like that has more of a predatory connotation. It's really up to the individual which one they want to use. In my opinion, changing rooms are not a big deal, but restrooms go by what you present as (ex. if you are a trans-man, you use a stall in the men's restroom). (As mentioned in another comment, gender neutral restrooms are the best way to solve this I think, and more and more public places are starting to implement them which is really awesome!!)\n\nThe way I look at it is like, since hormone therapy requires recommendations from doctors and therapists, legally identifying as genderfluid should be managed the same way.\n\nSecond Response: \nGender is a physical thing. People tend to say things like sex is what is in your pants, and gender is what's in your head. Or that gender is just a social construct (it turns out that sex is also a social construct, but it's a bit complicated, and not part of this post).\n\nSo, when someone has an intersex condition they have either ambiguous genitalia, gonads or chromosomes. Currently the brain isn't included in the definition of intersex. That said, there is pretty [strong evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_transsexualism#Brain_structure) that being trans is a neurological condition. In my opinion it should be considered a congenital neurological intersex condition.\n\nNow, if you read the first few paragraphs you'll find out two things: first, the BSTc is hormone aplastic (it doesn't change shape based on the level of sex hormones), and second, that it doens't differentiate until adulthood, but we have trans people being certain about their gender well before then, so we have to look elsewhere for a cause (at least for early onset gender things).\n\nIf the BSTc doesn't change shape, then it's obviously not relevant to genderfluidity, though being part way between the two sizes might account for gender being looser than normal. But what about the parts of the brain that are sensitive to sex hormones and do change based on the pretense or absence of E or T? [This article](http://www.eje-online.org/content/155/suppl_1/S107.full) talks about the parts of the brain that *do* change based on hormone therapy. If someone's brain is not especially solidified because of the aplasitc parts being somewhere in the middle, then slight hormone fluctuations could well switch identity from one side to another. I'm not saying that that *is* how it works, since it's not a thing that has been studied all that much, but it's certainly well within the realm of possibility based on what we do know about gender.\n\nAndrogyny is based on appearance, and not identity.

I have seen the tranquilizer guns making animals unable to even move, so wouldn't they be quite useful? Thanks to this, they could've shoot the suspect without worrying about killing him/her, and accidents where the innocent people are dying wouldn't happen. Plus, even if the suspect is really guilty, a police officer shouldn't kill him/ her, right? And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier? They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators.

We have to estimate the weight of the animal and put the correct amount of the drug in the needle.  While a good drug can account by us being off by a bit, it does not account for the danger of using a dose for a creature twice the size or bigger.  As humans have a large range of potential body sizes, that means that the police would not be able to have the darts pre-loaded and ready to go, but rather have to load up a dart with the drug while in pursuit and estimating their size.  That changes the time between deciding to use the weapon and using it from a few seconds to a few minutes (if not longer), which can mean the difference between life and death in a situation where using either weapon is needed.\n\n&gt;And if something happens like in the scenes we see in the movies, where the criminal takes a hostage and police officers can't shoot because they are afraid of hurting the hostage, wouldn't this make everything easier?  They could've just shoot without worrying about anything, and make both the hostage and the criminal collapse?\n\nA 250 lbs man holding a 100 lbs woman still means that if she gets a dart meant for him in her, she will likely die.\n\nSecondly, even in a perfectly healthy subject, there is a great deal of possibility of complications.  These drugs work by relaxing the muscles and/or paralyzing them, but that also applies to muscles like the diaphragm and heart.  When sedating an animal, we have to closely monitor their breathing and temperature to make sure that the drug is not causing problems and potentially administer counter agents.\n\nThird, many humans already have drugs in their system, both legal and illegal.  Without knowing exactly what they have in them, it is impossible to know how the tranquilizer will interact.  It may make it useless, it may make it deadly, it may drive them into a berserker rage.  Without their medical history in from of us and a pharmacist, we cannot know.\n\nFourth, tranquilizers take a while to take effect.  It sometimes takes as long as several minutes after the drugs enter their system for it to impact them.  With an animal, we can easily sit back and observe them from a distance until they collapse, but with a criminal it will just give him a few minutes of doing whatever dangerous activity he is already engaged in.  Some people may react to being hit by a dart with anger and become more violent.  Also, if they happen to know the drug the police use, they may have a syringe of a counter-agent with them and be able to use the time to nullify the effect.\n\nFifth, darts are far less accurate than a regular bullet.  Distance must be carefully estimated and applied to whatever launcher is used.  Overestimating distance means the dart will not hit with enough force and not penetrate skin or will drop too much and miss entirely.  Underestimating distance means the dart not dropping enough and overshooting the target or hitting and doing severe damage with the impact.  This means that the chances of the police hitting their target at all are very low, and they must engage from a much shorter distance.\n\nFinally, the darts are very difficult to get to inject even when they hit the target.  Often times simply fur is enough to stop a successful hit from injecting the drug and cause it to simply spray the outside of the animal.  A heavy coat, leather jacket, or a wide range of other possible clothing options can easily do the same thing and prevent the drug from entering the system of the target even on an accurate shot.\n\nOverall, if I am going up against gun bearing criminal with either a tranquilizer gun or a baseball bat, I will take the bat because I will be more likely to win and I will be less likely to kill the criminal in the event of a victory.\n\nSecond Response: \nHave you ever seen an anesthesiologist's paycheck? They get paid a lot, and a huge portion of what they get paid goes straight to malpractice insurance. This is because it's not easy to knock someone out, and it's even harder to do it without hurting or killing them. \n\nI'm no expert on tranquilizers but I know they are not the instant knock out guns movies make them appear to be. You have to get the drug in their system and it needs time to work. Time a person could use any number of ways, some dangerous.\n\nAlso, more importantly in my opinion, you're putting the person shot a risk. You're injecting an unfamiliar drug into their system. They could be allergic, or it could have an averse reaction with some other legal or illegal drug that they're taking. It could hurt them, cause permanent damage, or even kill them.\n\nI fully believe in finding a solution to police killings, but this just isn't it.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe key factors that led to this prediction are as follows:\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The second response utilizes a more relatable and down-to-earth tone, appealing to shared concerns about safety. It emphasizes the risks associated with tranquilizers in a way that connects directly with the original post's call for safer police practices. In contrast, the first response adopts a technical and somewhat clinical tone, which might alienate the original poster rather than engage them on an emotional level.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The second response effectively uses a personal anecdote about anesthesiologists and their malpractice insurance to underline the complexity and dangers of administering tranquilizers. This technique draws on common knowledge and makes the issue more accessible. The first response, while detailed, offers more of a logical rebuttal without such relatable context.\n\n3. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The second response acknowledges the original poster's intent to find a solution to police killings, reinforcing a shared goal. It offers empathy by saying, \u201cI fully believe in finding a solution to police killings,\u201d which validates the original poster\u2019s concerns.

{"index": 496, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: Prescriptivism\n\nOriginal Post: \nI've been studying Linguistics as an undergraduate for about 8 months or so now, so this one is important to me academically. In discussions of language, there are typically two camps into which people fall: prescriptivism, and descriptivism. Prescriptivists, think your typical grammarian, David Crystal, Lynne Truss, etc., correcting people's grammar, getting fussy about punctuation, insisting upon proper pronunciation. At the heart of prescriptivism is the idea that there is a way that language *should* be spoken. Descriptivism, on the other hand, argues that there is no such thing as \"correct\" language, that what prescriptivists call \"mistakes\" are just non-standard varieties, and that we shouldn't ever make judgements about people's language.\n\nLinguistics is whole-heartedly and almost exceptionlessly (AFAIK) descriptivist, and as a student, I recognise its importance. The view that there is any single \"correct\" variety of language is obviously misleading from the beginning: which variety? Who says X dialect is better than Y dialect? And judgements against language, I-believe-it-was-Peter Trudgill argued, are actually judgements against people's social class, as supposedly \"incorrect\" language features are often described by the upper classes as being used by the lower classes. And I do mostly agree with it.\n\nBut. While I understand all this, I find it difficult to truly shake off the claws of prescriptivism. In particular, the idea that there isn't any \"correct\" language. For example:\n\n\"He _went_ to the shops\"\n\"He _gone_ to the shops\"\n\nI can accept that in some English dialects, the past participle of \"go\" is \"gone\" instead of \"went\". That's not a mistake. But then take a sentence like:\n\n\"Shops went the he to\"\n\nThis isn't syntactically valid: it doesn't parse as a sentence. You might just be understood, but more likely you would confuse everybody with this sentence, so it fails as communication. If this sentence both isn't a valid sentence, and can't be understood, what other word to describe it than \"incorrect\"? It can't be a valid form of language if almost nobody understands it, surely.\n\nSo what I'm really seeking, is to understand how sentences like the above can fit into the framework of descriptivism, and for someone to convince me that we can't describe sentences like the above as \"wrong\". Please VCM.\n\n_____\n\n&gt; *Hello, users of CMV! This is a footnote from your moderators. We'd just like to remind you of a couple of things.

Descriptivism does not say that all mistakes are just non-standard varieties. What it is really does is identify dialectical differences and find the underlying structures of grammatical language. So, descriptivism is *describing* the universal rules of a language, whereas prescriptivism is *prescribing* an ideal standard for a language. \n\nIn regards to your example sentences, in english, a sentence needs to have an SVO structure in order to be grammatical. This is not only a prescriptive view, but also descriptive, because it is an observable phenomenon that is universal across the english language. So when you use the sentences: \n\n*\"He went to the shop\"* and *\"He gone to the shop\"*, both are following an SVO pattern, and are thus grammatical in terms of descriptivism. \n\nHowever, when you consider the sentence \"Shops went the he to\", this would be considered ungrammatical by descriptivists, because it uses an OVS structure, which is not grammatical in English. \n\nSo I think the main thing that might be confusing you is the thought that descriptivism sees mistakes as variances. While this is *sometimes* the case, descriptivists do still acknowledge that language has rules that need to be followed in order to be understood. So, descriptive and prescriptive rules do sometimes agree with each other, especially when it comes to base grammar rules such as word order (like above) and pluralization (i.e. \"I have three apple\" is ungrammatical both in the descriptive and prescriptive viewpoints). But when it comes to finer points of language, they tend to disagree. Take for example, the word \"funner\". Prescriptivists will tell you that it is not a word, whereas descriptivists will tell you that it is, because the affixation of -er to the end of a description word means it is *\"more so\"* than something else. \n\ntl;dr: Descriptivism *describes* language as it is used, Prescriptivism *prescribes* language as it \"should\" be used. \n\nSecond Response: \nInstead of *correct* and *incorrect*, think *standard* and *non-standard*. In descriptivism, linguists try to discern general rules of grammar (e.g., universal grammar) using language as people actually use it as a basis. \"Shops went the he to,\" is ungrammatical in any variety of English, and why that is is of interest to linguists. Linguists are not trying to redefine Standard English or what vocabulary is appropriate in specific settings.\n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factor leading to this prediction is the depth and engagement of the First Response. It not only defines prescriptivism and descriptivism comprehensively but also directly addresses the original poster's examples, providing a thorough analysis of how descriptive rules still recognize certain grammatical structures. It reassures the original poster that descriptivism doesn't disregard the concept of grammaticality but instead aligns it with structural observations, which adds clarity to their understanding. \n\nAdditionally, the First Response engages more with the original poster's concerns, taking a more explanatory tone that seems geared toward guiding the poster through the complexities of the issue, while the Second Response, although correct, presents a more terse and less empathetic approach.

[It's basically a propaganda term that has become popular only recently, and covers very different sets of laws: copyright, patents, and trademarks.](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.xhtml)\n\nSo maybe you can be more clear. Do you for instance have any problem with trademark laws? Should someone be able to make shoes and slap the name Nike on them? Do you have a problem with patents, like every shoe company not being able to instantly use some new material/configuration introduced with a new Nike product? Or is your CMV simply about copyright, and may be rewritten like 'Copyright violation is not theft'?\n\nSecond Response: \n&gt;Theft: copying something can't possibly be theft because theft requires taking something away and copying doesn't do that.\n\nThinking about IP violations as theft (defined as depriving someone of their rightfully owned property) is, in my mind, a wrong way to go about it. Ownership of something doesn't just mean you have possession of it, but that you have the right to *control its use.* We talk about violations of IP as \"theft\" when in reality, it is closer to a violation of the right to control the property. \n\nSo if a person has a patent on a widget, he has the right to license and control the use of that widget. If he doesn't think it should be used in, say, weapons manufacturing- he has the right to deny the use of his IP in that field. \n\nNow say that a weapons company ignores this and uses the widget anyway. He has been wronged in two senses: first by loss of profits from the use of his widget (wherein the thing stolen is the *profit*, not the widget itself). Second, in the *control of the use* of the widget. The weapons manufacturer didn't deprive the inventor of *possession,* but he did deprive the inventor of *control.* \n\nSo while it may not be theft of the property (on your definition of theft), it *is still a violation of property rights.*\n\nEdit- To the economic utility point: I'm not sure I get your point. The argument in favor of IP is that IP will not be developed without protection for use and profit. This seems clearly correct: say a corporation could steal any patent from any inventor and deprive the inventor of profit or control without fear of reprimand. What incentive would the inventor have to devote time to inventing? What incentive would any person have to do research, when they would not be able to profit from the research.\n\n&gt;What we do know for sure, if a prohibition on commercial copying is implemented, is that individual rights will be violated.\n\nHow?\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "1. **Comparison of Responses**:\n\n   - **Tone and Emotional Approach**:\n     - The **First Response** maintains a somewhat neutral and inquisitive tone, asking questions to clarify the original poster's stance on different aspects of intellectual property.

It forces you to think about what you're saying and make it somewhat concise and intelligible. It allows a back and forth in which both people can contribute equally (since one person can't vocally talk over the other), and you can take more time to understand what the person is saying in the break between each text. In fact, you can now have conversations stretched out over much longer periods of time because of the ability to pace your texts, which you don't get in a phone call. \n\nFurthermore, sometimes passions can easily get inflamed when talking on the phone or face to face (particularly when raising one's voice or making a passionate point). In some cases, texting abstracts that away, since it forces you to type it out (in others cases though, the texts can be misinterpreted and thus lead to arguments).\n\nSo I don't see why texting should be seen a a less valid way of having a full conversation. Sometimes my girlfriend and I prefer calling, other times texting. Either way, we're having a conversation at the end of the day.\n\n", "true_label": "b", "predicted_label": "b", "full_response": "$$Answer: Second Response$$\n\nThe second response effectively argues against the original poster's assertion about texting, employing a more personal and relatable tone.

Otherwise you see people making end-runs around that censorship and finding widespread agreement.  For instance, if you are not allowed to say anything bad about the Emperor, you will inevitably find people sharply criticizing local police while maintaining that \"surely if the Emperor knew he would do something\".\n\nWe have no signs of that.  When you get close to saying something bad (for instance, your post) you aren't punished.  People don't agree on the \"close to saying it\" part because it doesn't match our experience.  To fool us this well, mere censorship would be grossly insufficient - you'd need supernatural mind control.\n\nSecond Response: \nLets imagine a hypothetical: a person from this utopia comes here to try and tell us the truth (happens all the time in North Korea).\n\nNow, what would have to happen to stop us from finding out?\n\n1) massive internet monitoring and a flurry of deleted posts on reddit, facebook, twitter etc.  Have you noticed odd activity like that?\n\n2) If a billboard went up, or a person was handing out fliers, a government force would have to physically detain him.  To do that they would need to know the truth and believe in the rightness of their cause.  North Korea pulls that off by explicit indocrination.  We don'ty have that.  You couldn't count on our cops or military to follow those rules.  So they can't know.  And if our cops and military can't know the truth it means that whoever wants to spread the truth will have a long time to do so before the secret government forces can get from their base in washington to small town Ohio.  And when they arrive they better HOPE that this person didn't go straigth to the local police.  Because if they did the cops are going to resist the secret government forces (and since they are secret they don't have explicit authority and so can, legally, be resisted violently - in fact our police would be under a duty to do so).\n\nAnyways it doesn't work.  We don't have the infrastructe necessary to pull it off.  \n\n", "true_label": "a", "predicted_label": "a", "full_response": "$$Answer: First Response$$\n\nThe key factors leading to this prediction revolve around the tone and emotional approach of each response, along with their engagement style with the original poster's perspective.\n\n1. **Tone and Emotional Approach**: The first response adopts a calm and rational tone that critiques the idea of censorship as inherently broad and almost supernaturally efficient. It walks through the logic of dissent and public opinion, making it more relatable and digestible to the original poster. The second response, while detailed, uses a more dramatic hypothetical scenario that may alienate or overwhelm the original poster rather than engaging directly with their anxieties.\n\n2. **Rhetorical Techniques**: The first response utilizes reasoning and evidence-based arguments to dismantle the notion of extensive censorship, appealing to the original poster's experience. It implicitly validates their concerns by acknowledging them before addressing the flaws in their thinking. On the other hand, the second response relies on an elaborate hypothetical that may lose focus; it doesn't build trust or demonstrate understanding of the original ideas as effectively.\n\n3. **Sentence Structure and Readability**: The first response has a clear structure and is easy to follow, which enhances its persuasive ability. The second response, while informative, includes complex structures and a few grammatical issues (such as \"we don'ty\"), which might distract from its argument.\n\n4. **Engagement with the Original Poster**: The first response shows an understanding of the original poster\u2019s feelings by addressing the idea of censorship directly, providing them with a framework to rethink their views. The second response focuses more on a scenario that may not resonate as deeply with the original poster\u2019s experience.\n\nOverall, the strategic use of calm reasoning, engagement with the original poster's concerns, and concise, clear presentation lead to the first response being more successful in potentially shifting the original poster's perspective.", "is_correct": true}
{"index": 0, "prompt": "\n\nOriginal Post Title: \nCMV: it should be customary for kids to fight their parents back\n\nOriginal Post: \nPosting on my secondary for obvious reasons\n\nI grew up in a extremely abusive house. I dreaded coming home and the site of my mom made my heart skip a beat. Just the sound of her voice made all hairs on my body rise like a cat. Everyday, physically and mentally, she'd wale on me. I *knew* if I wanted, if I *truly* wanted to, I could easily defend myself. I was defiantly in a situation where if we replaced my mom with literally any other human on Earth I would have broke their jaw. She'd pin me against a wall and call me a fag and hit me and hurt me, and I'd take it. Every. Last. Hit. The only thing that every stopped me was knowing I wasn't allowed to. I never knew why, but I knew I couldn't. Because of some fucked up child memories, to this day I still can't take a photo of myself without breaking down or look myself in the eyes or even say i'm \"happy.\" She would call me a sadist and a pessimist, and as years came on I slowly developed these personas. My entire life revolves around the time I spent with her. I cant even count how many times I've wanted to kill myself. I dont say this to attention-whore my way into your web browser, but to use my story as a example. Child abuse fucks people up, badly. I believe the best way to avoid this is to allow a child to hit his parents back, strictly in self defense alone \n\nFirst Response: \n&gt;Child abuse fucks people up, badly. I believe the best way to avoid this is to allow a child to hit his parents back, strictly in self defense alone\n\nI grew up in a similar situation to the one you described, with an alcoholic, physically and verbally abusive father between the ages of 10 and 18. It wasn't until I got a little bigger around 16 that I started hitting back, eventually leading to more serious physical altercations between him and I when I was 18, with our last big fight being the last time I've spoken to him (I'm 26 now).\n\nThat said, there are two things in particular I took from that experience which I believe are contrary to \"this should be customary\";\n\n1. Hitting the man back back didn't make him any less likely to pick fights with me as the years went on, i.e., it did nothing to reduce the level of abuse going on at the time.\n\n2. At the time, being able to hurt him the way he had hurt me over the years *did* bring a (very short-lived) sense of satisfaction, this feeling that he was \"getting what he deserved\". However, that satisfaction never translated into long-term resiliency against the *psychological* effects of his abuse; eight years later, I'm still dealing with avoidant personality disorder and other PTSD-related issues directly related to it. While hitting him back may have helped reduce the number of hits I took during any given altercation, it did nothing to \"defend\" against the long-term psychological repercussions of his actions.\n\nWhile I agree that defending oneself from a physical aggressor, be they muggers or their own parents, should not be looked down upon (and believe you'd be hard-pressed finding someone who disagrees), based on my own experience with a physically abusive parent, fighting your parents shouldn't be seen as a customary way of avoiding future emotional/psychological distress from said abuse.\n\n\nSecond Response: \nI don't want to even claim to tell you what to do. You're an adult and in charge of yourself. That being said, you might want to try to talk with someone who is trained to help people in your situation. There might be services out there that can help you out in your current life. \n\nKids in situations like yours come up with coping strategies to make their situation better. It seems like that's what you did. Even if looking back you made choices you're not proud off it wasn't your fault. You mom was in teh wrong and you were dealing with it. \n\n For some hitting back would be an excellent coping strat. For others it would just escalate the problem\n\njust a question, Are you pretty good at judging other people's mood? Can you tell how someone is feeling just by looking at them?\n\n", "true_label": "b", "error": "Connection error."}

Bush years (2000-2008) will be perceived by future generations as a dark age in world history.\n\nOriginal Post: \nIf any of you frequent /r/badhistory, there is a rather infamous [chart](http://i.imgur.com/zbue8vU.jpg) that captures a popular perception of the Middle Ages as a \"dark age\" that retarded scientific progress by over 1,000 years. This perception is incorrect but is still commonplace. I believe that the Bush years will be viewed similarly by future generations for the following reasons:\n\nThe much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.\n\nBush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.\n\nClimate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.\n\nImperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.\n\nEconomic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been [reversed](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/timworstall/files/2015/01/oxfam1.jpg) by this fucking crisis. Global equity markets are now [as US-centric](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12) as they've ever been since at least the Eighties, meaning that \"the rise of the rest\" has been an utter illusion.\n\nErosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony \"development\" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.\n\nTL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W.

Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.\n\nDifferent methods of counting ballots led to different results.  The methods originally used by the state of Florida, the one proposed by Al Gore's campaign in his lawsuit, and the one used by the Supreme Court all tallied GWB as victor.  The one proposed by the Florida State Supreme Court had Al Gore winning.  I think a newspaper-sponsored recount after the fact (with another, different set of standards) also found that Al Gore got more votes.\n\nBasically, it was a tie, and it turns out in that case the Supreme Court is the tiebreaker.\n\n&gt; Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.\n\nHow?  When has something like that ever happened?  In reality, there was a large body of international opinion that the US should not even go into Afghanistan after Al Queda.  Many foreign governments were on board with it, but their peoples weren't.  If we'd never gone into Iraq all the same people would still hate us.\n\n&gt; Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.\n\nDo you seriously think Obama has made any serious progress on global climate change? How about Clinton?  If the US quit using coal tomorrow it would have no practical effect on climate change.  You need an international consensus and, obviously, electing Obama had no effect on that.\n\n&gt; Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) \n\nCorrelation is not causation.  And if our espionage had been better we would never have gone to war in Iraq in the first place.\n\n&gt; and led to the installation of **treasonous quisling governments** around Europe.\n\n... What in the world are you talking about?\n\n&gt; Economic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. \n\nGuess who forced mortgage giants to start using subprime mortgages in the first place?  Guess who kept Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from being audited in 2005?  Guess who's decided to still keep them alive today?  In all three cases, it was democrats, not GWB.\n\n&gt; The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been reversed by this fucking crisis.\n\nI don't understand how \"share of global wealth\" is a good way to look at well-being.  A better measure is how many people worldwide are actually living in poverty, and [there are fewer and fewer of them](http://ourworldindata.org/data/growth-and-distribution-of-prosperity/world-poverty/).\n\nSecond Response: \nFirst, let me say that I believe Bush was a horrible president, and the country is considerably the worse due to his \"leadership\".  But, I think you are way overstating his influence.\n\n**Bush v. Gore**\nYes, I think the Supremes blew it.  But it was in some ways a testament to our democracy that everyone accepted the process.  The peaceful transition of power, particularly in an unsatisfying way (and whichever way it went, half the country was going to be unsatisfied) is still relatively rare in the world.  I'm far more concerned about Citizens United or gutting the Voting Rights Act, which I think we have a much greater impact on elections and the governance than the Bush v. Gore where I can at least understand the votes.\n\n**Squandered Opportunity for peace**  Agreed, we dropped the ball on this one.  But it wouldn't have stopped Russia's love of imperialism.  It wouldn't have stopped Muslim extremism in the Middle East.  Maybe an FDR could have forged something out of it - but Gore wasn't talented enough of a politician to create a coalition of nations dedicated to wiping out the poverty and ignorance that leads to extremism.  And it was early enough in his term that he wouldn't have the skills, relationships or staff capable of helping him accomplish this.\n\n**Climate change** Congress was not going to pass legislation that would hobble the US economy for the sake of the future.  The threat isn't immediate enough (or perceived as certain enough by most people) for people to support the sort of extreme action that would be required.  Yes, Gore would have worked to reduce our speed in that direction, but he alone couldn't have made a significant enough difference.  He wasn't charismatic enough.  Plus, post 9/11, people would have had other priorities.\n\n**Imperialism**.  Americans were scared shitless after 9/11.  Gore would have been forced to respond.  Likely, as a democrat, he's be under huge pressure to not \"be soft\" on terrorism.  I don't think he would have invaded Iraq, but probably would have done so in Afghanistan.  He would have also taken similar steps on domestic spying.  Remember, this is a guy whose wife lead the \"parental advisory warning on CD's\" movement - not a huge civil libertarian.\n\n**Economic Instability** This can't all be pinned on Bush by a long shot.  [NPR did a great series](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/355/the-giant-pool-of-money) on how the global economic boom created this unprecedented pile of money that needed to be invested somewhere, which lead to the popularity of \"mortgage-backed securities\", which lead to stupid loans, which lead to the global economic collapse.\n\nThere's no question that the amount of [disposable income in countries like China](http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/26/news/economy/china-middle-class/) has increased dramatically, and poverty has decreased.\n\nYes, the distribution of wealth is still screwed, but there is vastly more wealth, which is benefiting many poorer countries.\n\n**TL;DR: it was a time of missed opportunities, and some screw ups, but I don't think it was a tipping point as you suggest, and that even had Gore been elected, things wouldn't have been dramatically different.**\n\n", "true_label": "b", "error": "Connection error."}
